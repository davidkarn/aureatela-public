{"verses":["At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and\nthe half tribe of Manasses,","And said to them:  You have done all that Moses the servant of the\nLord commanded you:  you have also obeyed me in all things,","Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until this\npresent day, keeping the commandment of the Lord your God.","Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and\npeace, as he promised:  return, and go to your dwellings, and to the\nland of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you\nbeyond the Jordan:","Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil the\ncommandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded\nyou:  that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and\nkeep all his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve him with all\nyour heart, and with all your soul.","And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they returned to\ntheir dwellings.","Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a possession\nin Basan:  and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave a lot\namong the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west.  And\nwhen he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them,","He said to them:  With much substance and riches, you return to\nyour settlements, with silver and gold, brass and iron, and variety of\nraiment:  divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren.","So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half\ntribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children of Israel in\nSilo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land of their\npossession, which they had obtained according to the commandment of the\nLord by the hand of Moses.","And when they were come to banks of the Jordan, in the land of\nChanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.","And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and certain\nmessengers brought them an account that the children of Ruben, and of\nGad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of\nChanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over against the children of\nIsrael:","They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against them.","And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad,\nPhinees the son of Eleazar the priest,","And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.","Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half\ntribe of Manasses, into the land of Galaad, and said to them:","Thus saith all the people of the Lord:  What meaneth this\ntransgression?  Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel,\nbuilding a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?","Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and\nthe stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day?  and many of the\npeople perished.","And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath\nwill rage against all Israel.","But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass\nover to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among\nus:  only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an\naltar beside the altar of the Lord our God.","Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the\nLord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel?  And he was but\none man, and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.","And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of\nManasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:","The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he\nknoweth, and Israel also shall understand:  If with the design of\ntransgression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but\npunish us immediately:","And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it\nholocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let him\nrequire and judge:","And not rather with this thought and design, that we should say:\nTo morrow your children will say to our children:  What have you to do\nwith the Lord the God of Israel?","The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and\nyou, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad:  and therefore you\nhave no part in the Lord.  And by this occasion your children shall turn\naway our children from the fear of the Lord.  We therefore thought it\nbest,","And said:  Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to\noffer victims,","But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and\nyours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to\noffer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings:\nand that your children to morrow may not say to our children:  You have\nno part in the Lord.","And if they will say so, they shall answer them:  Behold the\naltar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for\nsacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you.","God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from\nthe Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to\noffer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the\nLord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.","And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage,\nwho were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied:  and they\nadmitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad,\nand of the half tribe of Manasses,","And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them:  Now we\nknow that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this\nrevolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of\nthe Lord.","And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and\nGad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the\nchildren of Israel, and brought them word again.","And the saying pleased all that heard it.  And the children of\nIsrael praised God, and they no longer said that they would go up\nagainst them, and fight, and destroy the land of their possession.","And the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad called the\naltar which they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is God,"]}
