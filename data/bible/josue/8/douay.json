{"verses":["And the Lord said to Josue:  Fear not, nor be thou dismayed:  take\nwith thee all the multitude of fighting men, arise, and go up to the\ntown of Hai:  Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof,\nand the people, and the city, and the land.","And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king thereof, as\nthou hast done to Jericho, and to the king thereof:  but the spoils, and\nall the cattle, you shall take for a prey to yourselves:  lay an ambush\nfor the city behind it.","And Josue arose, and all the army of the fighting men with him, to\ngo up against Hai:  and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in\nthe night,","And commanded them, saying:  Lay an ambush behind the city:  and go\nnot very far from it:  and be ye all ready.","But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with me, will\napproach on the contrary side against the city.  And when they shall\ncome out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we did\nbefore:","Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city:  for they\nwill think that we flee as before.","And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you shall rise out\nof the ambush, and shall destroy the city:  and the Lord your God will\ndeliver it into your hands.","And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you shall do\nall things so as I have commanded.","And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of the\nambush, and abode between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the city\nof Hai.  But Josue staid that night in the midst of the people,","And rising early in the morning, he mustered his soldiers, and\nwent up with the ancients in the front of the army, environed with the\naid of the fighting men.","And when they were come, and were gone up over against the city,\nthey stood on the north side of the city, between which and them there\nwas a valley in the midst.","And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them to lie in\nambush between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same city:","But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north\nside, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of\nthe city.  So Josue went that night, and stood in the midst of the\nvalley.","And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the morning,\nand went out with all the army of the city, and set it in battle array,\ntoward the desert, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his\nback.","But Josue, and all Israel gave back, making as if they were\nafraid, and fleeing by the way of the wilderness.","But they shouting together, and encouraging one another, pursued\nthem.  And when they were come from the city,","And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel, that did\nnot pursue after Israel, leaving the towns open as they had rushed out,","The Lord said to Josue:  Lift up the shield that is in thy hand,\ntowards the city of Hai, for I will deliver it to thee.","And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city, the\nambush, that lay hid, rose up immediately:  and going to the city, took\nit, and set it on fire.","And the men of the city, that pursued after Josue, looking back,\nand seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven, had no more power\nto flee this way or that way:  especially as they that had counterfeited\nflight, and were going toward the wilderness, turned back most\nvaliantly against them that pursued.","So Josue, and all Israel, seeing that the city was taken, and\nthat the smoke of the city rose up, returned, and slew the men of Hai.","And they also that had taken and set the city on fire, issuing\nout of the city to meet their own men, began to cut off the enemies who\nwere surrounded by them.  So that the enemies being cut off on both\nsides, not one of so great a multitude was saved.","And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him\nto Josue.","So all being slain that had pursued after Israel, in his flight\nto the wilderness, and falling by the sword in the same place, the\nchildren of Israel returned and laid waste the city.","And the number of them that fell that day, both of men and women,\nwas twelve thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.","But Josue drew not back his hand, which he had stretched out on\nhigh, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.","And the children of Israel divided among them, the cattle and the\nprey of the city, as the Lord had commanded Josue.","And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:","And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until the evening and\nthe going down of the sun.  Then Josue commanded, and they took down his\ncarcass from the gibbet:  and threw it in the very entrance of the city,\nheaping upon it a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this\npresent day.","Then Josue built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in\nMount Hebal,","As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of\nIsrael, and it is written in the book of the law of Moses:  an altar of\nunhewn stones, which iron had not touched:  and he offered upon it\nholocausts to the Lord, and immolated victims of peace offerings.","And he wrote upon stones, the Deuteronomy of the law of Moses,\nwhich he had ordered before the children of Israel.","And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes, and\njudges, stood on both sides of the ark, before the priests that carried\nthe ark of the covenant of the Lord, both the stranger and he that was\nborn among them, half of them by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount\nHebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord, had commanded.  And first he\nblessed the people of Israel.","After this, he read all the words of the blessing and the\ncursing, and all things that were written in the book of the law.","He left out nothing of those things which Moses had commanded,\nbut he repeated all before all the people of Israel, with the women and\nchildren, and strangers, that dwelt among them."]}
