{"verses":["When Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, had heard these things, to\nwit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had\ndone to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king)\nand that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were their\nconfederates,","He was exceedingly afraid.  For Gabaon was a great city, and one\nof the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its\nfighting men were most valiant.","Therefore Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, sent to Oham, king of\nHebron, and to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king of Lachis,\nand to Dabir, king of Eglon, saying:","Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because\nit hath gone over to Josue, and to the children of Israel.","So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together,\nwent up:  the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of\nJerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies,\nand camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.","But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which was besieged,\nsent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him:\nWithdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants:  come up quickly, and\nsave us, and bring us succour:  for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who\ndwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.","And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors\nwith him, most valiant men.","But the Lord said to Josue:  Fear them not:  for I have delivered\nthem into thy hands:  none of them shall be able to stand against thee.","So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them\nsuddenly.","And the Lord troubled them, at the sight of Israel:  and he slew\nthem with a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of\nthe ascent to Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and\nMaceda.","And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel, and were\nin the descent of Bethoron, the Lord cast down upon them great stones\nfrom heaven, as far as Azeca:  and many more were killed with the\nhailstones, than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel,","Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the\nAmorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before\nthem:  Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the\nvalley of Ajalon.","And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged\nthemselves of their enemies.  Is not this written in the book of the\njust?  So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to\ngo down the space of one day.","There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the Lord obeying\nthe voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.","And Josue returned, with all Israel, into the camp of Galgal.","For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave\nof the city of Maceda.","And it was told Josue, that the five kings were found hid in a\ncave of the city of Maceda.","And he commanded them that were with him, saying:  Roll great\nstones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men to keep them shut\nup:","And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the\nhindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the Lord\nGod hath delivered into your hands, to shelter themselves in their\ncities.","So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost\nutterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel, entered\ninto fenced cities.","And all the army returned to Josue, in Maceda, where the camp\nthen was, in good health, and without the loss of any one:  and no man\ndurst move his tongue against the children of Israel.","And Josue gave orders, saying:  Open the mouth of the cave, and\nbring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.","And the ministers did as they were commanded:  and they brought\nout to him the five kings out of the cave:  the king of Jerusalem, the\nking of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of\nEglon.","And when they were brought out to him, he called all the men of\nIsrael, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him:  Go, and\nset your feet on the necks of these kings.  And when they had gone, and\nput their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,","He said again to them:  Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take\ncourage, and be strong:  for so will the Lord do to all your enemies,\nagainst whom you fight.","And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five\ngibbets; and they hung until the evening.","And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take\nthem down from the gibbets.  And after they were taken down, they cast\nthem into the cave, where they had lain hid, and put great stones at\nthe mouth thereof, which remain until this day.","The same day Josue took Maceda, and destroyed it with the edge\nof the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof:  he\nleft not in it the least remains.  And he did to the king of Maceda, as\nhe had done to the king of Jericho.","And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and fought\nagainst it:","And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands\nof Israel:  and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and\nall the inhabitants thereof.  They left not in it any remains.  And they\ndid to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho.","From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel:  and investing\nit with his army, besieged it.","And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel, and he\ntook it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every soul that\nwas in it, as he had done to Lebna.","At that time Horam, king of Gazer, came up to succour Lachis:\nand Josue slew him with all his people so as to leave none alive.","And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,","And took it the same day:  and put to the sword all the souls\nthat were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.","He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and fought\nagainst it:","Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword:  the king\nalso thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the souls that\ndwelt in it:  he left not therein any remains:  as he had done to Eglon,\nso did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all that he found in it.","Returning from thence to Dabir,","He took it, and destroyed it:  the king also thereof, and all the\ntowns round about, he destroyed with the edge of the sword:  he left not\nin it any remains:  as he had done to Hebron and Lebna, and to their\nkings, so did he to Dabir, and to the king thereof.","So Josue conquered all the country of the hills, and of the\nsouth, and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings:  he left not\nany remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the Lord, the God\nof Israel, had commanded him.","From Cadesbarne even to Gaza.  All the land of Gosen even to\nGabaon,","And all their kings, and their lands he took and wasted at one\nonset:  for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him.","And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in\nGalgal."]}
