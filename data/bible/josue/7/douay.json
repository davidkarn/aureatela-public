{"verses":["But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment, and took\nto their own use of that which was accursed.  For Achan, the son of\nCharmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda, took\nsomething of the anathema:  and the Lord was angry against the children\nof Israel.","And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai, which is beside\nBethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said to them:  Go\nup, and view the country:  and they fulfilled his command, and viewed\nHai.","And returning, they said to him:  Let not all the people go up, but\nlet two or three thousand men go, and destroy the city:  why should all\nthe people be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?","There went up therefore three thousand fighting men:  who\nimmediately turned their backs,","And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and there fell of\nthem six and thirty men:  and the enemies pursued them from the gate as\nfar as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent:  and the\nheart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.","But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground, before\nthe ark of the Lord, until the evening, both he and all the ancients of\nIsrael:  and they put dust upon their heads.","And Josue said:  Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this\npeople over the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the\nAmorrhite, and to destroy us?  would God we had stayed beyond the\nJordan, as we began.","My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs\nto their enemies?","The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of\nit, and being gathered together will surround us, and cut off our name\nfrom the earth:  and what wilt thou do to thy great name?","And the Lord said to Josue:  Arise, why liest thou flat on the\nground?","Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant:  and they have\ntaken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hid it among\ntheir goods.","Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but he shall flee\nfrom them:  because he is defiled with the anathema.  I will be no more\nwith you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness.","Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them:  Be ye sanctified\nagainst tomorrow:  for thus saith the Lord God of Israel:  The curse is\nin the midst of thee, O Israel:  thou canst not stand before thy\nenemies, till he be destroyed out of thee, that is defiled with this\nwickedness.","And you shall come in the morning, every one by your tribes:  and\nwhat tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds,\nand the kindred by its houses and tho house by the men.","And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he\nshall be burnt with fire, with all his substance, because he hath\ntransgressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done wickedness in\nIsrael.","Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made Israel to\ncome by their tribes, and the tribe of Juda was found.","Which being brought by in families, it was found to be the family\nof Zare.  Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi:","And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan, the son of\nCharmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.","And Josue said to Achan:  My son, give glory to the Lord God of\nIsrael, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.","And Achan answered Josue, and said to him:  Indeed I have sinned\nagainst the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.","For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment, exceeding good, and\ntwo hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles:  and I\ncoveted them, and I took them away, and hid them in the ground in the\nmidst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug\nup.","Josue therefore sent ministers:  who running to his tent, found\nall hid in the same place, together with the silver.","And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to Josue,\nand to all the children of Israel, and threw them down before the Lord.","Then Josue, and all Israel with him, took Achan, the son of Zare,\nand the silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his sons also,\nand his daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, the tent also, and\nall the goods:  and brought them to the valley of Achor:","Where Josue said:  Because thou hast troubled us, the Lord trouble\nthee this day.  And all Israel stoned him:  and all things that were his,\nwere consumed with fire.","And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which\nremaineth until this present day And the wrath of the Lord was turned\naway from them.  And the name of that place was called the Valley of\nAchor, until this day."]}
