{"verses":["And the lot of the sons of Joseph fell from the Jordan over\nagainst Jericho and the waters thereof, on the east:  the wilderness\nwhich goeth up from Jericho to the mountain of Bethel:","And goeth out from Bethel to Luza:  and passeth the border of\nArchi, to Ataroth,","And goeth down westward, by the border of Jephleti, unto the\nborders of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gazer:  and the countries of it\nare ended by the great sea:","And Manasses and Ephraim the children of Joseph possessed it.","And the border of the children of Ephraim was according to their\nkindreds:  and their possession towards the east was Ataroth-addar unto\nBeth-horon the upper.","And the confines go out unto the sea:  but Machmethath looketh to\nthe north, and it goeth round the borders eastward into Thanath-selo:\nand passeth along on the east side to Janoe.","And it goeth down from Janoe into Ataroth and Naaratha:  and it\ncometh to Jericho, and goeth out to the Jordan.","From Taphua it passeth on towards the sea into the valley of\nreeds, and the goings out thereof are at the most salt sea.  This is the\npossession of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.","And there were cities with their villages separated for the\nchildren of Ephraim in the midst of the possession of the children of\nManasses.","And the children of Ephraim slew not the Chanaanite, who dwelt\nin Gazer:  and the Chanaanite dwelt in the midst of Ephraim until this\nday, paying tribute."]}
