{"verses":["The Lord shewed me:  and behold two baskets full of figs, set\nbefore the temple of the Lord:  after that Nabuchodonosor king of\nBabylon had carried away Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda,\nand his chief men, and the craftsmen, and engravers of Jerusalem, and\nhad brought them to Babylon.","One basket had very good figs, like the figs of the first season:\nand the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten,\nbecause they were bad.","And the Lord said to me:  What seest thou, Jeremias?  And I said:\nFigs, the good figs, very good:  and the bad figs, very bad, which\ncannot be eaten because they are bad.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel:  Like these good figs, so\nwill I regard the captives of Juda, whom I have sent forth out of this\nplace into the land of the Chaldeans, for their good.","And I will set my eyes upon them to be pacified, and I will bring\nthem again into this land:  and I will build them up, and not pull them\ndown:  and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.","And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord:  and\nthey shall be my people, and I will be their God:  because they shall\nreturn to me with their whole heart.","And as the very bad figs, that cannot be eaten, because they are\nbad:  thus saith the Lord:  So will I give Sedecias the king of Juda, and\nhis princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that have remained in this\ncity, and that dwell in the land of Egypt.","And I will deliver them up to vexation, and affliction, to all\nthe kingdoms of the earth:  to be a reproach, and a byword, and a\nproverb, and to be a curse in all places, to which I have cast them\nout.","And I will send among them the sword, and the famine, and the\npestilence:  till they be consumed out of the land which I gave to them,\nand their fathers."]}
