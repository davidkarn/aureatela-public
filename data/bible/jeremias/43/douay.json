{"verses":["And it came to pass, that when Jeremias had made an end of\nspeaking to the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which\nthe Lord their God had sent him to them, all these words:","Azarias the son of Osaias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and all\nthe proud men, made answer, saying to Jeremias:  Thou tellest a lie:  the\nLord our God hath not sent thee, saying:  Go not into Egypt, to dwell\nthere.","But Baruch the son of Nerias setteth thee on against us, to\ndeliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and to cause us\nto be carried away captives to Babylon.","So Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the\nsoldiers, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to\nremain in the land of Juda.","But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the\nsoldiers took all the remnant of Juda, that were returned out of all\nnations, to which they had before been scattered, to dwell in the land\nof Juda:","Men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every\nsoul, which Nabuzardan the general had left with Godolias the son of\nAhicam the son of Saphan, and Jeremias the prophet, and Baruch the son\nof Nerias.","And they went into the land of Egypt, for they obeyed not the\nvoice of the Lord:  and they came as far as Taphnis.","And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnis, saying:","Take great stones in thy hand, and thou shalt hide them in the\nvault that is under the brick wall at the gate of Pharao's house in\nTaphnis:  in the sight of the men of Juda.","And thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God\nof Israel:  Behold I will send, and take Nabuchodonosor the king of\nBabylon my servant:  and I will set his throne over these stones which I\nhave hid, and he shall set his throne over them.","And he shall come and strike the land of Egypt:  such as are for\ndeath, to death:  and such as are for captivity, to captivity:  and such\nas are for the sword, to the sword.","And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt,\nand he shall burn them, and he shall carry them away captives:  and he\nshall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on\nhis garment:  and he shall go forth from thence in peace.","And he shall break the statues of the house of the sun, that are\nin the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall\nburn with fire."]}
