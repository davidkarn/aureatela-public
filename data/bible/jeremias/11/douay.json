And I\nanswered and said:  Amen, O Lord.","And the Lord said to me:  Proclaim aloud all these words in the\ncities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying:  Hear ye the\nwords of the covenant, and do them:","For protesting I conjured your fathers in the day that I brought\nthem out of the land of Egypt even to this day:  rising early I conjured\nthem, and said:  Hearken ye to my voice:","And they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear:  but walked every one\nin the perverseness of his own wicked heart:  and I brought upon them\nall the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they\ndid them not.","And the Lord said to me:  A conspiracy is found among the men of\nJuda, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","They are returned to the former iniquities of their fathers, who\nrefused to hear my words:  so these likewise have gone after strange\ngods, to serve them:  the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have\nmade void my covenant, which I made with their fathers.","Wherefore thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will bring in evils upon\nthem, which they shall not be able to escape:  and they shall cry to me,\nand I will not hearken to them.","And the cities of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall\ngo, and cry to the gods to whom they offer sacrifice, and they shall\nnot save them in the time of their affliction.","For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda:\nand according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem thou hast set\nup altars of confusion, altars to offer sacrifice to Baalim.","Therefore do not thou pray for this people, and do not take up\npraise and prayer for them:  for I will not hear them in the time of\ntheir cry to me, in the time of their affliction.","What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought much wickedness\nin my house?  shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes, in\nwhich thou hast boasted?","The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive tree, fair,\nfruitful, and beautiful:  at the noise of a word, a great fire was\nkindled in it, and the branches thereof are burnt.","And the Lord of hosts that planted thee, hath pronounced evil\nagainst thee:  for the evils of the house of Israel, and of the house of\nJuda, which they have done to themselves, to provoke me, offering\nsacrifice to Baalim.","But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known:  then thou\nshewedst me their doings.","And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim:  and I\nknew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying:  Let us put\nwood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let\nhis name be remembered no more.","But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and triest the\nreins and the hearts, let me see thy revenge on them:  for to thee have\nI revealed my cause.","Therefore thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth, who seek\nthy life, and say:  Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord, and\nthou shalt not die in our hands.","Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Behold I will visit upon\nthem:  their young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their\ndaughters shall die by famine.","And there shall be no remains of them:  for I will bring in evil\nupon the men of Anathoth, the year of their visitation."]}
