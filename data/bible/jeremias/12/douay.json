{"verses":["Thou indeed, O Lord, art just, if I plead with thee, but yet I\nwill speak what is just to thee:  Why doth the way of the wicked\nprosper:  why is it well with all them that transgress, and do wickedly?","Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root:  they prosper\nand bring forth fruit:  thou art near in their mouth, and far from their\nreins.","And thou, O Lord, hast known me, thou hast seen me, and proved my\nheart with thee:  gather them together as for the day of slaughter.","How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither\nfor the wickedness of them that dwell therein?  The beasts and the birds\nare consumed:  because they have said:  He shall not see our last end.","If thou hast been wearied with running with footmen, how canst\nthou contend with horses?  and if thou hast been secure in a land of\npeace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?","For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they\nhave fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice:\nbelieve them not when they speak good things to thee.","I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance:  I have\ngiven my dear soul into the hand of her enemies.","My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood:  it hath\ncried out against me, therefore have I hated it.","Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird?  is it as a bird dyed\nthroughout?  come ye, assemble yourselves, all ye beasts of the earth,\nmake haste to devour.","Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my\nportion under foot:  they have changed my delightful portion into a\ndesolate wilderness.","They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me.  With\ndesolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none that\nconsidereth in the heart.","The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness, for\nthe sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the\nother end thereof:  there is no peace for all flesh.","They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns:  they have received an\ninheritance, and it shall not profit them:  you shall be ashamed of your\nfruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.","Thus saith the Lord against all wicked neighbours, that touch\nthe inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel:  Behold I\nwill pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the house of Juda\nout of the midst of them.","And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return, and have\nmercy on them:  and will bring them back, every man to his inheritance,\nand every man into his land.","And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and will\nlearn the ways of my people, to swear by my name:  The Lord liveth, as\nthey have taught my people to swear by Baal:  that they shall be built\nup in the midst of my people.","But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and destroy\nthat nation, saith the Lord."]}
