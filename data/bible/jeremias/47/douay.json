{"verses":["The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against\nthe people of Palestine, before Pharao took Gaza.","Thus saith the Lord:  Behold there come up waters out of the\nnorth, and they shall be as an overflowing torrent, and they shall\ncover the land, and all that is therein, the city and the inhabitants\nthereof:  then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land\nshall howl,","At the noise of the marching of arms, and of his soldiers, at the\nrushing of his chariots, and the multitude of his wheels.  The fathers\nhave not looked back to the children, for feebleness of hands,","Because of the coming of the day, in which all the Philistines\nshall be laid waste, and Tyre and Sidon shall be destroyed, with all\nthe rest of their helpers.  For the Lord hath wasted the Philistines,\nthe remnant of the isle of Cappadocia.","Baldness is come upon Gaza:  Ascalon hath held her peace with the\nremnant of their valley:  how long shalt thou cut thyself?","O thou sword of the Lord, how long wilt thou not be quiet?  Go\ninto thy scabbard, rest, and be still.","How shall it be quiet, when the Lord hath given it a charge\nagainst Ascalon, and against the countries thereof by the sea side, and\nthere hath made an appointment for it?"]}
