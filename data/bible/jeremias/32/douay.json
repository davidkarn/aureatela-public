{"verses":["The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the tenth year of\nSedecias king of Juda:  the same is the eighteenth year of\nNabuchodonosor.","At that time the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem:\nand Jeremias the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which\nwas in the house of the king of Juda.","For Sedecias king of Juda had shut him up, saying:  Why dost thou\nprophesy, saying:  Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will give this city\ninto the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it?","And Sedecias king of Juda shall not escape out of the hand of the\nChaldeans:  but he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of\nBabylon:  and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall\nsee his eyes.","And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon:  and he shall be there till\nI visit him, saith the Lord.  But if you will fight against the\nChaldeans, you shall have no success.","And Jeremias said:  The word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Behold, Hanameel the son of Sellum thy cousin shall come to thee,\nsaying:  Buy thee my field, which is in Anathoth, for it is thy right to\nbuy it, being next akin.","And Hanameel my uncle's son came to me, according to the word of\nthe Lord, to the entry of the prison, and said to me:  Buy my field,\nwhich is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:  for the right of\ninheritance is thine, and thou art next of kin to possess it.  And I\nunderstood that this was the word of the Lord.","And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that is in\nAnathoth:  and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten pieces of\nsilver.","And I wrote it in a book and sealed it, and took witnesses:  and\nI weighed him the money in the balances.","And I took the deed of the purchase that was sealed, and the\nstipulations, and the ratifications with the seals that were on the\noutside.","And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neri\nthe son of Maasias in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son, in the\npresence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, and\nbefore all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.","And I charged Baruch before them, saying:","Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Take these\nwritings, this deed of the purchase that is sealed up, and this deed\nthat is open:  and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue\nmany days.","For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Houses, and\nfields, and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.","And after I had delivered the deed of purchase to Baruch the son\nof Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:","Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, behold thou hast made heaven and\nearth by thy great power, and thy stretched out arm:  no word shall be\nhard to thee:","Thou shewest mercy unto thousands, and returnest the iniquity of\nthe fathers into the bosom of their children after them:  O most mighty,\ngreat, and powerful, the Lord of hosts is thy name.","Great in counsel, and incomprehensible in thought:  whose eyes\nare open upon all the ways of the children of Adam, to render unto\nevery one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his\ndevices.","Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even until\nthis day, and in Israel, and amongst men, and hast made thee a name as\nat this day.","And hast brought forth thy people Israel, out of the land of\nEgypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and a\nstretched out arm, and with great terror.","And hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their\nfathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.","And they came in, and possessed it:  but they obeyed not thy\nvoice, and they walked not in thy law:  and they did not any of those\nthings that thou didst command them to do, and all these evils are come\nupon them.","Behold works are built up against the city to take it:  and the\ncity is given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, by\nthe sword, and the famine, and the pestilence:  and what thou hast\nspoken, is all come to pass, as thou thyself seest.","And sayest thou to me, O Lord God:  Buy a field for money, and\ntake witnesses, whereas the city is given into the hands of the\nChaldeans?","And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:","Behold I am the Lord the God of all flesh:  shall any thing be\nhard for me?","Therefore thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will deliver this city\ninto the hands of the Chaldeans, and into the hands of the king of\nBabylon, and they shall take it.","And the Chaldeans that fight against this city, shall come and\nset it on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon whose roofs they\noffered sacrifice to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to strange\ngods, to provoke me to wrath.","For the children of Israel, and the children of Juda, have\ncontinually done evil in my eyes from their youth:  the children of\nIsrael who even till now provoke me with the work of their hands, saith\nthe Lord.","For this city hath been to me a provocation and indignation from\nthe day that they built it, until this day, in which it shall be taken\nout of my sight.","Because of all the evil of the children of Israel, and of the\nchildren of Juda, which they have done, provoking me to wrath, they and\ntheir kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, the\nmen of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","And they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces:\nwhen I taught them early in the morning, and instructed them, and they\nwould not hearken to receive instruction.","And they have set their idols in the house, in which my name is\ncalled upon, to defile it.","And they have built the high places of Baal, which are in the\nvalley of the son of Ennom, to consecrate their sons and their\ndaughters to Moloch:  which I commanded them not, neither entered it\ninto my heart, that they should do this abomination, and cause Juda to\nsin.","And now, therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to\nthis city, whereof you say that it shall be delivered into the hands of\nthe king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence:","Behold I will gather them together out of all the lands to which\nI have cast them out in my anger, and in my wrath, and in my great\nindignation:  and I will bring them again into this place, and will\ncause them to dwell securely.","And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.","And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear\nme all days:  and that it may be well with them, and with their children\nafter them.","And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, and will not\ncease to do them good:  and I will give my fear in their heart, that\nthey may not revolt from me.","And I will rejoice over them, when I shall do them good:  and I\nwill plant them in this land in truth, with my whole heart, and with\nall my soul.","For thus saith the Lord:  As I have brought upon this people all\nthis great evil:  so will I bring upon them all the good that I now\nspeak to them.","And fields shall be purchased in this land:  whereof you say that\nit is desolate, because there remaineth neither man nor beast, and it\nis given into the hands of the Chaldeans.","Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be written,\nand sealed, and witnesses shall be taken, in the land of Benjamin, and\nround about Jerusalem, in the cities of Juda, and in the cities on the\nmountains, and in the cities of the plains, and in the cities that are\ntowards the south:  for I will bring back their captivity, saith the\nLord."]}
