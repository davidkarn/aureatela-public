{"verses":["Woe to the pastors, that destroy and tear the sheep of my\npasture, saith the Lord.","Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the pastors\nthat feed my people:  You have scattered my flock, and driven them away,\nand have not visited them:  behold I will visit upon you for the evil of\nyour doings, saith the Lord.","And I will gather together the remnant of my flock, out of all\nthe lands into which I have cast them out:  and I will make them return\nto their own fields, and they shall increase and be multiplied.","And I will set up pastors over them, and they shall feed them:\nthey shall fear no more, and they shall not be dismayed:  and none shall\nbe wanting of their number, saith the Lord.","Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will raise up to\nDavid a just branch:  and a king shall reign, and shall be wise:  and\nshall execute judgment and justice in the earth.","In those days shall Juda be saved, and Israel shall dwell\nconfidently:  and this is the name that they shall call him:  The Lord\nour just one.","Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and they shall\nsay no more:  The Lord liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out\nof the land of Egypt:","But, The Lord liveth, who hath brought out, and brought hither\nthe seed of the house of Israel from the land of the north, and out of\nall the lands, to which I had cast them forth:  and they shall dwell in\ntheir own land.","To the prophets:  My heart is broken within me, all my bones\ntremble:  I am become as a drunken man, and as a man full of wine, at\nthe presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his holy words.","Because the land is full of adulterers, because the land hath\nmourned by reason of cursing, the fields of the desert are dried up:\nand their course is become evil, and their strength unlike.","For the prophet and the priest are defiled:  and in my house I\nhave found their wickedness, saith the Lord.","Therefore their way shall be as a slippery way in the dark:  for\nthey shall be driven on, and fall therein:  for I will bring evils upon\nthem, the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.","And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria:  they\nprophesied in Baal and deceived my people Israel.","And I have seen the likeness of adulterers, and the way of lying\nin the prophets of Jerusalem:  and they strengthened the hands of the\nwicked, that no man should return from his evil doings, they are all\nbecome unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrha.","Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts to the prophets:  Behold I\nwill feed them with wormwood, and will give them gall to drink:  for\nfrom the prophets of Jerusalem corruption is gone forth into all the\nland.","Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Hearken not to the words of the\nprophets that prophesy to you, and deceive you:  they speak a vision of\ntheir own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.","They say to them that blaspheme me:  The Lord hath said:  You\nshall have peace:  and to every one that walketh in the perverseness of\nhis own heart, they have said:  No evil shall come upon you.","For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath seen and\nheard his word?  Who hath considered his word and heard it?","Behold the whirlwind of the Lord's indignation shall come forth,\nand a tempest shall break out and come upon the head of the wicked.","The wrath of the Lord shall not return till he execute it, and\ntill he accomplish the thought of his heart:  in the latter days you\nshall understand his counsel.","I did not send prophets, yet they ran:  I have not spoken to\nthem, yet they prophesied.","If they had stood in my counsel, and had made my words known to\nmy people, I should have turned them from their evil way, and from\ntheir wicked doings.","Am I, think ye, a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God\nafar off?","Shall a man be hid in secret places, and I not see him, saith\nthe Lord?  do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?","I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my\nname, and say:  I have dreamed, I have dreamed.","How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that\nprophesy lies, and that prophesy the delusions of their own heart?","Who seek to make my people forget my name through their dreams,\nwhich they tell every man to his neighbour:  as their fathers forgot my\nname for Baal.","The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream:  and he that\nhath my word, let him speak my word with truth:  what hath the chaff to\ndo with the wheat, saith the Lord?","Are not my words as a fire, saith the Lord:  and as a hammer that\nbreaketh the rock in pieces?","Therefore behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord:  who\nsteal my words every one from his neighbour.","Behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord:  who use their\ntongues, and say:  The Lord saith it.","Behold I am against the prophets that have lying dreams, saith\nthe Lord:  and tell them, and cause my people to err by their lying, and\nby their wonders:  when I sent them not, nor commanded them, who have\nnot profited this people at all, saith the Lord.","If therefore this people, or the prophet, or the priest shall\nask thee, saying:  What is the burden of the Lord?  thou shalt say to\nthem:  You are the burden:  for I will cast you away, saith the Lord.","And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people that\nshall say:  The burden of the Lord:  I will visit upon that man, and upon\nhis house.","Thus shall you say every one to his neighbour, and to his\nbrother, What hath the Lord answered?  and what hath the Lord spoken?","And the burden of the Lord shall be mentioned no more, for every\nman's word shall be his burden:  for you have perverted the words of the\nliving God, of the Lord of hosts our God.","Thus shalt thou say to the prophet:  What hath the Lord answered\nthee?  and what hath the Lord spoken?","But if you shall say:  The burden of the Lord:  therefore thus\nsaith the Lord:  Because you have said this word:  The burden of the\nLord:  and I have sent to you, saying:  Say not, The burden of the Lord:","Therefore behold I will take you away carrying you, and will\nforsake you, and the city which I gave to you, and to your fathers, out\nof my presence.","And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a\nperpetual shame which shall never be forgotten."]}
