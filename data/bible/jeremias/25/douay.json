{"verses":["The word that came to Jeremias concerning all the people of Juda,\nin the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, (the same\nis the first year of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon,)","Which Jeremias the prophet spoke to all the people of Juda, and\nto all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:","From the thirteenth year of Josias the son of Ammon king of Juda\nuntil this day:  this is the three and twentieth year, the word of the\nLord hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising before day, and\nspeaking, and you have not hearkened.","And the Lord hath sent to you all his servants the prophets,\nrising early, and sending, and you have not hearkened, nor inclined\nyour ears to hear.","When he said:  Return ye, every one from his evil way, and from\nyour wicked devices, and you shall dwell in the land which the Lord\nhath given to you, and your fathers for ever and ever.","And go not after strange gods to serve them, and adore them:  nor\nprovoke me to wrath by the works of your hands, and I will not afflict\nyou.","And you have not heard me, saith the Lord, that you might provoke\nme to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.","Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Because you have not\nheard my words:","Behold I will send, and take all the kindreds of the north, saith\nthe Lord, and Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my servant:  and I will\nbring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and\nagainst all the nations that are round about it:  and I will destroy\nthem, and make them an astonishment and a hissing, and perpetual\ndesolations.","And I will take away from them the voice of mirth, and the voice\nof gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,\nthe sound of the mill and the light of the lamp.","And all this land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment:\nand all these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.","And when the seventy years shall be expired, I will punish the\nking of Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord, for their iniquity,\nand the land of the Chaldeans:  and I will make it perpetual\ndesolations.","And I will bring upon that land all my words, that I have spoken\nagainst it, all that is written in this book, all that Jeremias hath\nprophesied against all nations:","For they have served them, whereas they were many nations, and\ngreat kings:  and I will repay them according to their deeds, and\naccording to the works of their hands.","For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Take the cup\nof wine of this fury at my hand:  and thou shalt make all the nations to\ndrink thereof, into which I shall send thee.","And they shall drink, and be troubled, and be mad because of the\nsword, which I shall send among them.","And I took the cup at the hand of the Lord, and I presented it\nto all the nations to drink of it, to which the Lord sent me:","To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and the kings\nthereof, and the princes thereof:  to make them a desolation, and an\nastonishment, and a hissing, and a curse, as it is at this day.","Pharao the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and\nall his people,","And all in general:  all the kings of the land of Ausitis, and\nall the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ascalon, and Gaza,\nand Accaron, and the remnant of Azotus.","And Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon.","And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon:  and the\nkings of the land of the islands that are beyond the sea.","And Dedan, and Thema, and Buz, and all that have their hair cut\nround.","And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the west, that\ndwell in the desert.","And all the kings of Zambri, and all the kings of Elam, and all\nthe kings of the Medes:","And all the kings of the north far and near, every one against\nhis brother:  and all the kingdoms of the earth, which are upon the face\nthereof:  and the king of Sesac shall drink after them.","And thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God\nof Israel:  Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit:  and fall, and rise no\nmore, because of the sword, which I shall send among you.","And if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, thou\nshalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Drinking you shall\ndrink:","For behold I begin to bring evil on the city wherein my name is\ncalled upon:  and shall you be as innocent and escape free?  you shall\nnot escape free:  for I will call for the sword upon all the inhabitants\nof the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.","And thou shalt prophesy unto them all these words, and thou\nshalt say to them:  I The Lord shall roar from on high, and shall utter\nhis voice from his holy habitation:  roaring he shall roar upon the\nplace of his beauty:  the shout as it were of them that tread grapes\nshall be given out against all the inhabitants of the earth.","The noise is come even to the ends of the earth:  for the Lord\nentereth into judgment with the nations:  he entereth into judgment with\nall flesh; the wicked I have delivered up to the sword, saith the Lord.","Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Behold evil shall go forth from\nnation to nation:  and a great whirlwind shall go forth from the ends of\nthe earth.","And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of\nthe earth even to the other end thereof:  they shall not be lamented,\nand they shall not be gathered up, nor buried:  they shall lie as dung\nupon the face of the earth.","Howl, ye shepherds, and cry:  and sprinkle yourselves with ashes,\nye leaders of the flock:  for the days of your slaughter and your\ndispersion are accomplished, and you shall fall like precious vessels.","And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the leaders of\nthe flock to save themselves.","A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the\nprincipal of the flock:  because the Lord hath wasted their pastures.","And the fields of peace have been silent because of the fierce\nanger of the Lord.","He hath forsaken his covert as the lion, for the land is laid\nwaste because of the wrath of the dove, and because of the fierce anger\nof the Lord."]}
