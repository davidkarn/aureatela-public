{"verses":["The word that came to Jeremias, concerning all the Jews that\ndwelt in the land of Egypt, dwelling in Magdal, and in Taphnis, and in\nMemphis, and in the land of Phatures, saying:","Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  You have seen all\nthis evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities\nof Juda:  and behold they are desolate this day, and there is not an\ninhabitant in them:","Because of the wickedness which they have committed, to provoke\nme to wrath, and to go and offer sacrifice, and worship other gods,\nwhich neither they, nor you, nor your fathers knew.","And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and\nsending, and saying:  Do not commit this abominable thing, which I hate.","But they heard not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their\nevil ways, and not to sacrifice to strange gods.","Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth, and was\nkindled in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem:  and\nthey are turned to desolation and waste, as at this day.","And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Why do\nyou commit this great evil against your own souls, that there should\ndie of you man and woman, child and suckling out of the midst of Juda,\nand no remnant should be left you:","In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, by\nsacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which you are come\nto dwell there:  and that you should perish, and be a curse, and a\nreproach to all the nations of the earth?","Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of\nthe kings of Juda, and the evils of their wives, and your evils, and\nthe evils of your wives, that they have done in the land of Juda, and\nin the streets of Jerusalem?","They are not cleansed even to this day:  neither have they\nfeared, nor walked in the law of the Lord, nor in my commandments,\nwhich I set before you and your fathers.","Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Behold\nI will set my face upon you for evil:  and I will destroy all Juda.","And I will take the remnant of Juda that have set their faces to\ngo into the land of Egypt, and to dwell there; and they shall be all\nconsumed in the land of Egypt:  they shall fall by the sword, and by the\nfamine:  and they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest,\nby the sword, and by the famine shall they die:  and they shall be for\nan execration, and for a wonder, and for a curse, and for a reproach.","And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have\nvisited Jerusalem by the sword, and by famine and by pestilence.","And there shall be none that shall escape, and remain of the\nremnant of the Jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of Egypt:  and\nthat shall return into the land of Juda, to which they have a desire to\nreturn to dwell there:  there shall none return but they that shall\nflee.","Then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to other\ngods:  and all the women of whom there stood by a great multitude, and\nall the people of them that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Phatures,\nanswered Jeremias, saying:","As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the\nLord, we will not hearken to thee:","But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of\nour own mouth, to sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out\ndrink offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, our kings, and\nour princes in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem:  and\nwe were filled with bread, and it was well with us, and we saw no evil.","But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven,\nand to pour out frank offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and\nhave been consumed by the sword, and by famine.","And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and pour out\ndrink offerings to her:  did we make cakes to worship her, to pour out\ndrink offerings to her, without our husbands?","And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the men, and to the\nwomen, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying:","Was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities of Juda,\nand in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings, and\nyour princes, and the people of the land, which the Lord hath\nremembered, and hath it not entered into his heart?","So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of\nyour doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed:\ntherefore your land is become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a\ncurse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.","Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned against\nthe Lord:  and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have not\nwalked in his law, and in his commandments, and in his testimonies:\ntherefore are these evils come upon you, as at this day.","And Jeremias said to all the people and to all the women:  Hear\nye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt:","Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, saying:  You and\nyour wives have spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled with your hands,\nsaying:  Let us perform our vows which we have made, to offer sacrifice\nto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her:  you\nhave fulfilled your vows, and have performed them indeed.","Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell\nin the land of Egypt:  Behold I have sworn by my great name, saith the\nLord:  that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of\nJuda, in the land of Egypt, saying:  The Lord God liveth.","Behold I will watch over them for evil, and not for good:  and\nall the men of Juda that are in the land of Egypt, shall be consumed,\nby the sword, and by famine, till there be an end of them.","And a few men that shall flee from the sword, shall return out\nof the land of Egypt into the land of Juda:  and all the remnant of Juda\nthat are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose\nword shall stand, mine, or theirs.","And this shall be a sign to you, saith the Lord, that I will\npunish you in this place:  that you may know that my words shall be\naccomplished indeed against you for evil.","Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will deliver Pharao Nechao king of\nEgypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek\nhis life:  as I delivered Sedecias king of Juda into the land of\nNabuchodonosor the king of Babylon his enemy, and that sought his life."]}
