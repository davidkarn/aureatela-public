{"verses":["The word that Jeremias the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of\nNerias, when he had written these words in a book, out of the mouth of\nJeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda,\nsaying:","Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to thee, Baruch:","Thou hast said:  Woe is me, wretch that I am, for the Lord hath\nadded sorrow to my sorrow:  I am wearied with my groans, and I find no\nrest.","Thus saith the Lord:  Thus shalt thou say to him:  Behold, them\nwhom I have built, I do destroy:  and them whom I have planted, I do\npluck up, and all this land.","And dost thou seek great things for thyself?  Seek not:  for behold\nI will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord! but I will give thee\nthy life, and save thee in all places whithersoever thou shalt go."]}
