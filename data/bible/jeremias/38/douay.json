{"verses":["Now Saphatias the son of Mathan, and Gedelias the son of Phassur,\nand Juchal the son of Selemias, and Phassur the son of Melchias heard\nthe words that Jeremias spoke to all the people, saying:","Thus saith the Lord:  Whosoever shall remain in this city, shall\ndie by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence:  but he that shall\ngo forth to the Chaldeans, shall live, and his life shall be safe, and\nhe shall live.","Thus saith the Lord:  This city shall surely be delivered into the\nhand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.","And the princes said to the king.  We beseech thee that this man\nmay be put to death:  for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men\nof war, that remain in this city, and the hands of the people, speaking\nto them according to these words:  for this man seeketh not peace to\nthis people, but evil.","And king Sedecias said:  Behold he is in your hands:  for it is not\nlawful for the king to deny you any thing.","Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias\nthe son of Amelech, which was in the entry of the prison:  and they let\ndown Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there was no water,\nbut mire.  And Jeremias sunk into the mire.","Now Abdemelech the Ethiopian, an eunuch that was in the king's\nhouse, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon:  but the king\nwas sitting in the gate of Benjamin.","And Abdemelech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the\nking, saying:","My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have\ndone against Jeremias the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die\nthere with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.","Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying:  Take\nfrom hence thirty men with thee, and draw up Jeremias the prophet out\nof the dungeon, before he die.","So Abdemelech taking the men with him, went into the king's\nhouse that was under the storehouse:  and he took from thence old rags,\nand old rotten things, and he let them down by cords to Jeremias into\nthe dungeon.","And Abdemelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremias:  Put these old\nrags and these rent and rotten things under thy arms, and upon the\ncords:  and Jeremias did so.","And they drew up Jeremias with the cords, and brought him forth\nout of the dungeon.  And Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.","And king Sedecias sent, and took Jeremias the prophet to him to\nthe third gate, that was in the house of the Lord:  and the king said to\nJeremias:  I will ask thee a thing, hide nothing from me.","Then Jeremias said to Sedecias:  If I shall declare it to thee,\nwilt thou not put me to death?  and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt\nnot hearken to me.","Then king Sedecias swore to Jeremias, in private, saying:  As the\nLord liveth, that, made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor\nwill I deliver thee into the hands of these men that seek thy life.","And Jeremias said to Sedecias:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts the\nGod of Israel:  If thou wilt take a resolution and go out to the princes\nof the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be\nburnt with fire:  and thou shalt be safe, and thy house.","But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of\nBabylon, this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans,\nand they shall burn it with fire:  and thou shalt not escape out of\ntheir hand.","And king Sedecias said to Jeremias:  I am afraid because of the\nJews that are fled over to the Chaldeans:  lest I should be delivered\ninto their hands, and they should abuse me.","But Jeremias answered:  They shall not deliver thee:  hearken, I\nbeseech thee, to the word of the Lord, which I speak to the, and it\nshall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.","But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord\nhath shewn me:","Behold all the women that are left in the house of the king of\nJuda, shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon:  and\nthey shall say:  Thy men of peace have deceived thee, and have prevailed\nagainst thee, they have plunged thy feet in the mire, and in a slippery\nplace and they have departed from thee.","And all thy wives, and thy children shall be brought out to the\nChaldeans, and thou shalt not escape their hands, but thou shalt be\ntaken by the hand of the king of Babylon:  and he shall burn this city\nwith fire.","Then Sedecias said to Jeremias:  Let no man know these words, and\nthou shalt not die.","But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee, and\nshall come to thee, and say to thee:  Tell us what thou hast said to the\nking, hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee:  and also what the\nking said to thee:","Thou shalt say to them:  I presented my supplication before the\nking, that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of\nJonathan, to die there.","So all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him:  and he spoke\nto them according to all the words that the king had commanded him:  and\nthey left him:  for nothing had been heard.","But Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison, until the day\nthat Jerusalem was taken:  and it came to pass that Jerusalem was taken."]}
