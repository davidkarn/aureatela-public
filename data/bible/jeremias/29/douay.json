{"verses":["Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremias the prophet\nsent from Jerusalem to the residue of the ancients that were carried\ninto captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the\npeople, whom Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:","After that Jechonias the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs,\nand the princes of Juda, and of Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the\nengravers were departed out of Jerusalem:","By the hand of Elasa the son of Saphan, and Gamarias the son of\nHelcias, whom Sedecias king of Juda sent to Babylon to Nabuchodonosor\nking of Babylon, saying:","Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to all that are\ncarried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from\nJerusalem to Babylon:","Build ye houses, and dwell in them:  and plant orchards, and eat\nthe fruit of them.","Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters:  and take wives for\nyour sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and let them bear sons\nand daughters:  and be ye multiplied there, and be not few in number.","And seek the peace of the city, to which I have caused you to be\ncarried away captives; and pray to the Lord for it:  for in the peace\nthereof shall be your peace.","For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Let not your\nprophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners deceive you:\nand give no heed to your dreams which you dream:","For they prophesy falsely to you in my name:  and I have not sent\nthem, saith the Lord.","For thus saith the Lord:  When the seventy years shall begin to\nbe accomplished in Babylon, I will visit you:  and I will perform my\ngood word in your favour, to bring you again to this place.","For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the\nLord, thoughts of peace, and not of affliction, to give you an end and\npatience.","And you shall call upon me, and you shall go.  and you shall pray\nto me, and I will hear you.","You shall seek me, and shall find me:  when you shall seek me\nwith all your heart.","And I will be found by you, saith the Lord:  and I will bring\nback your captivity, and I will gather you out of all nations, and from\nall the places to which I have driven you out, saith the Lord:  and I\nwill bring you back from the place to which I caused you to be carried\naway captive.","Because you have said:  The Lord hath raised us up prophets in\nBabylon:","For thus saith the Lord to the king that sitteth upon the throne\nof David, and to all the people that dwell in this city, to your\nbrethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity.","Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Behold I will send upon them the\nsword, and the famine, and the pestilence:  and I will make them like\nbad figs that cannot be eaten, because they are very bad.","And I will persecute them with the sword, and with famine, and\nwith the pestilence:  and I will give them up unto affliction to all the\nkingdoms of the earth:  to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a\nhissing, and a reproach to all the nations to which I have driven them\nout:","Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord:\nwhich I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising by night, and\nsending:  and you have not heard, saith the Lord.","Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the captivity,\nwhom I have sent out from Jerusalem to Babylon.","Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to Achab the son\nof Colias, and to Sedecias the son of Maasias, who prophesy unto you in\nmy name falsely:  Behold I will deliver them up into the hands of\nNabuchodonosor the king of Babylon:  and he shall kill them before your\neyes.","And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of\nJuda, that are in Babylon, saying:  The Lord make thee like Sedecias,\nand like Achab, whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire:","Because they have acted folly in Israel, and have committed\nadultery with the wives of their friends, and have spoken lying words\nin my name, which I commanded them not:  I am the judge and the witness,\nsaith the Lord.","And to Semeias the Nehelamite thou shalt say:","Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Because thou\nhast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are in Jerusalem,\nand to Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest, and to all the priests,\nsaying:","The Lord hath made thee priest instead of Joiada the priest,\nthat thou shouldst be ruler in the house of the Lord, over every man\nthat raveth and prophesieth, to put him in the stocks, and into prison.","And now why hast thou not rebuked Jeremias the Anathothite, who\nprophesieth to you?","For he hath also sent to us in Babylon, saying:  It is a long\ntime:  build ye houses, and dwell in them:  and plant gardens, and eat\nthe fruits of them.","So Sophonias the priest read this letter, in the hearing of\nJeremias the prophet.","And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:","Send to all them of the captivity, saying:  Thus saith the Lord\nto Semeias the Nehelamite:  Because Semeias hath prophesied to you, and\nI sent him not:  and hath caused you to trust in a lie:","Therefore thus saith the Lord:  behold I will visit upon Semeias\nthe Nehelamite, and upon his seed:  he shall not have a man to sit in\nthe midst of this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do\nto my people, saith the Lord:  because he hath spoken treason against\nthe Lord."]}
