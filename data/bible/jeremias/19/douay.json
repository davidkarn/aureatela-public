{"verses":["Thus saith the Lord:  Go, and take a potter's earthen bottle, and\ntake of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests:","And go forth into the valley of the son of Ennom, which is by the\nentry of the earthen gate:  and there thou shalt proclaim the words that\nI shall tell thee.","And thou shalt say:  Hear the word of the Lord, O ye kings of\nJuda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts,\nthe God of Israel:  Behold I will bring an affliction upon this place:\nso that whosoever shall hear it, his ears shall tingle:","Because they have forsaken me, and have profaned this place :  and\nhave sacrificed therein to strange gods, whom neither they nor their\nfathers knew, nor the kings of Juda:  and they have filled this place\nwith the blood of innocents.","And they have built the high places of Baalim, to burn their\nchildren with fire for a holocaust to Baalim:  which I did not command,\nnor speak of, neither did it once come into my mind.","Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, that this place\nshall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Ennom,\nbut the valley of slaughter.","And I will defeat the counsel of Juda and of Jerusalem in this\nplace:  and I will destroy them with the sword in the sight of their\nenemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives:  and I will\ngive their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the\nbeasts of the earth.","And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing:  every\none that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss because\nof all the plagues thereof.","And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and with the\nflesh of their daughters:  and they shall eat every one the flesh of his\nfriend in the siege, and in the distress wherewith their enemies, and\nthey that seek their lives, shall straiten them.","And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that\nshall go with thee.","And thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Even\nso will I break this people, and this city, as the potter's vessel is\nbroken, which cannot be made whole again:  and they shall be buried in\nTopheth, because there is no other place to bury in.","Thus will I do to this place, saith the Lord, and to the\ninhabitants thereof:  and I will make this city as Topheth.","And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Juda\nshall be unclean as the place of Topheth:  all the houses upon whose\nroofs they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven, and have poured\nout drink offerings to strange gods.","Then Jeremias came from Topheth, whither the Lord had sent him\nto prophesy, and he stood in the court of the house of the Lord, and\nsaid to all the people:","Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:  Behold I will\nbring in upon this city, and upon all the cities thereof all the evils\nthat I have spoken against it:  because they have hardened their necks,\nthat they might not hear my words."]}
