{"verses":["The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:","Arise, and go down into the potter's house, and there thou shalt\nhear my words.","And I went down into the potter's house, and behold he was doing\na work on the wheel.","And the vessel was broken which he was making of clay with his\nhands:  and turning he made another vessel, as it seemed good in his\neyes to make it.","Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Cannot I do with you, as this potter, O house of Israel, saith\nthe Lord?  behold as clay is in the hand of the potter, so are you in my\nhand, O house of Israel.","I will suddenly speak against a nation, and against a kingdom, to\nroot out, and to pull down, and to destroy it.","If that nation against which I have spoken, shall repent of their\nevil, I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to them.","And I will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom, to build\nup and plant it.","If it shall do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice:  I\nwill repent of the good that I have spoken to do unto it.","Now therefore tell the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of\nJerusalem, saying:  Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I frame evil against\nyou, and devise a device against you:  let every man of you return from\nhis evil way, and make ye your ways and your doings good.","And they said; We have no hopes:  for we will go after our own\nthoughts, and we will do every one according to the perverseness of his\nevil heart.","Therefore thus saith the Lord:  Ask among the nations:  Who hath\nheard such horrible things, as the virgin of Israel hath done to\nexcess?","Shall the snow of Libanus fail from the rock of the field?  or\ncan the cold waters that gush out and run down, be taken away?","Because my people have forgotten me, sacrificing in vain, and\nstumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to walk by them in a way not\ntrodden:","That their land might be given up to desolation, and to a\nperpetual hissing:  every one that shall pass by it, shall be\nastonished, and wag his head.","As a burning wind will I scatter them before the enemy:  I will\nshew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their destruction.","And they said:  Come, and let us invent devices against Jeremias:\nfor the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the\nwise, nor the word from the prophet:  come, and let us strike him with\nthe tongue, and let us give no heed to all his words.","Give heed to me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my adversaries.","Shall evil be rendered for good, because they have digged a pit\nfor my soul?  Remember that I have stood in thy sight, to speak good for\nthem, and to turn away thy indignation from them.","Therefore deliver up their children to famine, and bring them\ninto the hands of the sword:  let their wives be bereaved of children\nand widows:  and let their husbands be slain by death:  let their young\nmen be stabbed with the sword in battle.","Let a cry be heard out of their houses:  for thou shalt bring the\nrobber upon them suddenly:  because they have digged a pit to take me,\nand have hid snares for my feet.","But thou, O Lord, knowest all their counsel against me unto\ndeath:  not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from\nthy sight:  let them be overthrown before thy eyes, in the time of thy\nwrath do thou destroy them."]}
