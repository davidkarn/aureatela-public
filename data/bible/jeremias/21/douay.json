{"verses":["The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, when king Sedecias\nsent unto him Phassur, the son of Melchias, and Sophonias, the son of\nMaasias the priest, saying:","Inquire of the Lord for us, for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon\nmaketh war against us:  if so be the Lord will deal with us according to\nall his wonderful works, that he may depart from us.","And Jeremias said to them:  Thus shall you say to Sedecias:","Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel:  Behold I will turn back\nthe weapons of war that are in your hands, and with which you fight\nagainst the king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans, that besiege you round\nabout the walls:  and I will gather them together in the midst of this\ncity.","And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand,\nand with a strong arm, and in fury, and in indignation, and in great\nwrath.","And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, men and beasts\nshall die of a great pestilence.","And after this, saith the Lord, I will give Sedecias the king of\nJuda, and his servants, and his people, and such as are left in this\ncity from the pestilence, and the sword, and the famine, into the hand\nof Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their\nenemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and he shall\nstrike them with the edge of the sword, and he shall not be moved to\npity, nor spare them, nor shew mercy to them.","And to this people thou shalt say:  Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I\nset before you the way of life, and the way of death.","He that shall abide in this city, shall die by the sword, and by\nthe famine, and by the pestilence:  but he that shall go out and flee\nover to the Chaldeans, that besiege you, shall live, and his life shall\nbe to him as a spoil.","For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for\ngood, saith the Lord:  it shall be given into the hand of the king of\nBabylon, and he shall burn it with fire.","And to the house of the king of Juda:  Hear ye the word of the\nLord,","O house of David, thus saith the Lord:  Judge ye judgment in the\nmorning, and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the hand\nof the oppressor:  lest my indignation go forth like a fire, and be\nkindled, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your\nways.","Behold I come to thee that dwellest in a valley upon a rock\nabove a plain, saith the Lord:  and you say:  Who shall strike us and who\nshall enter into our houses?","But I will visit upon you according to the fruit of your doings,\nsaith the Lord:  and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof:  and it\nshall devour all things round about it."]}
