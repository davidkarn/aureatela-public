{"verses":["But not long after the king sent a certain old man of Antioch, to\ncompel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers and of God:","And to defile the temple that was in Jerusalem, and to call it the\ntemple of Jupiter Olympius:  and that in Garazim of Jupiter Hospitalis,\naccording as they were that inhabited the place.","And very bad was this invasion of evils, and grievous to all.","For the temple was full of the riot and revellings of the\nGentiles:  and of men lying with lewd women.  And women thrust themselves\nof their accord into the holy places, and brought in things that were\nnot lawful.","The altar also was filled with unlawful things, which were\nforbidden by the laws.","And neither were the sabbaths kept, nor the solemn days of the\nfathers observed, neither did any man plainly profess himself to be a\nJew.","But they were led by bitter constraint on the king's birthday to\nthe sacrifices:  and when the feast of Bacchus was kept, they were\ncompelled to go about crowned with ivy in honour of Bacchus.","And there went out a decree into the neighbouring cities of the\nGentiles, by the suggestion of the Ptolemeans, that they also should\nact in like manner against the Jews, to oblige them to sacrifice:","And whosoever would not conform themselves to the ways of the\nGentiles, should be put to death:  then was misery to be seen.","For two women were accused to have circumcised their children:\nwhom, when they had openly led about through the city, with the infants\nhanging at their breasts, they threw down headlong from the walls.","And others that had met together in caves that were near, and\nwere keeping the sabbath day privately, being discovered by Philip,\nwere burnt with fire, because they made a conscience to help themselves\nwith their hands, by reason of the religious observance of the day.","Now I beseech those that shall read this book, that they be not\nshocked at these calamities, but that they consider the things that\nhappened, not as being for the destruction, but for the correction of\nour nation.","For it is a token of great goodness, when sinners are not\nsuffered to go on in their ways for a long time, but are presently\npunished.","For, not as with other nations, (whom the Lord patiently\nexpecteth, that when the day of judgment shall come, he may punish them\nin the fulness of their sins:)","Doth he also deal with us, so as to suffer our sins to come to\ntheir height, and then take vengeance on us.","And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us:  but though\nhe chastise his people with adversity he forsaketh them not.","But let this suffice in a few words for a warning to the readers.\nAnd now we must come to the narration.","Eleazar one of the chief of the scribes, a man advanced in years,\nand of a comely countenance, was pressed to open his mouth to eat\nswine's flesh.","But he, choosing rather a most glorious death than a hateful\nlife, went forward voluntarily to the torment.","And considering in what manner he was to come to it, patiently\nbearing, he determined not to do any unlawful things for the love of\nlife.","But they that stood by, being moved with wicked pity, for the old\nfriendship they had with the man, taking him aside, desired that flesh\nmight be brought which it was lawful for him to eat, that he might make\nas if he had eaten, as the king had commanded, of the flesh of the\nsacrifice:","That by so doing he might be delivered from death; and for the\nsake of their old friendship with the man, they did him this courtesy.","But he began to consider the dignity of his age, and his ancient\nyears, and the inbred honour of his grey head, and his good life and\nconversation from a child; and he answered without delay, according to\nthe ordinances of the holy law made by God, saying, that he would\nrather be sent into the other world.","For it doth not become our age, said he, to dissemble:  whereby\nmany young persons might think that Eleazar, at the age of fourscore\nand ten years, was gone over to the life of the heathens:","And so they, through my dissimulation, and for a little time of a\ncorruptible life, should be deceived, and hereby I should bring a stain\nand a curse upon my old age.","For though, for the present time, I should be delivered from the\npunishments of men, yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty\nneither alive nor dead.","Wherefore, by departing manfully out of this life, I shall shew\nmyself worthy of my old age:","And I shall leave an example of fortitude to young men, if with a\nready mind and constancy I suffer an honourable death, for the most\nvenerable and most holy laws.  And having spoken thus, he was forthwith\ncarried to execution.","And they that led him, and had been a little before more mild,\nwere changed to wrath for the words he had spoken, which they thought\nwere uttered out of arrogancy.","But when be was now ready to die with the stripes, he groaned:\nand said:  O Lord, who hast the holy knowledge, thou knowest manifestly\nthat whereas I might be delivered from death, I suffer grievous pains\nin body:  but in soul am well content to suffer these things, because I\nfear thee.","Thus did this man die, leaving not only to young men, but also to\nthe whole nation, the memory of his death, for an example of virtue and\nfortitude."]}
