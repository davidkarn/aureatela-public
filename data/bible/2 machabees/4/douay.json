{"verses":["But Simon, of whom we spoke before, who was the betrayer of the\nmoney, and of his country, spoke ill of Onias, as though he had incited\nHeliodorus to do these things, and had been the promoter of evils:","And he presumed to call him a traitor to the kingdom, who provided\nfor the city, and defended his nation, and was zealous for the law of\nGod.","But when the enmities proceeded so far, that murders also were\ncommitted by some of Simon's friends:","Onias, considering the danger of this contention, and that\nApollonius, who was the governor of Celesyia, and Phenicia, was\noutrageous, which increased the malice of Simon, went to the king,","Not to be an accuser of his countrymen, but with view to the\ncommon good of all the people.","For he saw that, except the king took care, it was impossible that\nmatters should be settled in peace, or that Simon would cease from his\nfolly.","But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, who was called\nthe Illustrious, had taken possession of the kingdom, Jason, the\nbrother of Onias, ambitiously sought the high priesthood:","And went to the king, promising him three hundred and sixty\ntalents of silver, and out of other revenues fourscore talents.","Besides this he promised also a hundred and fifty more, if he\nmight have license to set him up a place for exercise, and a place for\nyouth, and to entitle them that were at Jerusalem, Antiochians.","Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten the rule into\nhis hands, forthwith he began to bring over his countrymen to the\nfashion of the heathens.","And abolishing those things, which had been decreed of special\nfavour by the kings in behalf of the Jews, by the means of John, the\nfather of that Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome to make amity and\nalliance, he disannulled the lawful ordinances of the citizens, and\nbrought in fashions that were perverse.","For he had the boldness to set up, under the very castle, a place\nof exercise, and to put all the choicest youths in brothel houses.","Now this was not the beginning, but an increase, and progress of\nheathenish and foreign manners, through the abominable and unheard of\nwickedness of Jason, that impious wretch, and no priest.","Insomuch that the priests were not now occupied about the offices\nof the altar, but despising the temple and neglecting the sacrifices,\nhastened to be partakers of the games, and of the unlawful allowance\nthereof, and of the exercise of the discus.","And setting nought by the honours of their fathers, they esteemed\nthe Grecian glories for the best:","For the sake of which they incurred a dangerous contention, and\nfollowed earnestly their ordinances, and in all things they coveted to\nbe like them, who were their enemies and murderers.","For acting wickedly against the laws of God doth not pass\nunpunished:  but this the time following will declare.","Now when the game that was used every fifth year was kept at\nTyre, the king being present,","The wicked Jason sent from Jerusalem sinful men, to carry three\nhundred didrachmas of silver for the sacrifice of Hercules; but the\nbearers thereof desired it might not be bestowed on the sacrifices,\nbecause it was not necessary, but might be deputed for other charges.","So the money was appointed by him that sent it to the sacrifice\nof Hercules:  but because of them that carried it was employed for the\nmaking of galleys.","Now when Apollonius, the son of Mnestheus was sent into Egypt to\ntreat with the nobles of king Philometor, and Antiochus understood that\nhe was wholly excluded from the affairs of the kingdom, consulting his\nown interest, he departed thence and came to Joppe, and from thence to\nJerusalem.","Where he was received in a magnificent manner by Jason, and the\ncity, and came in with torch lights, and with praises, and from thence\nhe returned with his army into Phenicia.","Three years afterwards Jason sent Menelaus, brother of the\naforesaid Simon, to carry money to the king, and to bring answers from\nhim concerning certain necessary affairs.","But he being recommended to the king, when he had magnified the\nappearance of his power, got the high priesthood for himself, by\noffering more than Jason by three hundred talents of silver.","So having received the king's mandate, he returned, bringing\nnothing worthy of the high priesthood:  but having the mind of a cruel\ntyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.","Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, being himself\nundermined, was driven out a fugitive into the country of the\nAmmonites.","So Menelaus got the principality:  but as for the money he had\npromised to the king, he took no care, when Sostratus, the governor of\nthe castle, called for it.","For to him appertained the gathering of the taxes:  wherefore they\nwere both called before the king.","And Menelaus was removed from the priesthood, Lysimachus, his\nbrother, succeeding:  and Sostratus alas made governor of the Cyprians.","When these things were in doing, it fell out that they of\nTharsus, and Mallos, raised a sedition, because they were given for a\ngift to Antiochus, the king's concubine.","The king, therefore, went in all haste to appease them, leaving\nAndronicus, one of his nobles, for his deputy.","Then Menelaus supposing that he had found a convenient time,\nhaving stolen certain vessels of gold out of the temple, gave them to\nAndronicus, and others he had sold at Tyre, and in the neighbouring\ncities:","Which when Onias understood most certainly, he reproved him,\nkeeping himself in a safe place at Antioch, beside Daphne.","Whereupon Menelaus coming to Andronicus, desired him to kill\nOnias.  And he went to Onias, and gave him his right hand with an oath,\nand (though he were suspected by him) persuaded him to come forth out\nof the sanctuary, and immediately slew him, without any regard to\njustice.","For which cause not only the Jews, but also the other nations,\nconceived indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of\nso great a man.","And when the king was come back from the places of Cilicia, the\nJews that were at Antioch, and also the Greeks, went to him:\ncomplaining of the unjust murder of Onias.","Antiochus, therefore, was grieved in his mind for Onias, and\nbeing moved to pity, shed tears, remembering the sobriety and modesty\nof the deceased.","And being inflamed to anger, he commanded Andronicus to be\nstripped of his purple, and to be led about through all the city:  and\nthat in the same place wherein he had committed the impiety against\nOnias, the sacrilegious wretch should be put to death, the Lord\nrepaying him his deserved punishment.","Now when many sacrileges had been committed by Lysimachus in the\ntemple, by the counsel of Menelaus, and the rumour of it was spread\nabroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus,\na great quantity of gold being already carried away.","Wherefore the multitude making an insurrection, and their minds\nbeing filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and\nbegan to use violence, one Tyrannus being captain, a man far gone both\nin age and in madness.","But when they perceived the attempt of Lysimachus, some caught up\nstones, some strong clubs, and some threw ashes upon Lysimachus.","And many of them were wounded, and some struck down to the\nground, but all were put to flight:  and as for the sacrilegious fellow\nhimself, they slew him beside the treasury.","Now concerning these matters, an accusation was laid against\nMenelaus.","And when the king was come to Tyre, three men were sent from the\nancients to plead the cause before him.","But Menelaus being convicted, promised Ptolemee to give him much\nmoney to persuade the king to favour him.","So Ptolemee went to the king in a certain court where he was, as\nit were to cool himself, and brought him to be of another mind:","So Menelaus, who was guilty of all the evil, was acquitted by him\nof the accusations:  and those poor men, who, if they had pleaded their\ncause even before Scythians, should have been judged innocent, were\ncondemned to death.","Thus they that persecuted the cause for the city, and for the\npeople, and the sacred vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.","Wherefore even the Tyrians, being moved with indignation, were\nvery liberal towards their burial.","And so through the covetousness of them that were in power,\nMenelaus continued in authority, increasing in malice to the betraying\nof the citizens."]}
