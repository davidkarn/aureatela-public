{"verses":["Therefore, when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and\nthe laws as yet were very well kept, because of the godliness of Onias,\nthe high priest and the hatred his soul had of evil,","It came to pass that even the kings themselves and the princes\nesteemed the place worthy of the highest honour, and glorified the\ntemple with very great gifts:","So that Seleucus, king of Asia, allowed out of his revenues all\nthe charges belonging to the ministry of the sacrifices.","But one Simon, of the tribe of Benjamin, who was appointed\noverseer of the temple, strove in opposition to the high priest, to\nbring about some unjust thing in the city.","And when he could not overcome Onias, he went to Apollonius, the\nson of Tharseas, who at that time was governor of Celesyria, and\nPhenicia:","And told him, that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of immense\nsums of money, and the common store was infinite, which did not belong\nto the account of the sacrifices:  and that it was possible to bring all\ninto the king's hands.","Now when Apollonius had given the king notice concerning the money\nthat he was told of, he called for Heliodorus, who had the charge over\nhis affairs, and sent him with commission to bring him the foresaid\nmoney.","So Heliodorus forthwith began his journey, under a colour of\nvisiting the cities of Celesyria and Phenicia, but indeed to fulfil the\nking's purpose.","And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously\nreceived in the city by the high priest, he told him what information\nhad been given concerning the money:  and declared the cause for which\nhe was come:  and asked if these things were so indeed.","Then the high priest told him that these were sums deposited, and\nprovisions for the subsistence of the widows and the fatherless:","And that some part of that which wicked Simon had given\nintelligence of belonged to Hircanus, son of Tobias, a man of great\ndignity; and that the whole was four hundred talents of silver, and two\nhundred of gold.","But that to deceive them who had trusted to the place and temple\nwhich is honoured throughout the whole world, for the reverence and\nholiness of it, was a thing which could not by any means be done.","But he, by reason of the orders he had received from the king,\nsaid, that by all means the money must be carried to the king.","So on the day he had appointed, Heliodorus entered in to order\nthis matter.  But there was no small terror throughout the whole city.","And the priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their\npriests' vestments, and called upon him from heaven, who made the law\nconcerning things given to be kept, that he would preserve them safe,\nfor them that had deposited them.","Now whosoever saw the countenance of the high priest, was wounded\nin heart:  for his face, and the changing of his colour, declared the\ninward sorrow of his mind.","For the man was so compassed with sadness and horror of the body,\nthat it was manifest to them that beheld him, what sorrow he had in his\nheart.","Others also came flocking together out of their houses, praying\nand making public supplication, because the place was like to come into\ncontempt.","And the women, girded with haircloth about their breasts, came\ntogether in the streets.  And the virgins also that were shut up, came\nforth, some to Onias, and some to the walls, and others looked out of\nthe windows.","And all holding up their hands towards heaven made supplication.","For the expectation of the mixed multitude, and of the high\npriest, who was in an agony, would have moved any one to pity.","And these indeed called upon almighty God, to preserve the things\nthat had been committed to them safe and sure for those that had\ncommitted them.","But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on, himself\nbeing present in the same place with his guard about the treasury.","But the spirit of the Almighty God gave a great evidence of his\npresence, so that all that had presumed to obey him, falling down by\nthe power of God, were struck with fainting and dread.","For there appeared to them a horse, with a terrible rider upon\nhim, adorned with a very rich covering:  and he ran fiercely and struck\nHeliodorus with his fore feet, and he that sat upon him seemed to have\narmour of gold.","Moreover there appeared two other young men, beautiful and\nstrong, bright and glorious, and in comely apparel:  who stood by him,\non either side, and scourged him without ceasing with many stripes.","And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they took him up,\ncovered with great darkness, and having put him into a litter, they\ncarried him out.","So he that came with many servants, and all his guard, into the\naforesaid treasury, was carried out, no one being able to help him, the\nmanifest power of God being known.","And he indeed, by the power of God, lay speechless, and without\nall hope of recovery.","But they praised the Lord, because he had glorified his place:\nand the temple, that a little before was full of fear and trouble, when\nthe Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness.","Then some of the friends of Heliodorus forthwith begged of Onias,\nthat he would call upon the Most High to grant him his life, who was\nready to give up the ghost.","So the high priest, considering that the king might perhaps\nsuspect that some mischief had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews,\noffered a sacrifice of health for the recovery of the man.","And when the high priest was praying, the same young men in the\nsame clothing stood by Heliodorus, and said to him:  Give thanks to\nOnias the priest:  because for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life.","And thou having been scourged by God, declare unto all men the\ngreat works and the power of God.  And having spoken thus, they appeared\nno more.","So Heliodorus, after he had offered a sacrifice to God, and made\ngreat vows to him, that had granted him life, and given thanks to\nOnias, taking his troops with him, returned to the king.","And he testified to all men the works of the great God, which he\nhad seen with his own eyes.","And when the king asked Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be\nsent yet once more to Jerusalem, he said:","If thou hast any enemy, or traitor to thy king dom, send him\nthither, and thou shalt receive him again scourged, if so be he escape:\nfor there is undoubtedly in that place a certain power of God.","For he that hath his dwelling in the heavens, is the visitor and\nprotector of that place, and he striketh and destroyeth them that come\nto do evil to it.","And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the\ntreasury, fell out in this manner."]}
