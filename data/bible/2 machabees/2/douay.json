{"verses":["And how he gave them the law, that they should not forget the\ncommandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds,\nseeing the idols of gold, and silver, and the ornaments of them.","And with other such like speeches, he exhorted them that they\nwould not remove the law from their heart.","It was also contained in the same writing, how the prophet, being\nwarned by God, commanded that the tabernacle and the ark should\naccompany him, till he came forth to the mountain where Moses went up,\nand saw the inheritance of God.","And when Jeremias came thither he found a hollow cave:  and he\ncarried in thither the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of\nincense, and so stopped the door.","Then some of them that followed him, came up to mark the place:\nbut they could not find it.","And when Jeremias perceived it, he blamed them, saying:  The place\nshall be unknown, till God gather together the congregation of the\npeople, and receive them to mercy.","And then the Lord will shew these things, and the majesty of the\nLord shall appear, and there shall be a cloud as it was also shewed to\nMoses, and he shewed it when Solomon prayed that the place might be\nsanctified to the great God.","For he treated wisdom in a magnificent manner:  and like a wise\nman, he offered the sacrifice of the dedication, and of the finishing\nof the temple.","And as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven,\nand consumed the holocaust:  so Solomon also prayed, and fire came down\nfrom heaven and consumed the holocaust.","And Moses said:  Because the sin offering was not eaten, it was\nconsumed.","So Solomon also celebrated the dedication eight days.","And these same things were set down in the memoirs, and\ncommentaries of Nehemias:  and how he made a library, and gathered\ntogether out of the countries, the books both of the prophets, and of\nDavid, and the epistles of the kings, and concerning the holy gifts.","And in like manner Judas also gathered together all such things\nas were lost by the war we had, and they are in our possession.","Wherefore, if you want these things, send some that may fetch\nthem to you.","As we are then about to celebrate the purification, we have\nwritten unto you:  and you shall do well, if you keep the same days.","And we hope that God, who hath delivered his people, and hath\nrendered to all the inheritance, and the kingdom, and the priesthood,\nand the sanctuary,","As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and\nwill gather us together from every land under heaven into the holy\nplace.","For he hath delivered us out of great perils, and hath cleansed\nthe place.","Now as concerning Judas Machabeus, and his brethren, and the\npurification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar:","As also the wars against Antiochus, the Illustrious, and his son,\nEupator:","And the manifestations that came from heaven to them, that\nbehaved themselves manfully on the behalf of the Jews, so that, being\nbut a few they made themselves masters of the whole country, and put to\nflight the barbarous multitude:","And recovered again the most renowned temple in all the world,\nand delivered the city, and restored the laws that were abolished, the\nLord with all clemency shewing mercy to them.","And all such things as have been comprised in five books by\nJason, of Cyrene, we have attempted to abridge in one book.","For considering the multitude of books, and the difficulty that\nthey find that desire to undertake the narrations of histories, because\nof the multitude of the matter,","We have taken care for those indeed that are willing to read,\nthat it might be a pleasure of mind:  and for the studious, that they\nmay more easily commit to memory:  and that all that read might receive\nprofit.","And as to ourselves indeed, in undertaking this work of\nabridging, we have taken in hand no easy task; yea, rather a business\nfull of watching and sweat.","But as they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of\nothers:  for the sake of many, we willingly undergo the labour.","Leaving to the authors the exact handling of every particular,\nand as for ourselves, according to the plan proposed, studying to be\nbrief.","For as the master builder of a new house must have care of the\nwhole building:  but he that taketh care to paint it, must seek out fit\nthings for the adorning of it:  so must it be judged of us.","For to collect all that is to be known, to put the discourse in\norder, and curiously to discuss every particular point, is the duty of\nthe author of a history:","But to pursue brevity of speech, and to avoid nice declarations\nof things, is to be granted to him that maketh an abridgment.","Here then we will begin the narration:  let this be enough by way\nof a preface:  for it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to\nbe short in the story itself."]}
