{"verses":["But when Nicanor understood that Judas was in the places of\nSamaria, he purposed to set upon him with all violence, on the sabbath\nday.","And when the Jews that were constrained to follow him, said:  Do\nnot act so fiercely and barbarously, but give honour to the day that is\nsanctified:  and reverence him that beholdeth all things:","That unhappy man asked, if there were a mighty One in heaven,\nthat had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.","And when they answered:  There is the living Lord himself in\nheaven, the mighty One, that commanded the seventh day to be kept.","Then he said:  And I am mighty upon the earth, and I command to\ntake arms, and to do the king's business.  Nevertheless he prevailed not\nto accomplish his design.","So Nicanor being puffed up with exceeding great pride, thought to\nset up a public monument of his victory over Judas.","But Machabeus ever trusted with all hope that God would help\nthem.","And he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the nations,\nbut to remember the help they had before received from heaven, and now\nto hope for victory from the Almighty.","And speaking to them out of the law, and the prophets, and withal\nputting them in mind of the battles they had fought before, he made\nthem more cheerful:","Then after he had encouraged them, he shewed withal the\nfalsehood of the Gentiles, and their breach of oaths.","So he armed every one of them, not with defence of shield and\nspear, but with very good speeches, and exhortations, and told them a\ndream worthy to be believed, whereby he rejoiced them all.","Now the vision was in this manner.  Onias, who had been high\npriest, a good and virtuous man, modest in his looks, gentle in his\nmanners, and graceful in speech, and who from a child was exercised in\nvirtues holding up his hands, prayed for all the people of the Jews:","After this there appeared also another man, admirable for age,\nand glory, and environed with great beauty and majesty:","Then Onias answering, said:  This is a lover of his brethren, and\nof the people of Israel:  this is he that prayeth much for the people,\nand for all the holy city, Jeremias, the prophet of God.","Whereupon Jeremias stretched forth his right hand, and gave to\nJudas a sword of gold, saying:","Take this holy sword, a gift from God, wherewith thou shalt\noverthrow the adversaries of my people Israel.","Thus being exhorted with the words of Judas, which were very\ngood, and proper to stir up the courage, and strengthen the hearts of\nthe young men, they resolved to fight, and to set upon them manfully:\nthat valour might decide the matter, because the holy city, and the\ntemple were in danger.","For their concern was less for their wives, and children, and\nfor their brethren, and kinsfolks:  but their greatest and principal\nfear was for the holiness of the temple.","And they also that were in the city, had no little concern for\nthem that were to be engaged in battle.","And now when all expected what judgment would be given, and the\nenemies were at hand, and the army was set in array, the beasts and the\nhorsemen ranged in convenient places,","Machabeus considering the coming of the multitude, and the\ndivers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts,\nstretching out his hands to heaven, called upon the Lord, that worketh\nwonders, who giveth victory to them that are worthy, not according to\nthe power of their arms, but according as it seemeth good to him.","And in his prayer he said after this manner:  Thou, O Lord, who\ndidst send thy angel in the time of Ezechias, king of Juda, and didst\nkill a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of Sennacherib:","Send now also, O Lord of heaven, thy good angel before us, for\nthe fear and dread of the greatness of thy arm,","That they may be afraid, who come with blasphemy against thy\nholy people.  And thus he concluded his prayer.","But Nicanor, and they that were with him came forward, with\ntrumpets and songs.","But Judas, and they that were with him, encountered them,\ncalling upon God by prayers:","So fighting with their hands, but praying to the Lord with their\nhearts, they slew no less than five and thirty thousand, being greatly\ncheered with the presence of God.","And when the battle was over, and they were returning with joy,\nthey understood that Nicanor was slain in his armour.","Then making a shout, and a great noise, they blessed the\nAlmighty Lord in their own language.","And Judas, who was altogether ready, in body and mind, to die\nfor his countrymen, commanded that Nicanor's head, and his hand, with\nthe shoulder, should be cut off, and carried to Jerusalem.","And when he was come thither, having called together his\ncountrymen, and the priests to the altar, he sent also for them that\nwere in the castle,","And shewing them the head of Nicanor, and the wicked hand, which\nhe had stretched out, with proud boasts, against the holy house of the\nAlmighty God,","He commanded also, that the tongue of the wicked Nicanor should\nbe cut out, and given by pieces to birds, and the hand of the furious\nman to be hanged up over against the temple.","Then all blessed the Lord of heaven, saying:  Blessed be he that\nhath kept his own place undefiled.","And he hung up Nicanor's head in the top of the castle, that it\nmight be an evident and manifest sign of the help of God.","And they all ordained by a common decree, by no means to let\nthis day pass without solemnity:","But to celebrate the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, called\nin the Syrian language, the day before Mardochias' day.","So these things being done with relation to Nicanor, and from\nthat time the city being possessed by the Hebrews, I also will here\nmake an end of my narration.","Which if I have done well, and as it becometh the history, it is\nwhat I desired:  but if not so perfectly, it must be pardoned me.","For as it is hurtful to drink always wine, or always water, but\npleasant to use sometimes the one, and sometimes the other:  so if the\nspeech be always nicely framed, it will not be grateful to the readers.\nBut here it shall be ended."]}
