{"verses":["To the brethren, the Jews that are throughout Egypt; the brethren,\nthe Jews that are in Jerusalem, and in the land of Judea, send health\nand good peace.","May God be gracious to you, and remember his covenant that he made\nwith Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants:","And give you all a heart to worship him, and to do his will with a\ngreat heart, and a willing mind.","May he open your heart in his law, and in his commandments, and\nsend you peace.","May he hear your prayers, and be reconciled unto you, and never\nforsake you in the evil time.","And now here we are praying for you.","When Demetrius reigned, in the year one hundred and sixty-nine, we\nJews wrote to you in the trouble and violence that came upon us in\nthose years, after Jason withdrew himself from the holy land, and from\nthe kingdom.","They burnt the gate, and shed innocent blood:  then we prayed to\nthe Lord, and were heard, and we offered sacrifices, and fine flour,\nand lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.","And now celebrate ye the days of Scenopegia in the month of\nCasleu.","In the year one hundred and eighty-eight, the people that is at\nJerusalem, and in Judea, and the senate, and Judas, to Aristobolus, the\npreceptor of king Ptolemee, who is of the stock of the anointed\npriests, and to the Jews that are in Egypt, health and welfare.","Having been delivered by God out of great dangers, we give him\ngreat thanks, forasmuch as we have been in war with such a king.","For he made numbers of men swarm out of Persia, that have fought\nagainst us, and the holy city.","For when the leader himself was in Persia, and with him a very\ngreat army, he fell in the temple of Nanea, being deceived by the\ncounsel of the priests of Nanea.","For Antiochus, with his friends, came to the place as though he\nwould marry her, and that he might receive great sums of money under\nthe title of a dowry.","And when the priests of Nanea had set it forth, and he with a\nsmall company had entered into the compass of the temple, they shut the\ntemple,","When Antiochus was come in:  and opening a secret entrance of the\ntemple, they cast stones and slew the leader, and them that were with\nhim, and hewed them in pieces; and cutting off their heads, they threw\nthem forth.","Blessed be God in all things, who hath delivered up the wicked.","Therefore, whereas we purpose to keep the purification of the\ntemple on the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu, we thought\nit necessary to signify it to you:  that you also may keep the day of\nScenopegia, and the day of the fire, that was given when Nehemias\noffered sacrifice, after the temple and the altar was built.","For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that then\nwere worshippers of God, took privately the fire from the altar, and\nhid it in a valley where there was a deep pit without water, and there\nthey kept it safe, so that the place was unknown to all men.","But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemias\nshould be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of\nthose priests that had hid it, to seek for the fire:  and as they told\nus, they found no fire, but thick water.","Then he bade them draw it up, and bring it to him:  and the\npriest, Nehemias, commanded the sacrifices that were laid on, to be\nsprinkled with the same water, both the wood, and the things that were\nlaid upon it.","And when this was done, and the time came that the sun shone out,\nwhich before was in a cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that\nall wondered.","And all the priests made prayer, while the sacrifice was\nconsuming, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering.","And the prayer of Nehemias was after this manner:  O Lord God,\nCreator of all things, dreadful and strong, just and merciful, who\nalone art the good king,","Who alone art gracious, who alone art just, and almighty, and\neternal, who deliverest Israel from all evil, who didst choose the\nfathers, and didst sanctify them:","Receive the sacrifice for all thy people Israel, and preserve thy\nown portion, and sanctify it.","Gather together our scattered people, deliver them that are\nslaves to the Gentiles, and look upon them that are despised and\nabhorred:  that the Gentiles may know that thou art our God","Punish them that oppress us, and that treat us injuriously with\npride.","Establish thy people in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken.","And the priests sung hymns till the sacrifice was consumed.","And when the sacrifice was consumed, Nehemias commanded the water\nthat was left to be poured out upon the great stones.","Which being done, there was kindled a flame from them:  but it was\nconsumed by the light that shined from the altar.","And when this matter became public, it was told to the king of\nPersia, that in the place where the priests that were led away, had hid\nthe fire, there appeared water, with which Nehemias and they that were\nwith him had purified the sacrifices.","And the king considering, and diligently examining the matter,\nmade a temple for it, that he might prove what had happened.","And when he had proved it, he gave the priests many goods, and\ndivers presents, and he took and distributed them to them with his own\nhand.","And Nehemias called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted\npurification.  But many call it Nephi."]}
