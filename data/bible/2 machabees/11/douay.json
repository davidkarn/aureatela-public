{"verses":["A short time after this Lysias, the king's lieutenant, and\ncousin, and who had chief charge over all the affairs, being greatly\ndispleased with what had happened,","Gathered together fourscore thousand men, and all the horsemen,\nand came against the Jews, thinking to take the city, and make it a\nhabitation of the Gentiles:","And to make a gain of the temple, as of the other temples of the\nGentiles and to set the high priesthood to sale every year:","Never considering the power of God, but puffed up in mind, and\ntrusting in the multitude of his foot soldiers, and the thousands of\nhis horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.","So he came into Judea, and approaching to Bethsura, which was in\na narrow place, the space of five furlongs from Jerusalem, he laid\nsiege to that fortress.","But when Machabeus, and they that were with him, understood that\nthe strong holds were besieged, they and all the people besought the\nLord with lamentations and tears, that he would send a good angel to\nsave Israel.","Then Machabeus himself first taking his arms, exhorted the rest\nto expose themselves together with him, to the danger, and to succour\ntheir brethren.","And when they were going forth together with a willing mind,\nthere appeared at Jerusalem a horseman going before them in white\nclothing, with golden armour, shaking a spear.","Then they all together blessed the merciful Lord, and took great\ncourage:  being ready to break through not only men, but also the\nfiercest beasts, and walls of iron.","So they went on courageously, having a helper from heaven, and\nthe Lord, who shewed mercy to them.","And rushing violently upon the enemy, like lions, they slew of\nthem eleven thousand footmen, and one thousand six hundred horsemen:","And put all the rest to flight; and many of them being wounded,\nescaped naked:  Yea, and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and\nescaped.","And as he was a man of understanding, considering with himself\nthe loss he had suffered, and perceiving that the Hebrews could not be\novercome, because they relied upon the help of the Almighty God, he\nsent to them:","And promised that he would agree to all things that are just,\nand that he would persuade the king to be their friend.","Then Machabeus consented to the request of Lysias, providing for\nthe common good in all things; and whatsoever Machabeus wrote to\nLysias, concerning the Jews, the king allowed of.","For there were letters written to the Jews from Lysias, to this\neffect:  Lysias, to the people of the Jews, greeting.","John, and Abesalom, who were sent from you, delivering your\nwritings, requested that I would accomplish those things which were\nsignified by them.","Therefore whatsoever things could be reported to the king,\nI have represented to him:  and he hath granted as much as the matter\npermitted.","If, therefore, you will keep yourselves loyal in affairs,\nhereafter also I will endeavour to be a means of your good.","But as concerning other particulars, I have given orders by word\nboth to these, and to them that are sent by me, to commune with you.","Fare ye well.  In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the four\nand twentieth day of the month of Dioscorus.","But the king's letter contained these words King Antiochus to\nLysias, his brother, greeting.","Our father being translated amongst the gods we are desirous\nthat they that are in our realm should live quietly, and apply\nthemselves diligently to their own concerns.","And we have heard that the Jews would not consent to my father\nto turn to the rites of the Greeks but that they would keep to their\nown manner of living and therefore that they request us to allow them\nto live after their own laws.","Wherefore being desirous that this nation also should be at\nrest, we have ordained and decreed, that the temple should be restored\nto them, and that they may live according to the custom of their\nancestors.","Thou shalt do well, therefore, to send to them, and grant them\npeace, that our pleasure being known, they may be of good comfort, and\nlook to their own affairs.","But the king's letter to the Jews was in this manner:  King\nAntiochus to the senate of the Jews, and to the rest of the Jews,\ngreeting.","If you are well, you are as we desire:  we ourselves also are\nwell.","Menelaus came to us, saying that you desired to come down to\nyour countrymen, that are with us.","We grant, therefore, a safe conduct to all that come and go,\nuntil the thirtieth day of the month of Xanthicus,","That the Jews may use their own kind of meats, and their own\nlaws, as before:  and that none of them any manner of ways be molested\nfor things which have been done by ignorance.","And we have sent also Menelaus to speak to you.","Fare ye well.  In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the\nfifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.","The Romans also sent them a letter, to this effect:  Quintus\nMemmius, and Titus Manilius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people\nof the Jews, greeting.","Whatsoever Lysias, the king's cousin, hath granted to you, we\nalso have granted.","But touching such things as he thought should be referred to the\nking, after you have diligently conferred among yourselves, send some\none forthwith, that we may decree as it is convenient for you:  for we\nare going to Antioch.","And therefore make haste to write back, that we may know of what\nmind you are.","Fare ye well.  In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the\nfifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus."]}
