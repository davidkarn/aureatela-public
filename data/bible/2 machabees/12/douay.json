{"verses":["When these covenants were made, Lysias went to the king, and the\nJews gave themselves to husbandry.","But they that were behind, viz.  Timotheus, and Apollonius, the\nson of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and besides them\nNicanor, the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to live in\npeace, and to be quiet.","The men of Joppe also were guilty of this kind of wickedness:\nthey desired the Jews, who dwelt among them, to go with their wives and\nchildren into the boats, which they had prepared, as though they had no\nenmity to them.","Which when they had consented to, according to the common decree\nof the city, suspecting nothing, because of the peace:  when they were\ngone forth into the deep, they drowned no fewer than two hundred of\nthem.","But as soon as Judas heard of this cruelty done to his\ncountrymen, he commanded the men that were with him:  and after having\ncalled upon God, the just judge,","He came against those murderers of his brethren, and set the\nhaven on fire in the night, burnt the boats, and slew with the sword\nthem that escaped from the fire.","And when he had done these things in this manner, he departed as\nif he would return again, and root out all the Joppites.","But when he understood that the men of Jamnia also designed to do\nin like manner to the Jews that dwelt among them,","He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set the haven on\nfire, with the ships, so that the light of the fire was seen at\nJerusalem, two hundred and forty furlongs off.","And when they were now gone from thence nine furlongs, and were\nmarching towards Timotheus, five thousand footmen, and five hundred\nhorsemen of the Arabians, set upon them.","And after a hard fight, in which, by the help of God, they got\nthe victory, the rest of the Arabians being overcome, besought Judas\nfor peace, promising to give him pastures, and to assist him in other\nthings.","And Judas thinking that they might be profitable indeed in many\nthings, promised them peace, and after having joined hands, they\ndeparted to their tents.","He also laid siege to a certain strong city, encompassed with\nbridges and walls, and inhabited by multitudes of different nations,\nthe name of which is Casphin.","But they that were within it, trusting in the strength of the\nwalls, and the provision of victuals, behaved in a more negligent\nmanner, and provoked Judas with railing and blaspheming, and uttering\nsuch words as were not to be spoken.","But Machabeus calling upon the great Lord of the world, who\nwithout any rams or engines of war threw down the walls of Jericho, in\nthe time of Josue, fiercely assaulted the walls.","And having taken the city by the will of the Lord, he made an\nunspeakable slaughter, so that a pool adjoining, of two furlongs broad,\nseemed to run with the blood of the slain.","From thence they departed seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and\ncame to Characa, to the Jews that are called Tubianites.","But as for Timotheus, they found him not in those places, for\nbefore he had dispatched any thing he went back, having left a very\nstrong garrison in a certain hold:","But Dositheus, and Sosipater, who were captains with Machabeus,\nslew them that were left by Timotheus in the hold, to the number of ten\nthousand men.","And Machabeus having set in order about him six thousand men,\nand divided them by bands, went forth against Timotheus, who had with\nhim a hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and two thousand five\nhundred horsemen.","Now when Timotheus had knowledge of the coming of Judas, he sent\nthe women and children, and the other baggage, before him into a\nfortress, called Carnion:  for it was impregnable, and hard to come at,\nby reason of the straitness of the places.","But when the first band of Judas came in sight, the enemies were\nstruck with fear, by the presence of God, who seeth all things, and\nthey were put to flight one from another, so that they were often\nthrown down by their own companions, and wounded with the strokes of\ntheir own swords.","But Judas pursued them close, punishing the profane, of whom he\nslew thirty thousand men.","And Timotheus himself fell into the hands of the band of\nDositheus and Sosipater, and with many prayers he besought them to let\nhim go with his life, because he had the parents and brethren of many\nof the Jews, who, by his death, might happen to be deceived.","And when he had given his faith that he would restore them\naccording to the agreement, they let him go without hurt, for the\nsaving of their brethren.","Then Judas went away to Carnion, where he slew five and twenty\nthousand persons.","And after he had put to flight and destroyed these, he removed\nhis army to Ephron, a strong city, wherein there dwelt a multitude of\ndivers nations:  and stout young men standing upon the walls, made a\nvigorous resistance:  and in this place there were many engines of war,\nand a provision of darts.","But when they had invocated the Almighty, who with his power\nbreaketh the strength of the enemies, they took the city:  and slew five\nand twenty thousand of them that were within.","From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six\nhundred furlongs from Jerusalem.","But the Jews that were among the Scythopolitans testifying that\nthey were used kindly by them, and that even in the times of their\nadversity they had treated them with humanity:","They gave them thanks, exhorting them to be still friendly to\ntheir nation, and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks\nbeing at hand.","And after Pentecost they marched against Gorgias, the governor\nof Idumea.","And he came out with three thousand footmen and four hundred\nhorsemen.","And when they had joined battle, it happened that a few of the\nJews were slain.","But Dositheus, a horseman, one of Bacenor's band, a valiant man,\ntook hold of Gorgias:  and when he would have taken him alive, a certain\nhorseman of the Thracians came upon him, and cut off his shoulder:  and\nso Gorgias escaped to Maresa.","But when they that were with Esdrin had fought long, and were\nweary, Judas called upon the Lord to be their helper, and leader of the\nbattle:","Then beginning in his own language, and singing hymns with a\nloud voice, he put Gorgias's soldiers to flight.","So Judas having gathered together his army, came into the city\nOdollam:  and when the seventh day came, they purified themselves\naccording to the custom, and kept the sabbath in the same place.","And the day following Judas came with his company, to take away\nthe bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their\nkinsmen, in the sepulchres of their fathers.","And they found under the coats of the slain, some of the\ndonaries of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbiddeth to the Jews:\nso that all plainly saw, that for this cause they were slain.","Then they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord, who had\ndiscovered the things that were hidden.","And so betaking themselves to prayers, they besought him, that\nthe sin which had been committed might be forgotten.  But the most\nvaliant Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin,\nforasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had happened, because of\nthe sins of those that were slain.","And making a gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachms of\nsilver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the\ndead, thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection.","(For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise\nagain, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead,)","And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with\ngodliness, had great grace laid up for them.","It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the\ndead, that they may be loosed from sins."]}
