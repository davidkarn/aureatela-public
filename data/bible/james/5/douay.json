{"verses":["Go to now, ye rich men:  weep and howl in your miseries, which\nshall come upon you.","Your riches are corrupted:  and your garments are motheaten.","Your gold and silver is cankered:  and the rust of them shall be\nfor a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire.  You\nhave stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.","Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields,\nwhich by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth:  and the cry of them\nhath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.","You have feasted upon earth:  and in riotousness you have nourished\nyour hearts, in the day of slaughter.","You have condemned and put to death the Just One:  and he resisted\nyou not.","Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord.\nBehold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth:\npatiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.","Be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts:  for the\ncoming of the Lord is at hand.","Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be\njudged.  Behold the judge standeth before the door.","Take, my brethren, for example of suffering evil, of labour and\npatience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.","Behold, we account them blessed who have endured.
