And even now they have added to their sins lusts and iniquitous pollutions, and thus their iniquities have, been filled up. But make known[fn-2-P271_37096:6-nf] these words to all your children, and to your wife, who is to be your sister. For she does not[fn-2-P272_37283:7-nf] restrain her tongue, with which she commits iniquity; but, on hearing these words, she will control herself, and will obtain mercy. For after you have made known to them these words which my Lord has commanded me to reveal to you,[fn-2-P273_37568:8-nf] then shall they be forgiven all the sins which in former times they committed, and forgiveness will be granted to all the saints who have sinned even to the present day, if they repent with all their heart, and drive all doubts from their minds.[fn-2-P274_37956:9-nf] For the Lord has sworn by His glory, in regard to His elect, that if any one of them sin after a certain day which has been fixed, he shall not be saved.

Pray, my dear father, warn this man not to hold language contrary to his profession, and not to undo with his words the chastity which he professes by his garb. Whether he elects to be a virgin or a married celibate-and the choice must rest with himself-he must not compare wives with virgins, for that would be to have striven in vain against Jovinian's eloquence. He likes, I am told, to visit the cells of widows and virgins, and to lecture them with his brows knit on sacred literature. What is it that he teaches these poor women in the privacy of their own chambers? Is it to feel assured that virgins are no better than wives? Is it to make the most of the flower of their age, to eat and drink, to frequent the baths, to live in luxury, and not to disdain the use of perfumes? Or does he preach to them chastity, fasting, and neglect of their persons? No doubt the precepts that he inculcates are full of virtue. But if so, let him admit publicly what he says privately. Or, if his private teaching is the same as his public, he should keep aloof altogether from the society of girls. He is a young man-a monk, and in his own eyes an eloquent one (do not pearls fall from his lips, and are not his elegant phrases sprinkled with comic salt and humor?)-I am surprised, therefore, that he can without a blush frequent noblemen's houses, pay constant visits to married ladies, make our religion a subject of contention, distort the faith of Christ by misapplying words, and-in addition to all this-detract from one who is his brother in the Lord. He may, however, have supposed me to be in error (for \"in many things we offend all,\" and \"if any man offend not in word he is a perfect man\"[fn-17-P1751_418647:1217-nf] ). In that case he should have written to convict me or to question me, the course taken by Pammachius, a man of high attainments and position.

That secular and church writers should have adopted this line need not surprise us when we consider that the translators of the Septuagint,[fn-23-P2351_597144:1672-nf] the evangelists, and the apostles, have done the same in dealing with the sacred writings. We read in Mark[fn-23-P2352_597290:1673-nf] of the Lord saying Talitha cumi and it is immediately added \"which is interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.\" The evangelist may he charged with falsehood for having added the words \"I say unto thee\" for the Hebrew is only \"Damsel arise.\" To emphasize this and to give the impression of one calling and commanding he has added \"I say unto thee.\" Again in Matthew[fn-23-P2353_597680:1674-nf] when the thirty pieces of silver are returned by the traitor Judas and the potter's field is purchased with them, it is written:-\"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken of by Jeremy the prophet, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued which[fn-23-P2354_598013:1675-nf] they of the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.\" This passage is not found in Jeremiah at all but in Zechariah, in quite different words and an altogether different order. In fact the Vulgate renders it as follows:-\"And I will say unto them, If it is good in your sight, give ye me a price or refuse it: So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Put them into the melting furnace and consider if it is tried as I have been tried by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the Lord.\"[fn-23-P2355_598663:1676-nf] It is evident that the rendering of the Septuagint differs widely from the quotation of the evangelist. In the Hebrew also, though the sense is the same, the words are quite different and differently arranged. It says: \"And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and, if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter;[fn-23-P2356_599102:1677-nf] a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.\"[fn-23-P2357_599262:1678-nf] They may accuse the apostle of falsifying his version seeing that it agrees neither with the Hebrew nor with the translators of the Septuagint: and worse than this, they may say that he has mistaken the author's name putting down Jeremiah when it should be Zechariah. Far be it from us to speak thus of a follower[fn-23-P2358_599617:1679-nf] of Christ, who made it his care to formulate dogmas rather than to hunt for words and syllables. To take another instance from Zechariah, the evangelist John quotes from the Hebrew, \"They shall look on him whom they pierced,\"[fn-23-P2359_599865:1680-nf] for which we read in the Septuagint, \"And they shall look upon me because they have mocked me,\" and in the Latin version, \"And they shall look upon me for the things which they have mocked or insulted.\" Here the evangelist, the Septuagint, and our own version[fn-23-P2360_600163:1681-nf] all differ; yet the divergence of language is atoned by oneness of spirit. In Matthew again we read of the Lord preaching flight to the apostles and confirming His counsel with a passage from Zechariah. \"It is written,\" he says, \"I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.\"[fn-23-P2361_600583:1682-nf] But in the Septuagint and in the Hebrew it reads differently, for it is not God who speaks, as the evangelist makes out, but the prophet who appeals to God the Father saying:-\"Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.\" In this instance according to my judgment-and I have some careful critics with me-the evangelist is guilty of a fault in presuming to ascribe to God what are the words of the prophet. Again the same evangelist writes that at the warning of an angel Joseph took the young child and his mother and went into Egypt and remained there till the death of Herod; \"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\"[fn-23-P2362_601326:1683-nf] The Latin manuscripts do not so give the passage, but in Hosea[fn-23-P2363_601415:1684-nf] the true Hebrew text has the following:-\"When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.\" Which the Septuagint renders thus:-\"When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called his sons out of Egypt.\" Are they[fn-23-P2364_601674:1685-nf] altogether to be rejected because they have given another turn to a passage which refers primarily to the mystery of Christ? Or should we not rather pardon the shortcomings of the translators on the score of their human frailty according to the saying of James, \"In many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body.\"[fn-23-P2365_602116:1686-nf] Once more it is written in the pages of the same evangelist, \"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.\"[fn-23-P2366_602343:1687-nf] Let these word fanciers and nice critics of all composition tell us where they have read the words; and if they cannot, let me tell them that they are in Isaiah.[fn-23-P2367_602529:1688-nf] For in the place where we read and translate, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots,\"[fn-23-P2368_602695:1689-nf] in the Hebrew idiom it is written thus, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse and a Nazarene shall grow from his root.\" How can the Septuagint leave out the word `Nazarene,' if it is unlawful to substitute one word for another? It is sacrilege either to conceal or to set at naught a mystery.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1377","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"10. In the gospel the Saviour commends the unjust steward because, although he defrauded his master, he acted wisely for his own interests.[fn-49-P4988_1371933:3560-nf] The heretics in this instance pursued the same course; for, seeing how great a matter a little fire had kindled,[fn-49-P4989_1372068:3561-nf] and that the flames applied by them to the foundations had by this time reached the housetops, and that the deception practised on many could no longer be hid, they asked for and obtained letters of commendation from the church,[fn-49-P4990_1372320:3562-nf] so that it might appear that till the day of their departure they had continued in full communion with it. Shortly afterwards[fn-49-P4991_1372560:3563-nf] the distinguished Anastasius succeeded to the pontificate; but he was soon taken away, for it was not fitting that the head of the world should be struck off[fn-49-P4992_1372736:3564-nf] during the episcopate of one so great. He was removed, no doubt, that he might not seek to turn away by his prayers the sentence of God passed once for all. For the words of the Lord to Jeremiah concerning Israel applied equally to Rome: \"pray not for this people for their good. When they fast I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and oblation, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence.\"[fn-49-P4993_1373280:3565-nf] You will say, what has this to do with the praises of Marcella? I reply, She it was who originated the condemnation of the heretics. She it was who furnished witnesses first taught by them and then carried away by their heretical teaching. She it was who showed how large a number they had deceived and who brought up against them the impious books brOn First Principles, books which were passing from hand to hand after being `improved' by the hand of the scorpion.[fn-49-P4994_1373784:3566-nf] She it was lastly who called on the heretics in letter after letter to appear in their own defence. They did not indeed venture to come, for they were so conscience-stricken that they let the case go against them by default rather than face their accusers and be convicted by them. This glorious victory originated with Marcella, she was the source and cause of this great blessing. You who shared the honour with her know that I speak the truth. You know too that out of many incidents I only mention a few, not to tire out the reader by a wearisome recapitulation. Were I to say more, ill natured persons might fancy me, under pretext of commending a woman's virtues, to be giving vent to my own rancour.

It never entered his mind, however, along with this conceit, to venture to affirm that children of men are born without original sin. If, indeed, he had added such an opinion, the women might have more readily consented to marry, to give birth to such pure offspring. When this man's writings (for he dared to write) were by the brethren forwarded to Jerome to refute, he not only discovered no such error in them, but, while looking out his conceits for refutation, he found among other passages this very clear testimony to the doctrine of man's original sin, from which Jerome indeed felt satisfied of the man's belief of that doctrine.[fn-11-P1183_616709:28-nf] These are his words when treating of it: \"He who says that he abides in Christ, ought himself also to walk even as He walked.[fn-11-P1184_616900:29-nf] We give our opponent the option to choose which alternative he likes. Does he abide in Christ, or does he not? If he does, then, let him walk like Christ. If, however, it is a rash thing to undertake to resemble the excellences of Christ, he abides not in Christ, because he walks not as Christ did. He did no sin, neither was any guile found in His mouth;[fn-11-P1185_617274:30-nf] who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He opened not His mouth;[fn-11-P1186_617408:31-nf] to whom the prince of this world came, and found nothing in Him;[fn-11-P1187_617492:32-nf] whom, though He had done no sin, God made sin for us.[fn-11-P1188_617565:33-nf] We, however, according to the Epistle of James, all commit many sins;[fn-11-P1189_617654:34-nf] and none of us is pure from uncleanness, even if his life should be but of one day.[fn-11-P1190_617756:35-nf] For who shall boast that he has a clean heart?

The life of man is full of examples of this. But whence comes it that we fall short of knowing what is pleasing to Him, if it be not that He is to that extent unknown to us? \"For now we see through aglass, darkly; but then face to face.\"[fn-18-P1827_799511:376-nf] Who, however, can make so bold, on arriving far enough, to say: \"Then shall I know even as also I am known,\"[fn-18-P1828_799644:377-nf] as to think that they who shall see God will have no greater love towards Him than they have who now believe in Him? or that the one ought to be compared to the other, as if they were very near to each other? Now, if love increases just in proportion as our knowledge of its object becomes more intimate, of course we ought to believe that there is as much wanting now to the fulfilment of righteousness as there is defective in our love of it. A thing may indeed be known or believed, and yet not loved; but it is an impossibility that a thing can be loved which is neither known nor believed. But if the saints, in the exercise of their faith, could arrive at that great love, than which (as the Lord Himself testified) no greater can possibly be exhibited in the present life,-even to lay down their lives for the faith, or for their brethren,[fn-18-P1829_800515:378-nf] -then after their pilgrimage here, in which their walk is by \"faith,\" when they shall have reached the \"sight\" of that final happiness[fn-18-P1830_800670:379-nf] which we hope for, though as yet we see it not, and wait for in patience,[fn-18-P1831_800764:380-nf] then undoubtedly love itself shall be not only greater than that which we here experience, but far higher than all which we ask or think;[fn-18-P1832_800924:381-nf] and yet it cannot be possibly more than \"with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind.\" For there remains in us nothing which can be added to the whole; since, if anything did remain, there would not be the whole. Therefore the first commandment about righteousness, which bids us love the Lord with all our heart, and soul, and mind[fn-18-P1833_801299:382-nf] (the next to which is, that we love our neighbour as ourselves), we shall completely fulfil in that life when we shall see face to face.[fn-18-P1834_801459:383-nf] But even now this commandment is enjoined upon us, that we may be reminded what we ought by faith to require, and what we should in our hope look forward to, and, \"forgetting the things which are behind, reach forth to the things which are before.\"[fn-18-P1835_801732:384-nf] And thus, as it appears to me, that man has made a far advance, even in the present life, in the righteousness which is to be perfected hereafter, who has discovered by this very advance how very far removed he is from the completion of righteousness.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_11_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2. This would be a real difficulty and one for ever incapable of solution were it not solved by the witness of John himself, who immediately goes on to say,[fn-65-P6593_2064420:4-nf] \"My little children, guard yourselves from idols.\" If everyone that is born of God sinneth not, and cannot be tempted by the devil, how is it that he bids them beware of temptation? Again in the same Epistle we read:[fn-65-P6594_2064654:5-nf] \"If we say that we have no sins, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.\" I suppose that John was baptized and was writing to the baptized: I imagine too that all sin is of the devil. Now John confesses himself a sinner, and hopes for forgiveness of sins after baptism. My friend Jovinianus says,[fn-65-P6595_2065178:6-nf] \"Touch me not, for I am clean.\" What then? Does the Apostle contradict himself? By no means. In the same passage he gives his reason for thus speaking:[fn-65-P6596_2065429:7-nf] \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. And hereby know we that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby know we that we are in him: he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" My reason for telling you, little children, that everyone who is born of God sinneth not, is that you may not sin, and that you may know that so long as you sin not I you abide in the birth which God has given you. Yea, they who abide in that birth cannot sin.[fn-65-P6597_2066320:8-nf] \"For what communion hath light with darkness? Or Christ with Belial?\" As day is distinct from night, so righteousness and unrighteousness, sin and good works, Christ and Antichrist cannot blend. If we give Christ a lodging-place in our hearts, we banish the devil from thence. If we sin and the devil enter through the gate of sin, Christ will immediately withdraw. Hence David after sinning says:[fn-65-P6598_2066751:9-nf] \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,\" that is, the joy which he had lost by sinning.[fn-65-P6599_2066858:10-nf] \"He who saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" Christ is called the truth:[fn-66-P6600_2067007:11-nf] \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" In vain do we make our boast in him whose commandments we keep not. To him that knoweth what is good, and doeth it not, it is sin.[fn-66-P6601_2067199:12-nf] \"As the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.\" And we must not think it a great matter to know the only God, when even devils believe and tremble. \"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" Our opponent may choose whichever of the two he likes; we give him his choice. Does he abide in Christ, or not? If he abide, let him then walk as Christ walked. But if there is[fn-66-P6602_2067660:13-nf] rashness in professing to copy the virtues of our Lord, he does not abide in Christ, for he does not walk as did Christ.[fn-66-P6603_2068078:14-nf] \"He did not sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again, and as a lamb is dumb before its shearer, so opened he not his mouth.\" To Him came the prince of this world, and found nothing in Him: although He had done no sin, God made Him sin for us. But we, according to the Epistle of James,[fn-66-P6604_2068429:15-nf] \"all stumble in many things,\" and[fn-66-P6605_2068482:16-nf] \"no one is pure from sin, no not if his life be but a day long.\"[fn-66-P6606_2068582:17-nf] For who will boast \"that he has a clean heart? or who will be sure that he is pure from sin?\" And we are held guilty after the similitude of Adam's transgression. Hence David says,[fn-66-P6607_2068781:18-nf] \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" And the blessed Job,[fn-66-P6608_2068892:19-nf] \"Though I be righteous my mouth will speak wickedness, and though I be perfect, I shall be found perverse. If I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean, yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me.\" But that we may not utterly despair and think that if we sin after baptism we cannot be saved, he immediately checks the tendency:[fn-66-P6609_2069307:20-nf] \"And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins. And not for ours only, but also for the whole world.\" He addresses this to baptized believers, and he promises them the Lord as an advocate for their offences. He does not say: If you fall into sin, you have an advocate with the Father, Christ, and He is the propitiation for your sins: you might then say that he was addressing those whose baptism had been destitute of the true faith: but what he says is this, \"We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, and he is the propitiation for our sins.\" And not only for the sins of John and his contemporaries, but for those of the whole world. Now in \"the whole world\" are included apostles and all the faithful, and a clear proof is established that sin after baptism is possible. It is useless for us to have an advocate Jesus Christ, if sin be impossible.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"If we are simply wise according to the Scriptures, we are not compelled to dispute against the grace of Christ, and to make statements attempting to show that human nature both requires no Physician,-in infants, because it is whole and sound; and in adults, because it is able to suffice for itself in attaining righteousness, if it will.

As if in a reproachful tone, which would say: You are able to tame wild beasts; cannot you tame the tongue?

Will any one, then, dare to divorce it from the grace of God, and with most arrogant vanity place it in the power of man? Why should I pray to God that it be accorded me, if it may be had of man? Ought we not to object to this prayer lest injury be done to free will which is self-sufficient in the possibility of nature for discharging all the duties of righteousness? We ought, then, to object also to the Apostle James himself, who admonishes us in these words: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him; but let him ask in faith, nothing doubting.\"[fn-19-P1984_842857:43-nf] This is the faith to which the commandments drive us, in order that the law may prescribe our duty and faith accomplish it.[fn-19-P1985_843000:44-nf] For through the tongue, which no man can tame, but only the wisdom which comes down from above, \"in many things we all of us offend.\"[fn-19-P1986_843173:45-nf] For this truth also the same apostle pronounced in no other sense than that in which he afterwards declares: \"The tongue no man can tame.\"[fn-19-P1987_843330:46-nf] ","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"143","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Whosoever, then, supposes that any man or any men (except the one Mediator between God and man[fn-27-P2763_1072805:233-nf] ) have ever lived, or are yet living in this present state, who have not needed, and do not need, forgiveness of sins, he opposes Holy Scripture, wherein it is said by the apostle: \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in which all have sinned.\"[fn-27-P2764_1073126:234-nf] And he must needs go on to assert, with an impious contention, that there may possibly be men who are freed and saved from sin without the liberation and salvation of the one Mediator Christ. Whereas He it is who has said: \"They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick;\"[fn-27-P2765_1073435:235-nf] \"I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"[fn-27-P2766_1073522:236-nf] He, moreover, who says that any man, after he has received remission of sins, has ever lived in this body, or still is living, so righteously as to have no sin at all, he contradicts the Apostle John, who declares that \"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-27-P2767_1073840:237-nf] Observe, the expression is not we had, but \"we have.\" If, however, anybody contend that the apostle's statement concerns the sin which dwells in our mortal flesh according to the defect which was caused by the will of the first man when he sinned, and concerning which the Apostle Paul enjoins us \"not\" to \"obey it in the lusts thereof,[fn-27-P2768_1074197:238-nf] -so that he does not sin who altogether withholds his consent from this same indwelling sin, and so brings it to no evil work,-either in deed, or word, or thought,-although the lusting after it may be excited (which in another sense has received the name of sin, inasmuch as consenting to it would amount to sinning), but excited against our will,-he certainly is drawing subtle distinctions, and should consider what relation all this bears to the Lord's Prayer, wherein we say, \"Forgive us our debts.\"[fn-27-P2769_1074721:239-nf] Now, if I judge aright, it would be unnecessary to put up such a prayer as this, if we never in the least degree consented to the lusts of the before-mentioned sin, either in a slip of the tongue, or in a wanton thought; all that it would be needful to say would be, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\"[fn-27-P2770_1075066:240-nf] Nor could the Apostle James say: \"In many things we all offend.\"[fn-27-P2771_1075152:241-nf] For in truth only that man offends whom an evil concupiscence persuades, either by deception or by force, to do or say or think something which he ought to avoid, by directing his appetites or his aversions contrary to the rule of righteousness. Finally, if it be asserted that there either have been, or are in this present life, any persons, with the sole exception of our Great Head, \"the Saviour of His body,\"[fn-27-P2772_1075586:242-nf] who are righteous, without any sin,-and this, either by not consenting to the lusts thereof, or because that must not be accounted as any sin which is such that God does not impute it to them by reason of their godly lives (although the blessedness of being without sin is a different thing from the blessedness of not having one's sin imputed to him),[fn-27-P2773_1075973:243-nf] -I do not deem it necessary to contest the point over much.

But if any man says that we ought not to use the prayer, \"Lead us not into temptation\" (and he says as much who maintains that God's help is unnecessary to a person for the avoidance of sin, and that human will, after accepting only the law, is sufficient for the purpose), then I do not hesitate at once to affirm that such a man ought to be removed from the public ear, and to be anathematized by every mouth.

If any one, for example, were to allege that eaglets are suspended in the talons of the parent bird, and so exposed to the rays of the sun, and such as wink are flung to the ground as spurious, the light being in some mysterious way the gauge of their genuine nature, he is not to be accounted a heretic, if the story happens to be untrue.[fn-28-P2898_1123058:43-nf] And, since it occurs in the writings of the learned and is very commonly received as fact, ought it to be considered a foolish thing to mention it, even though it be not true? much less ought our credit, which gains for us the name of being trustworthy, to be affected, on the one hand injuriously if the story be believed by us, or beneficially if disbelieved.[fn-28-P2899_1123503:44-nf] If, to go a step further in illustration, any one were from this opinion to contend that there existed in birds reasonable souls, from the notion that human souls at intervals passed into them, then indeed we should have to reject from our mind and ears alike an idea like this as the rankest heresy; and even if the story about the eagles were true (as there are many curious facts about bees before our eyes, that are true), we should still have to consider, and demonstrate, the great difference that exists between the condition of creatures like these, which are quite irrational, however surprising in their powers of sensation, and the nature which is common (not to men and beasts, but) to men and angels. There are, to be sure, a great many foolish things said by foolish and ignorant persons, which yet fail to prove them heretics. One might instance the silly talk so commonly heard about the pursuits of other people, from persons who have never learned these pursuits,-equally hasty and untenable whether in the shape of excessive and indiscriminate praise of those they love, or of blame in the case of those they happen to dislike. The same remark might be made concerning the usual curent of human conversation: whenever it does touch on a subject which requires dogmatic acuracy of statement, but is thrown out at random or suggested by the passing moment, it is too often pervaded by foolish levity, whether uttered by the mouth or expressed in writing. Many persons, indeed, when gently reminded of their reckless gossip, have afterwards much regretted their conduct; they scarcely recollected what they had never uttered with a fixed purpose, but had poured forth in a sheer volley of casual and unconsidered words. It is, unhappily, almost impossible to be quite clear of such faults. Who is he \"that slippeth not in his tongue,\"[fn-29-P2900_1125472:45-nf] and \"offendeth not in word?\"[fn-29-P2901_1125527:46-nf] It, however, makes all the difference in the world, to what extent, and from what motive, and whether in fact at all, a man when warned of his fault corrects it, or obstinately clings to it so as to make a dogma and settled opinion of that which he had not at first uttered on purpose, but only in levity. Although, then, it turns out eventually that every heretic is a fool, it does not follow that every fool must immediately be named a heretic. The judges were quite right in saying that Pelagius had anathematized the vague folly under consideration by its fitting designation for even if it were heresy, there could be no doubt of its being foolish prattle. Whatever, therefore, it was, they designated the offence under a general name. But whether the quoted words had been used with any definitely dogmatic purpose, or only in a vague and indeterminate sense, and with an unmeaningness which should be capable of an easy correction, they did not deem it necessary to discuss on the present occasion, since the man who was on his trial before them denied that the words were his at all, in whatever sense they had been employed.","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_17_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"14. From this swelling pride springs the audacity in prayer which marks the directions in your letter to a[fn-78-P7864_2546537:58-nf] certain widow as to how the saints ought to pray. \"He,\" you say,[fn-78-P7865_2546846:59-nf] \"rightly lifts up his hands to God; he pours out supplications with a good conscience who can say, `Thou knowest, Lord, how holy, how innocent, how pure from all deceit, wrong, and robbery are the hands which I spread out unto Thee; how righteous, how spotless, and free from all falsehood are the lips with which I pour forth my prayers unto Thee, that Thou mayest pity me.'\" Is this the prayer of a Christian, or of a proud Pharisee like him who[fn-78-P7866_2547743:60-nf] says in the Gospel, \"God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, robbers, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican: I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\" Yet he merely thanks God because, by His mercy, he is not as other men: he execrates sin, and does not claim his righteousness as his own. But you say, \"Now Thou knowest how holy, how innocent, how pure from all deceit, wrong, and robbery are the hands which I spread out before Thee.\" He says that he fasts twice in the week, that he may afflict his vicious and wanton flesh, and he gives tithes of all his substance. For[fn-78-P7867_2548381:61-nf] \"the ransom of a man's life is his riches.\" You join the devil in boasting,[fn-78-P7868_2548477:62-nf] \"I will ascend above the stars, I will place my throne in heaven, and I will be like the Most High.\" David says,[fn-78-P7869_2548652:63-nf] \"My loins are filled with illusions\"; and[fn-78-P7870_2548721:64-nf] \"My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness\"; and[fn-78-P7871_2548800:65-nf] \"Enter not into judgment with Thy servant\"; and[fn-78-P7872_2548868:66-nf] \"In Thy sight no man living shall be justified.\" You boast that you are holy, innocent, and pure, and spread out clean hands unto God. And you are not satisfied with glorying in all your works, unless you say that you are pure from all sins of speech; and you tell us how righteous, how spotless, how free from all falsehood your lips are. The Psalmist sings,[fn-78-P7873_2549242:67-nf] \"Every man is a liar\"; and this is supported by apostolical authority: \"That God may be true,\" says St. Paul,[fn-78-P7874_2549371:68-nf] \"and every man a liar\"; and yet you have lips righteous, spotless, and free from all falsehood. Isaiah laments, saying,[fn-78-P7875_2549509:69-nf] \"Woe is me! for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips\"; and afterwards one of the seraphim brings a hot coal, taken with the tongs, to purify the prophet's lips, for he was not, according to the tenor of your words, arrogant, but he confessed his own faults. Just as we read in the Psalms,[fn-78-P7876_2549879:70-nf] \"What shall be due unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee in respect of a deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that make desolate.\" And after all this swelling with pride, and boastfulness in prayer, and confidence in your holiness, like one fool trying to persuade another, you finish with the words \"These lips with which I pour out my supplication that Thou mayest have pity on me.\" If you are holy, if you are innocent, if you are cleansed from all defilement, if you have sinned neither in word nor deed-although James says,[fn-78-P7877_2550462:71-nf] \"He who offends not in word is a perfect man,\" and \"No one can curb his tongue\"-how is it that you sue for mercy? so that, forsooth, you bewail yourself, and pour out prayers because you are holy, pure, and innocent, a man of stainless lips, free from all falsehood, and endowed with a power like that of God. Christ prayed thus on the cross:[fn-78-P7878_2550824:72-nf] \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?

Cleanse thy head from all defilement, because it is a disgrace that it, after the sanctifying oil has been applied to it, should be polluted with the juice or powder of either crocus, or any other pigment, or should be adorned with gold or gems or any other earthly ornament, because it already shines with the radiance of heavenly adornment. It is undoubtedly a grave insult to Divine grace to prefer to it any mundane and worldly ornament. And next, cleanse thy forehead, that it may blush at human, and not at Divine works, and may display that shame which gives rise not to sin, but to the favor of God, as the sacred Scripture declares, \"There is a shame that causes sin, and there is a shame that brings with it the favor[fn-7-P787_318061:26-nf] of God.\" Cleanse, too, thy neck, that it may not carry thy[fn-7-P788_318252:27-nf] locks in a golden net and necklaces hung round it, but may rather bear about it those ornaments of which the Scripture says, \"Let not[fn-7-P789_318405:28-nf] mercy and faith depart from thee,\" and hang them upon thy heart as upon thy neck. Cleanse thine eyes, whilst thou dost withdraw them from all concupiscence, and dost never turn them away from the sight of the poor, and dost keep them from all dyes, in that purity in which they were made by God. Cleanse thy tongue from falsehood, because \"a mouth[fn-7-P790_318771:29-nf] which tells lies destroys the soul\": cleanse it from detraction, from swearing, and from perjury. I beg you not to think it is an inverted order that I have said the tongue should be cleansed from swearing before perjury, for one will then the more easily escape perjury, if he swears not at all, so that there may be fulfilled in him that statement, \"Keep[fn-7-P791_319148:30-nf] thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\" And be mindful of the Apostle who says, \"Bless, and[fn-7-P792_319276:31-nf] curse not.\" But often call to mind the following words, \"See that no one render evil for evil to any man, or cursing for cursing, but on the contrary, do ye bless them, because to this ye have been called, that ye should possess a blessing[fn-7-P793_319552:32-nf] by inheritance\"; and this other passage, \"If any[fn-7-P794_319620:33-nf] one offend not in tongue, he is a perfect man.\" For it is shameful that those lips, by which you confess God, pray to him, bless him, and praise him, should be defiled by the pollution of any sin. I know not with what conscience any one can pray to God with that tongue with which he either speaks falsehood, or calumniates, or detracts. God listens to holy lips, and speedily answers those prayers which an unpolluted tongue pours forth. Cleanse also thine ears, so that they may not listen except to holy and true discourse, that they never admit into them obscene, or infamous, or worldly words, or tolerate any one detracting from another, on account of that which is written, \"Hedge up[fn-7-P795_320334:34-nf] thine ears with thorns, and do not listen to a wicked tongue, that you may have your part with him, of whom it is said, that he was[fn-7-P796_320485:35-nf] righteous in hearing and seeing; i.e. he sinned neither with his eyes nor his ears. Cleanse, too, thy hands, \"that they n be not stretched out to receive, but shut against giving,\" and that they[fn-7-P797_320700:36-nf] be not prompt to strike, but ever ready for all the works of mercy and piety. In fine, cleanse thy feet, that they follow not the broad and ample way which leads to grand and costly worldly banquets, but that they tread rather the difficult and narrow path, which guides to heaven, for it is written, \"Make a[fn-7-P798_321028:37-nf] straight path for your feet.\" Acknowledge that your members were formed for you by God the Maker, not for vices, but for virtues; and, when you have cleansed the whole of your limbs from every stain of sin, and they have become sanctified throughout your whole body, then understand that this purity will profit you, and look forward with all confidence to the prize of virginity.","title":"Letter II.

But what did they actually do? Consider what it was and ask yourself whether the crime is not unexampled? Recall the passage which says: \"But perhaps you will ask me my opinion as to the Only-begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even to him the nature of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible, do not dismiss my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for I will at once give you my reason for it.\" Well, in the place of the words which I had written, \"I will at once give you my reason for it\" they put the following words: \"Do not dismiss my, answer as if it were impious or absurd, for, as the Son does not see the Father, so the Holy Spirit also does not see the Son.\" If the man who did this, the man who was sent from their monastery[fn-86-P8674_2184179:36-nf] to Rome as the greatest expert in calumny, had been employed in the forum and had committed this forgery in some secular business every one knows what would be the consequence to him according to the public laws, when he was convicted of the crime. But now, since he has left the secular life, and has turned his back upon business and entered a monastery, and has connected himself with a renowned master, he has learned from him to leave his former self-restraint and to become a furious madman: he was quiet before, now he is a mover of sedition: he was peaceable, now he provokes war: instead of concord, he is the promoter of strife. For faith he has learnt perfidiousness, for truth forgery. He would, you may well think, have been the complete exemplar of wickedness and criminality of this kind, if you had not had before you the image of that woman Jezebel.[fn-86-P8675_2185217:37-nf] She is the same who made up the accusation against Naboth the Zezreelite for the sake of the vineyard, and sent word to the wicked eiders to urge against him a false indictment, saying that he had blessed, that is cursed, God and the king. I know not whether of the two is to be accounted the happier, she who sends the command or they who obey it in all its iniquity. These matters are serious; such a crime, as far as I know, is hitherto all but unheard of in the Church. Yet there is something more to be said. What is that you ask. It is this, that those who are guilty should become the judges, that those who plotted the accusation should also pronounce the sentence. It is, indeed, no new thing for a writer to make a mistake or a slip in his words, and in my opinion it is a venial fault, for the Scripture also says,[fn-86-P8676_2186123:38-nf] \"In many things we all stumble: if any stumbleth not in word the same is a perfect man.\" Is it thought that some word is wrong? Then let it he corrected or amended, or, if expediency so require, let it be taken out. But to insert in what another man has written things he never wrote, to put in false words for no other purpose than to defame your brother, to corrupt his writings in order to attach a mark of infamy to the author, and to insinuate your ideas into the ears of the multitude so as to throw confusion into the minds of the simple; and all this with the object of staining a maws reputation among his fellows; I ask you whose work this can be except that of him who was a liar from the beginning, and who, from accusing the brethren, received the name of Diabolus, which means accuser. For when he to whom I have alluded[fn-86-P8677_2186977:39-nf] recited at Milan one of these sentences which had been tampered with, and I cried out that what he was reading was falsified, he, being asked from whom he had received the copy of the work said that a certain woman named Marcella had given it him. As to her, I say nothing, whosoever she may be. I leave her to her own conscience and to God. I am content with God's own witness and with yours. When I say yours, I mean your own and that of Macarius himself, the saintly man for whom I was doing that work: for both of you read my papers themselves at the first, even before they had been completed, and you have by you the completely corrected copies. You can bear witness to what I say. The words \"as the Son does not see the Father, so also the Holy Spirit does not see the Son\" not only were never written by me, but on the contrary I can point out the forger by whom they were written. If any man says that as the Father does not see the Son, so the Son does not see the Father or that the Holy Spirit does not see the Father and the Son as the Father sees the Son and the Son and the Holy Spirit, let him be anathema. For he sees, and sees most truly; only, as God sees God and the Light sees the Light; not as flesh sees flesh, but as the Holy Spirit sees, not with the bodily senses, but by the powers of the Deity. I say, if any one denies this let him be anathema for all eternity.

I will follow the order of your letter, and subjoin your very words as you spoke them. \"I admit, that, as you say, I praised, your eloquence in my Preface; and I would praise it again now were it not that contrary to the advice of your Tully, you make it hateful by excessive boastfulness.\" Where have I boasted of my eloquence? I did not even accept willingly the praise which you bestowed on it. Perhaps your reason for saying this is that you do not wish, yourself, to be flattered by public praise given in guile. Rest assured you shall be accused openly; you reject one who would praise you; you shall have experience of out who openly arraigns you. I was not so foolish as to criticize your illiterate style; no one can expose it to condemnation so strongly as you do whenever you write. I only wished to show your fellow-disciples who shared your lack of literary training what progress you had made during your thirty years in the East, an illiterate writer, who takes impudence for eloquence, and universal evil speaking a sign of a good conscience. I am not going to administer the ferule; I do not assume, as you put it, to apply the strokes of the leather thong to teach an aged pupil his letters. But the fact is your eloquence and teaching is so sparkling that we mere tract-writers cannot bear it, and you dazzle our eyes with the acuteness of your talents to such an extent that we must all seem to be envious of you; and we must really join in the attempt to suppress you, for, if once you obtain the primacy among us as a writer, and stand on the summit of the rhetorical arch, all of us who profess to know anything will not be allowed to mutter a word. I am, according to you, a philosopher and an orator, grammarian, dialectician, one who knows Hebrew, Greek and Latin, a `trilingual' man. On this estimate, you also will be `bilingual,' who know enough Latin and Greek to make the Greek think you a Latin scholar and the Latin a Greek: and the bishop Epiphanius will be a `pentaglossic[fn-94-P9439_2588897:23-nf] man' since he speaks in five languages against you and your favorite.[fn-94-P9440_2588986:24-nf] But I wonder at the rashness which made you dare to say to one so accomplished as you profess to think me: \"You, whose accomplishments give you so many watchful eyes, how can you be pardoned if you go wrong? How can you fail to be buried in the silence of a never ending shame?\" When I read this, and reflected that I must somewhere or other have made a slip in my words (for[fn-94-P9441_2589404:25-nf] \"if any man does not go wrong in word, the same is a perfect man\") and was expecting that he was about to expose some of my faults; all of a sudden I came upon the words: \"Two days before the carrier of this letter set out your declamation against me was put into my hands.\" What became then of those threats of yours, and of your words: \"How can you be pardoned if you go wrong? How Call you fail to be covered with the silence of a never ending shame?\" Yet perhaps, notwithstanding the shortness of the time, you were able to put this in order; or else you were intending to hire in one of the learned sort, who would expect to find in my works the ornaments and gems of an eloquence like yours. You wrote before this: \"Accept the document which I send which you wished to buy at a great price;\" but now you speak with the pretence of humility. \"I intended to follow your example; but, since the messenger who was returning to yon was hurrying back again I thought it better to write shortly to you than at greater length to others.\" In the meantime you boldly take pleasure in your illiteracy. Indeed you once confessed it, declaring that `it was superfluous to notice a few faults of style, when it was acknowledged that there were faults in every part.' I will not therefore find fault with you for putting down that a document was acquired when you meant that it was bought; though acquiring is said of things like in kind, whereas buying implies the counting out of money: nor for such a sentence as \"as he who was returning to you was hurrying hack again\" which is a redundancy worthy of the poorest style of diction. I will only reply to the arguments, and will convict you, not of solaecisms and barbarisms, but of falsehood, cunning and impudence.","title":"Book III.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_54_the_passion_of_the_holy_martyrs_perpetua_and_felicitas_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-03","text":"3. \"And we went forth, and saw before the entrance Optatus the bishop at the right hand, and Aspasius the presbyter, a teacher,[fn-121-P12155_3397924:27-nf] at the left hand, separate and sad; and they cast themselves at our feet, and said to us, `Restore peace between us, because you have gone forth and have left us thus.'

Howbeit. since your reproach flows not from the muddy torrent of arrogance. but from the pure fountain of love, I will unfold to you the secret of this mystery. Very often when I wish to draw near to that seat, I see a virtue as it were sitting upon it, exceeding radiant with the brightness of its light. Then, being in suspense between joy and fear, I acknowledge that I am altogether unworthy to sit upon such a seat, and if I did not hesitate to cause an occasion of offence to the people, without doubt I should not even venture to sit upon the stool itself. Thus it is, my beloved sons, that I seem to you, in this, to, transgress the pontifical rule.[fn-43-P4306_1286373:35-nf] Nevertheless, many times when I see it vacant, as ye yourselves are witnesses, I refuse not to sit upon the chair after the accustomed manner. Wherefore do ye, now that ye are acquainted with my secret, and being well assured that, if I shall be indulged, I will sit upon the chair, for I hold not in slight esteem the dignity of my order, cease any further from joining in the exclamations of the populace.\" This explanation the most holy father whilst he was yet alive, was compelled to give to the clergy. The faithful of Christ, therefore, remembering all this with pious devotion, brought his sacred body, and caused it to sit upon the episcopal throne. As much joy and exultation arose then to heaven from the people, as if they were attending him alive and in the body. Then embalming him with sweet spices, they wrapped him in silken coverings; what each one of them could be the first to bring, this he accounted to himself as greatest gain. Then carrying palms, the tokens of victory, with flaming tapers, with sounding hymns, and with fragrant incense, celebrating the triumph of his heavenly victory, they laid down the sacred relics, and buried them in the cemetery which had been long ago constructed by him, where too from henceforth, and even to this day, miraculous virtues cease not to show themselves. Pious vows, forsooth, are received with a propitious hearing; the health of the impotent is restored; the expulsion of unclean spirits testifies to the martyr's merits. These gifts, O Lord Jesus, are Thine, whose wont it is thus magnificently to honour Thy martyrs after death: Thou who with the Father and the Holy Consubstantial Spirit livest and reignest for evermore. Amen. After this, how that wolf and framer of treachery, that is Arius, covered with a sheep's skin, entered into the Lord's fold to worry and torment it, or in what manner he was enabled to attain to the dignity of the priesthood, let us employ ourselves in relating in brief,[fn-43-P4307_1288377:36-nf] And this not to annoy those who ventured to recall to the threshing-floor of the Lord those tares of apostacy and contagion that had been winnowed out of the Church by a heavenly fan i for these are without doubt reckoned eminent for sanctity, but thinking it a light thing to believe so holy a a man, they transgressed the injunctions of the divine command. What then? Do we reprehend them? By no means, For as long as this corruptible body weighs s down, and this earthly habitation depresses the sense of our infirmity, many are easily deceived in their imaginations, and think that which is unjust to be just, that to be holy which is impure. The Gibeonites who, by the divine threatenings, were to be utterly destroyed, having one thing in their wishes and another in their voice and mien, were able quickly to deceive Joshua,[fn-43-P4308_1289282:37-nf] that just distributor of the land of promise. David[fn-43-P4309_1289354:38-nf] also, full of prophetic inspiration, when he had heard the words of the deceitful youth, although it was by the inscrutable and just judgment of God, yet acted very differently from what the true nature of the case required. What also can be more sublime than the apostles, who have not removed themselves from our infirmity? For one of them writes, \"In many things we offend all; \"[fn-43-P4310_1289820:39-nf] and another, \"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-43-P4311_1289929:40-nf] But when we repent of these, so much the more readily do we obtain pardon, when we have sinned not willingly, but through ignorance or frailty. And certainly offences of this sort come not of prevarication, but of the indulgence of compassion. But I leave to others to write an apology for this; let us pursue what is in hand. After that magnificent defender of the faith, Peter, worthy of his name, had by the triumph of martyrdom, etc.","title":"The Genuine Acts of Peter.","author":"Peter, Bishop of Alexandria"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_217_sermon_lxxxviii_on_the_fast_of_the_seventh_month_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"To this unconquerable strength of unity, therefore, dearly-beloved, we are even now invited by the solemn Fast of the Seventh Month, that we may lift our souls to the Lord free from worldly cares and earthly concerns. And because, always needful as this endeavour is, we cannot all adhere to it perpetually, and often through human frailty we fall back from higher things to the things of earth, let us at least on these days, which are most healthfully ordained for our correction, withdraw ourselves from worldly occupations, and steal a little time for promoting our eternal welfare. \"For in many things,\" as it is written, \"we all stumble[fn-41-P4128_1058409:5-nf] .\" And though by the daily gift of God[fn-41-P4129_1058468:6-nf] we be cleansed from divers pollutions, yet there cling to unwary souls for the most part darker stains, which need a greater care to wash them out, a stronger effort to destroy them. And the fullest abolition of sins is obtained when the whole Church offers up one prayer and one confession. For if the Lord has promised fulfilment of all they shall ask, to the holy and devout agreement of two or three, what shall be denied to many thousands of the people who unite in one act of worship, and with one breath make their common supplications[fn-41-P4130_1059135:7-nf] ?","title":"Sermon LXXXVIII.
