But in her despair she lost her composure, and looking back became a monument of an unbelieving soul.[fn-44-P4407_1200148:3117-nf] Yet, as if to make up for the loss of a single woman, Lot's glowing faith set free the whole city of Zoar. In fact when he left the dark valleys in which Sodom lay and came to the mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City; so-called because the little faith that Lot possessed, though unable to save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones. For one who had gone so far astray as to live in Gomorrah could not all at once reach the noonland where Abraham, the friend of God,[fn-44-P4408_1200697:3118-nf] entertained God and His angels.[fn-44-P4409_1200751:3119-nf] (For it was in Egypt that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the Bridegroom her cry is: \"tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon.\"[fn-44-P4410_1200957:3120-nf] ) Good men have always sorrowed for the sins of others. Samuel of old lamented for Saul[fn-44-P4411_1201066:3121-nf] because he neglected to treat the ulcers of pride with the balm of penitence. And Paul wept for the Corinthians[fn-44-P4412_1201202:3122-nf] who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and without song, and lamentation and woe;[fn-44-P4413_1201409:3123-nf] the song in praise of the righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of whom it is written, \"When the wicked man falleth into the depths of evil, then is he filled with scorn.\"[fn-44-P4414_1201639:3124-nf] It is to these that Isaiah alludes when he says: \"in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh\" and saying, \"let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"[fn-44-P4415_1201969:3125-nf] Yet of such persons Ezekiel is bidden to speak thus: \"O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,\" and again, \"turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"[fn-44-P4416_1202467:3126-nf] Nothing makes God so angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, \"withhold thy foot from a rough way and thy throat from thirst\"[fn-44-P4417_1202936:3127-nf] and again \"shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?\"[fn-44-P4418_1203043:3128-nf] Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: \"When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shall thou be saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.\"[fn-44-P4419_1203233:3129-nf] We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. \"Repent,\" he cries, \"and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4420_1203902:3130-nf] Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\"[fn-44-P4421_1204103:3131-nf] These words shew us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, \"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,\"[fn-44-P4422_1204647:3132-nf] and again, \"Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.\"[fn-44-P4423_1204792:3133-nf] He means to say, \"when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue, God strengthened my weakness with His grace.\" Lo, I hear. His promise: \"I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,\"[fn-44-P4424_1205067:3134-nf] so that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid hold of by thine hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my wickedness is consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest foods.[fn-44-P4425_1205388:3135-nf] He it was who hedged up and enclosed my evil ways[fn-44-P4426_1205461:3136-nf] that I might find Him the true way who says in the gospel, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\"[fn-44-P4427_1205582:3137-nf] Hear the words of the prophet: \"they that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\"[fn-44-P4428_1205809:3138-nf] Say also with him: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears\"[fn-44-P4429_1205935:3139-nf] : and again, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-44-P4430_1206182:3140-nf] and in another place, \"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-44-P4431_1206420:3141-nf] For although my soul has thirsted after thee, yet much more have I sought thee by the labour of my flesh and have not been able to look upon thee in thy sanctuary; not at any rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of sin, where the weary wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no pools or rivers of lust.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now these people imagine that they are acute (as if none among us knew it) when they say, that \"if we have not the will, we commit no sin; nor would God command man to do what was impossible for human volition.\" But they do not see, that in order to overcome certain things, which are the objects either of an evil desire or an ill-conceived fear, men need the strenuous efforts, and sometimes even all the energies, of the will; and that we should only imperfectly employ these in every instance, He foresaw who willed so true an utterance to be spoken by the prophet: \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified.\"[fn-7-P737_467527:3-nf] The Lord, therefore, foreseeing that such would be our character, was pleased to provide and endow with efficacious virtue certain healthful remedies against the guilt and bonds even of sins committed after baptism,-for instance, the works of mercy,-as when he says: \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you.\"[fn-7-P738_467887:4-nf] For who could quit this life with any hope ofobtaining eternal salvation, with that sentence impending: \"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,\"[fn-7-P739_468099:5-nf] if there did not soon after follow: \"So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty: for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment?\"[fn-7-P740_468335:6-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now these people imagine that they are acute (as if none among us knew it) when they say, that \"if we have not the will, we commit no sin; nor would God command man to do what was impossible for human volition.\" But they do not see, that in order to overcome certain things, which are the objects either of an evil desire or an ill-conceived fear, men need the strenuous efforts, and sometimes even all the energies, of the will; and that we should only imperfectly employ these in every instance, He foresaw who willed so true an utterance to be spoken by the prophet: \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified.\"[fn-7-P737_467527:3-nf] The Lord, therefore, foreseeing that such would be our character, was pleased to provide and endow with efficacious virtue certain healthful remedies against the guilt and bonds even of sins committed after baptism,-for instance, the works of mercy,-as when he says: \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you.\"[fn-7-P738_467887:4-nf] For who could quit this life with any hope ofobtaining eternal salvation, with that sentence impending: \"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,\"[fn-7-P739_468099:5-nf] if there did not soon after follow: \"So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty: for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment?\"[fn-7-P740_468335:6-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"[2nd.] If, however, I am asked the second question which I have suggested,-whether there be a sinless man,-I believe there is not.

It was therefore necessary to mention God's loving-kindness and tender mercy there, where one might expect debts to be demanded and deserts recompensed so strictly as to leave no room for mercy. He crowns, therefore, with loving-kindness and tender mercy; but even so according to works. For he shall be separated to the right hand, to whom, it is said, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat.\"[fn-17-P1783_787204:347-nf] There will, however, be also \"judgment without mercy;\" but it will be for him\" that hath not showed mercy.\"[fn-17-P1784_787334:348-nf] But \"blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\"[fn-17-P1785_787414:349-nf] of God. Then, as soon as those on the left hand shall have gone into eternal fire, the righteous, too, shall go into everlasting life,[fn-17-P1786_787568:350-nf] because He says: \"This is life eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-17-P1787_787712:351-nf] And with this knowledge, this vision, this contemplation, shall the desire of their soul be satisfied; for it shall be enough for it to have this and nothing else,-there being nothing more for it to desire, to aspire to, or to require.

There is much to tell of faith, and the whole day would not be time sufficient for us to describe it fully. At present let us be content with Abraham only, as one of the examples from the Old Testament, seeing that we have been made his sons through faith. He was justified not only by works, but also by faith[fn-6-P674_156140:19-nf] : for though he did many things well, yet he was never called the friend of God[fn-6-P675_156484:20-nf] , except when he believed. Moreover, his every work was performed in faith. Through faith he left his parents; left country, and place, and home through faith[fn-6-P676_156702:21-nf] . In like manner, therefore, as he was justified be thou justified also.

For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God. Melchizedek also, \"the priest of the most high God,\" uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was chosen to the priesthood of God.[fn-20-P2065_704730:34-nf] Lot, withal, the brother[fn-20-P2066_704771:35-nf] of Abraham, proves that it was for the merits of righteousness, without observance of the law, that he was freed from the conflagration of the Sodomites.[fn-20-P2067_704969:36-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For why should God, the founder of the universe, the Governor of the whole world,[fn-20-P2045_697669:14-nf] the Fashioner of humanity, the Sower[fn-20-P2046_697718:15-nf] of universal nations be believed to have given a law through Moses to one people, and not be said to have assigned it to all nations?

This would be a real difficulty and one for ever incapable of solution were it not solved by the witness of John himself, who immediately goes on to say,[fn-65-P6593_2064420:4-nf] \"My little children, guard yourselves from idols.\" If everyone that is born of God sinneth not, and cannot be tempted by the devil, how is it that he bids them beware of temptation? Again in the same Epistle we read:[fn-65-P6594_2064654:5-nf] \"If we say that we have no sins, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.\" I suppose that John was baptized and was writing to the baptized: I imagine too that all sin is of the devil. Now John confesses himself a sinner, and hopes for forgiveness of sins after baptism. My friend Jovinianus says,[fn-65-P6595_2065178:6-nf] \"Touch me not, for I am clean.\" What then? Does the Apostle contradict himself? By no means. In the same passage he gives his reason for thus speaking:[fn-65-P6596_2065429:7-nf] \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. And hereby know we that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby know we that we are in him: he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" My reason for telling you, little children, that everyone who is born of God sinneth not, is that you may not sin, and that you may know that so long as you sin not I you abide in the birth which God has given you. Yea, they who abide in that birth cannot sin.[fn-65-P6597_2066320:8-nf] \"For what communion hath light with darkness? Or Christ with Belial?\" As day is distinct from night, so righteousness and unrighteousness, sin and good works, Christ and Antichrist cannot blend. If we give Christ a lodging-place in our hearts, we banish the devil from thence. If we sin and the devil enter through the gate of sin, Christ will immediately withdraw. Hence David after sinning says:[fn-65-P6598_2066751:9-nf] \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,\" that is, the joy which he had lost by sinning.[fn-65-P6599_2066858:10-nf] \"He who saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" Christ is called the truth:[fn-66-P6600_2067007:11-nf] \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" In vain do we make our boast in him whose commandments we keep not. To him that knoweth what is good, and doeth it not, it is sin.[fn-66-P6601_2067199:12-nf] \"As the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.\" And we must not think it a great matter to know the only God, when even devils believe and tremble. \"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" Our opponent may choose whichever of the two he likes; we give him his choice. Does he abide in Christ, or not? If he abide, let him then walk as Christ walked. But if there is[fn-66-P6602_2067660:13-nf] rashness in professing to copy the virtues of our Lord, he does not abide in Christ, for he does not walk as did Christ.[fn-66-P6603_2068078:14-nf] \"He did not sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again, and as a lamb is dumb before its shearer, so opened he not his mouth.\" To Him came the prince of this world, and found nothing in Him: although He had done no sin, God made Him sin for us. But we, according to the Epistle of James,[fn-66-P6604_2068429:15-nf] \"all stumble in many things,\" and[fn-66-P6605_2068482:16-nf] \"no one is pure from sin, no not if his life be but a day long.\"[fn-66-P6606_2068582:17-nf] For who will boast \"that he has a clean heart? or who will be sure that he is pure from sin?\" And we are held guilty after the similitude of Adam's transgression. Hence David says,[fn-66-P6607_2068781:18-nf] \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" And the blessed Job,[fn-66-P6608_2068892:19-nf] \"Though I be righteous my mouth will speak wickedness, and though I be perfect, I shall be found perverse. If I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean, yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me.\" But that we may not utterly despair and think that if we sin after baptism we cannot be saved, he immediately checks the tendency:[fn-66-P6609_2069307:20-nf] \"And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins. And not for ours only, but also for the whole world.\" He addresses this to baptized believers, and he promises them the Lord as an advocate for their offences. He does not say: If you fall into sin, you have an advocate with the Father, Christ, and He is the propitiation for your sins: you might then say that he was addressing those whose baptism had been destitute of the true faith: but what he says is this, \"We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, and he is the propitiation for our sins.\" And not only for the sins of John and his contemporaries, but for those of the whole world. Now in \"the whole world\" are included apostles and all the faithful, and a clear proof is established that sin after baptism is possible. It is useless for us to have an advocate Jesus Christ, if sin be impossible.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_11_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. The apostle Peter, to whom it was said,[fn-66-P6611_2070323:21-nf] \"He that is bathed needeth not to wash again,\" and[fn-66-P6612_2070397:22-nf] \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,\" through fear of a maid-servant denied Him. Our Lord himself says,[fn-66-P6613_2070547:23-nf] \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" And in the same place, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" If you reply that this was said before the Passion, we certainly say after the Passion, in the Lord's prayer,[fn-66-P6614_2070948:24-nf] \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\" If we do not sin after baptism, why do we ask that we may be forgiven our sins, which were already forgiven in baptism? Why do we pray that we may not enter into temptation, and that we may be delivered from the evil one, if the devil cannot tempt those who are baptized? The case is different if this prayer belongs to the Catechumens, and is not adapted to faithful Christians. Paul, the chosen vessel,[fn-66-P6615_2071498:25-nf] chastised his body, and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate, and[fn-66-P6616_2071645:26-nf] he tells that there was given to him \"a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet\" him. And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy. But they to whom He says: \"Remember from whence thou art fallen \"; and, \"Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried\"; and, \"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is\"; and, \"Remember how thou hast received, and didst hear, and keep it, and repent,\" and so on, were of course believers, and baptized, who once stood, but fell through sin.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And yet the passages are true which he goes on to adduce by way of answer, saying: \"The Saviour in the gospel declares, `Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.'[fn-26-P2660_1048319:161-nf] David also says, `Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that is innocent in his hands, and pure in his heart;'[fn-26-P2661_1048496:162-nf] and again in another passage, `Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good and upright in heart.'[fn-26-P2662_1048614:163-nf] So also in Solomon: `Riches are good unto him that hath no sin on his conscience;'[fn-26-P2663_1048717:164-nf] and again in the same book, `Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from wickedness.'[fn-26-P2664_1048861:165-nf] So in the Epistle of John, `If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God; and whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.'\"[fn-26-P2665_1049033:166-nf] For all this is accomplished by the will, by the exercise of faith, hope, and love; by keeping under the body; by doing alms; by forgiving injuries; by earnest prayer; by supplicating for strength to advance in our course; by sincerely saying, \"Forgive us, as we also forgive others,\" and \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\"[fn-26-P2666_1049406:167-nf] By this process, it is certainly brought about that our heart is cleansed, and all our sin taken away; and what the righteous King, when sitting on His throne, shall find concealed in the heart and uncleansed as yet, shall be remitted by His mercy, so that the whole shall be rendered sound and cleansed for seeing God. For\" he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy: yet mercy triumpheth against judgment.\"[fn-26-P2667_1049861:168-nf] If it were not so, what hope could any of us have? \"When, indeed, the righteous King shall sit upon His throne, who shall boast that he hath a pure heart, or who shall boldly say that he is pure from sin?\" Then, however, through His mercy shall the righteous, being by that time fully and perfectly cleansed, shine forth like the glorious sun in the kingdom of their Father.[fn-26-P2668_1050257:169-nf] ","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"They also, says he, \"quote the text:`For in thy sight shall no man living be justified.'\"[fn-26-P2696_1055989:185-nf] And his affected answer to this passage amounts to nothing else than the showing how texts of Holy Scripture seem to clash with one another, whereas it is our duty rather to demonstrate their agreement. These are his words: \"We must confront them with this answer, from the testimony of the evangelist concerning holy Zacharias and Elisabeth, when he says, `And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.'\"[fn-26-P2697_1056482:186-nf] Now both these righteous persons had, of course, read amongst these very commandments the method of cleansing their own sins. For, according to what is said in the Epistle to the Hebrews of \"every high priest taken from among men,\"[fn-26-P2698_1056732:187-nf] Zacharias used no doubt to offer sacrifices even for his own sins. The meaning, however, of the phrase \"blameless,\" which is applied to him, we have already, as I suppose, sufficiently explained.[fn-26-P2699_1056946:188-nf] \"And,\" he adds, \"the blessed apostle says, `That we should be holy, and without blame before Him.'\"[fn-27-P2700_1057078:189-nf] This, according to him, is said that we should be so, if those persons are to be understood by \"blameless\" who are altogether without sin. If, however, they are \"blameless\" who are without blame or censure, then it is impossible for us to deny that there have been, and still are, such persons even in this present life; for it does not follow that a man is without sin because be has not a blot of accusation. Accordingly the apostle, when selecting ministers for ordination, does not say, \"If any be sinless,\" for he would be unable to find any such; but he says, \"If any be without accusation,\"[fn-27-P2701_1057694:190-nf] for such, of course, he would be able to find.

And these two states of mind the poet carefully distinguishes, when he says: \"Permit the fearful to have hope.\"[fn-22-P2223_1107238:10-nf] Another poet, who is usually much superior to this one, makes a wrong use of the word, when he says: \"If I have been able to hope for so great a grief as this.\"[fn-22-P2224_1107426:11-nf] And some grammarians take this case as an example of impropriety of speech, saying, \"He said sperare [to hope] instead of timere [to fear].\" Accordingly, faith may have for its object evil as well as good; for both good and evil are believed, and the faith that believes them is not evil, but good. Faith, moreover, is concerned with the past, the present, and the future, all three. We believe, for example, that Christ died,-an event in the past; we believe that He is sitting at the right hand of God,-a state of things which is present; we believe that He will come to judge the quick and the dead,-an event of the future. Again, faith applies both to one's own circumstances and those of others. Every one, for example, believes that his own existence had a beginning, and was not eternal, and he believes the same both of other men and other things. Many of our beliefs in regard to religious matters, again, have reference not merely to other men, but to angels also. But hope has for its object only what is good, only what is future, and only what affects the man who entertains the hope. For these reasons, then, faith must be distinguished from hope, not merely as a matter of verbal propriety, but because they are essentially different. The fact that we do not see either what we believe or what we hope for, is all that is common to faith and hope. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, for example, faith is defined (and eminent defenders of the catholic faith have used the definition as a standard) \"the evidence of things not seen.\"[fn-22-P2225_1109000:12-nf] Although, should any one say that he believes, that is, has grounded his faith, not on words, nor on witnesses, nor on any reasoning whatever, but on the direct evidence of his own senses, he would not be guilty of such an impropriety of speech as to be justly liable to the criticism, \"You saw,therefore you did not believe.\" And hence it does not follow that an object of faith is not an object of sight. But it is better that we should use the word \"faith\" as the Scriptures have taught us, applying it to those things which are not seen. Concerning hope, again, the apostle says: \"Hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-22-P2226_1109756:13-nf] When, then, we believe that good is about to come, this is nothing else but to hope for it. Now what shall I say of love? Without it, faith profits nothing; and in its absence, hope cannot exist. The Apostle James says: \"The devils also believe, and tremble.\"[fn-22-P2227_1110040:14-nf] -that is, they, having neither hope nor love, but believing that what we love and hope for is about to come, are in terror. And so the Apostle Paul approves and commends the \"faith that worketh by love;\"[fn-22-P2228_1110262:15-nf] and this certainly cannot exist without hope. Wherefore there is no love without hope, no hope without love, and neither love nor hope without faith.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":69,"source_paragraph":"272","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"It is believed, moreover, by some, that men who do not abandon the name of Christ, and who have been baptized in the Church by His baptism, and who have never been cut off from the Church by any schism or heresy, though they should live in the grossest sin and never either wash it away in penitence nor redeem it by almsgiving, but persevere in it persistently to the last day of their lives, shall be saved by fire; that is, that although they shall suffer a punishment by fire, lasting for a time proportionate to the magnitude of their crimes and misdeeds, they shall not be punished with everlasting fire. But those who believe this, and yet are Catholics, seem to me to be led astray by a kind of benevolent feeling natural to humanity. For Holy Scripture, when consulted, gives a very different answer. I have written a book on this subject, entitled Of Faith and Works, in which, to the best of my ability, God assisting me, I have shown from Scripture, that the faith which saves us is that which the Apostle Paul clearly enough describes when he says: \"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.\"[fn-25-P2518_1205607:128-nf] But if it worketh evil, and not good, then without doubt, as the Apostle James says, \"it is dead, being alone.\"[fn-25-P2519_1205737:129-nf] The same apostle says again, \"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works?

And that must be false which Paul himself says in another place: \"Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners; shall inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-25-P2522_1206544:132-nf] For if those who persevere in these wicked courses shall nevertheless be saved on account of their faith in Christ, how can it be true that they shall not inherit the kingdom of God?","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_16_letter_ii_a_letter_of_sulpitius_severus_to_his_sister_claudia_concerning_virginity_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But (as we had begun to remark) it is not sufficient for a Christian to keep himself from wickedness, unless he also has fulfilled the duties implied in good works, as is very distinctly proved by that statement in which the Lord threatened that those will be doomed to eternal fire, who, although they have done no evil, have not done all that is good, declaring \"Then will the king say to those who are on his fight hand: depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal fire, which my Father has prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no[fn-7-P769_307790:17-nf] drink,\" with what follows. He did not say, \"Depart from me, ye cursed, because ye have committed murder, or adultery, or theft\"; for it is not because they had done evil, but because they had not done good, that they are condemned, and doomed to the punishments of the eternal Gehenna; nor because they had committed things which were forbidden, but because they had not been willing to do those things which had been commanded. And from this it is to be observed what hope those can have, who, in addition, do some of those things which are forbidden, when even such are doomed to eternal fire as have simply not done the things which are commanded. For I do not wish you to flatter yourself in this way,-if you have not done certain things, because you have done certain other things, since it is written, \"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, has become guilty of all.\"[fn-7-P770_308710:18-nf] For Adam sinned once, and died; and do you think that you can live, when you are often doing that which. killed another person, when he had only done it once? Or do you imagine that he committed a great crime, and was therefore justly condemned to a severer punishment? Let us consider, then, what it was he really did. He ate of the fruit of the tree, contrary to the commandment. What then? Did God punish man with death for the sake of the fruit of a tree?No: not on account of the fruit of the tree, but on account of the contempt of the commandment. The question, therefore, is not about the nature of the offense, but about the transgression of the commandment. And the same being who told Adam not to eat of the fruit of the tree, has commanded you not to speak evil, not to lie, not to detract, not to listen to a detractor, to swear not at all, not to covet, not to envy, not to be drunken, not to be greedy, not to render evil for evil to any one, to love your enemies, to bless them that curse you, to pray for them that malign and persecute you, to turn the other cheek to one smiting you, and not to go to law before a worldly tribunal, so that, if any one seeks to take away your goods, you should joyfully lose them, to flee from the charge of avarice, to beware of the sin of all pride and boastfulness, and live, humble and meek, after the example of Christ, avoiding fellowship with the wicked so completely that you will not even eat with fornicators, or covetous persons, or those that speak evil of others, or the envious, or detractors, or the drunken, or the rapacious. Now, if you despise him in any such matter, then, if he spared Adam, he will also spare you. Yea, he might have been spared with better reason than you, inasmuch as he was still ignorant and inexperienced, and was restrained by the example of no one who had previously sinned, and who had died on account of his sin.But after such examples as you possess, after the law, after the prophets, after the gospels, and after the apostles, if you still set your mind on transgressing, I see not in what way pardon can be extended to you.","title":"Letter II.

But the peace which we enjoy in this life, whether common to all or peculiar to ourselves, is rather the solace of our misery than the positive enjoyment of felicity. Our very righteousness, too, though true in so far as it has respect to the true good, is yet in this life of such a kind that it consists rather in the remission of sins than in the perfecting of virtues. Witness the prayer of the whole city of God in its pilgrim state, for it cries to God by the mouth of all its members, \"Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.\"[fn-37-P3754_2072159:48-nf] And this prayer is efficacious not for those whose faith is \"without works and dead,\"[fn-37-P3755_2072264:49-nf] but for those whose faith \"worketh by love.\"[fn-37-P3756_2072327:50-nf] For as reason, though subjected to God, is yet \"pressed down by the corruptible body,\"[fn-37-P3757_2072430:51-nf] so long as it is in this mortal condition, it has not perfect authority over vice, and therefore this prayer is needed by the righteous. For though it exercises authority, the vices do not submit without a struggle. For however well one maintains the conflict, and however thoroughly he has subdued these enemies, there steals in some evil thing, which, if it does not find ready expression in act, slips out by the lips, or insinuates itself into the thought; and therefore his peace is not full so long as he is at war with his vices. For it is a doubtful conflict he wages with those that resist, and his victory over those that are defeated is not secure, but full of anxiety and effort. Amidst these temptations, therefore, of all which it has been summarily said in the divine oracles, \"Is not human life upon earth a temptation?\"[fn-37-P3758_2073287:52-nf] who but a proud man can presume that he so lives that he has no need to say to God, \"Forgive us our debts?\" And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed up with vanity, and is justly resisted by Him who abundantly gives grace to the humble. Whence it is said, \"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.\"[fn-37-P3759_2073630:53-nf] In this, then, consists the righteousness of a man, that he submit himself to God, his body to his soul, and his vices, even when they rebel, to his reason, which either defeats or at least resists them; and also that he beg from God grace to do his duty,[fn-37-P3760_2073916:54-nf] and the pardon of his sins, and that he render to God thanks for all the blessings he receives. But, in that final peace to which all our righteousness has reference, and for the sake of which it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound immortality and incorruption, and shall have no more vices, and as we shall experience no resistance either from ourselves or from others, it will not be necessary that reason should rule vices which no longer exist, but God shall rule the man, and the soul shall rule the body, with a sweetness and facility suitable to the felicity of a life which is done with bondage. And this condition shall there be eternal, and we shall be assured of its eternity; and thus the peace of this blessedness and the blessedness of this peace shall be the supreme good.","title":"Book XIX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Abraham, styled \"the friend,\"[fn-53-P5366_769708:53-nf] was found faithful, inasmuch as he rendered obedience to the words of God.

Wherefore to those whom He is about to condemn, yea, rather to those whom He is about to crown, He will impute alms only, as though He would say, \"It were a hard matter for me not to find occasion to condemn you, were I to examine and weigh you accurately and with much exactness to scrutinize your deeds; but, \"Go into the kingdom, for I was hungry, and ye gave Me meat.\" Ye shall therefore go into the kingdom, not because ye have not sinned, but because ye have redeemed your sins by alms.

Whence it is not for any other reason that He says, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,\" than because they did not choose Him that He should choose them, but He chose them that they might choose Him; because His mercy preceded them according to grace, not according to debt. Therefore He chose them out of the word while He was wearing flesh, but as those who were already chosen in Himself before the foundation of the world.

Therefore they were elected before the foundation of the world with that predestination in which God foreknew what He Himself would do; but they were elected out of the world with that calling whereby God fulfilled that which He predestinated. For whom He predestinated, them He also called, with that calling, to wit, which is according to the purpose. Not others, therefore, but those whom He predestinated, them He also called; nor other, but those whom He so called, them He also justified; nor others, but those whom He predestinated, called, and justified, them He also glorified; assuredly to that end which has no end.

I Suppose ye remember, those of you who were present yesterday, to what place in the course of this epistle our exposition has reached: namely, \"He that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not? And this commandment have we from Him, That he who loveth God, love his brother also.\"[fn-46-P4622_2490897:1-nf] Thus far we discoursed. Let us see then what comes next in order. \"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.\"[fn-46-P4623_2491048:2-nf] Who is he that believeth not that Jesus is the Christ? He that does not so live as Christ commanded. For many say, \"I believe:\" but faith without works saveth not. Now the work of faith is Love, as Paul the apostle saith, \"And faith which worketh by love.\"[fn-46-P4624_2491321:3-nf] Thy past works indeed, before thou didst believe, were either none, or if they seemed good, were nothing worth. For if they were none, thou wast as a man without feet, or with sore feet unableto walk: but if they seemed good, before thou didst believe, thou didst run indeed, but by running aside from the way thou wentest astray instead of coming to the goal. It is for us, then, both to run, and to run in the way. He that runs aside from the way, runs to no purpose, or rather runs but to toil. He goes the more astray, the more he runs aside from the way. What is the way by which we run? Christ hath told us, \"I am the Way.\"[fn-46-P4625_2491965:4-nf] What the home to which we run? \"I am the Truth.\" By Him thou runnest, to Him thou runnest, in Him thou restest. But, that we might run by Him, He reached even unto us: for we were afar off, foreigners in a far country. Not enough that we were in a far country, we were feeble also that we could not stir. A Physician, He came to the sick: a Way, He extended Himself to them that were in a far country. Let us be saved by Him, let us walk in Him. This it is to \"believe that Jesus is the Christ,\" as Christians believe, who are not Christians only in name, but in deeds and in life, not as the devils believe. For \"the devils also believe and tremble,\"[fn-46-P4626_2492633:5-nf] as the Scripture tells us. What more could the devils believe, than that they should say, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God?\"[fn-46-P4627_2492780:6-nf] What the devils said, the same said Peter also. When the Lord asked them who He was, and whom did men say that He was, the disciples made answer to Him, \"Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.\"[fn-46-P4628_2493190:7-nf] And this he heard from the Lord: \"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\" See what praises follow this faith. \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" What meaneth, \"Upon this rock I will build my Church\"? Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,\" saith He, \"I will build my Church.\" Mighty praise! So then, Peter saith, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God:\" the devils also say, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God, the Holy One of God.\" This Peter said, this also the devils: the words the same, the mind not the same. And how is it clear that Peter said this with love? Because a Christian's faith is with love, but a devil's without love. How without love? Peter said this, that he might embrace Christ; the devils said it, that Christ might depart from them. For before they said, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God, they said, \"What have we to do with thee? Why art thou come to destroy us before the time?\" It is one thing then to confess Christ that thou mayest hold Christ, another thing to confess Christ that thou mayest drive Christ from thee. So then ye see, that in the sense in which he here saith, \"Whoso believeth,\" it is a faith of one's own, not as one has a faith in common with many. Therefore, brethren, let none of the heretics say to you, \"We also believe.\" For to this end have I given you an instance from the case of devils, that ye may not rejoice in the words of believing, but search well the deeds of the life.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_52_oration_xl_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XIX.

And when the heretic had approached him with his dialectic art, and wanted to drag him away in his ignorance to the thorns of Aristotle, the blessed Macarius put a stop to his chatter with apostolic brevity, saying: the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.\"[fn-56-P5614_2004604:10-nf] Let us go therefore to the tombs, and let us invoke the name of the Lord over the first dead man we find, and let us, as it is written, \"show our faith by our works,\"[fn-56-P5615_2004791:11-nf] that by His testimony the manifest proofs of a right faith may be shown, and we may prove the clear truth not by an empty discussion of words but by the power of miracles and that judgment which cannot be deceived. And when he heard this the heretic was overwhelmed with shame before the people who were present, and pretended for the moment that he consented to the terms proposed, and promised that he would come on the morrow, but the next day when they were all in expectation who had come together with greater eagerness to the appointed place, owing to their desire for the spectacle, he was terrified by the consciousness of his want of faith, and fled away, and at once escaped out of all Egypt. And when the blessed Macarius had waited together with the people till the ninth hour, and saw that he had owing to his guilty conscience avoided him, he took the people, who had been perverted by him and went to the tombs determined upon. Now in Egypt the overflow of the river Nile has introduced this custom that, since the whole breadth of that country is covered for no small part of the year by the regular flood of waters like a great sea so that there is no means of getting about except by a passage in boats, the bodies of the dead are embalmed and stored away in cells an good height up. For the soil of that land being damp from the continual moisture prevents them from burying them. For if it receives any bodies buried in it, it is forced by the excessive inundations to cast them forth on its surface. When then the blessed Macarius had taken up his position by a most ancient corpse, he said \"O man, if that heretic and son of perdition had come hither with me, and, while he was standing by, I had exclaimed and invoked the name of Christ my God, say in the presence of these who were almost perverted by his fraud, whether you would have arisen.\" Then he arose and replied with words of assent. And then Abbot Macarius asked him what he had formerly been when he enjoyed life here, or in what age of men he had lived, or if he had then known the name of Christ, and he replied that he had lived under kings of most ancient date, and declared that in those days he had never heard the name of Christ. To whom once more Abbot Macarius: \"Sleep,\" said he, \"in peace with the others in your own order, to be roused again by Christ in the end.\" All this power then and grace of his which was in him would perhaps have always been hidden, unless the needs of the whole province which was endangered, and his entire devotion to Christ, and unfeigned love, had forced him to perform this miracle. And certainly it was not the ostentation of glory but the love of Christ and the good of all the people that wrung from him the performance of it. As the passage in the book of Kings shows us that the blessed Elijah also did, who asked that fire might descend from heaven on the sacrifices laid on the pyre, for this reason that he might set free the faith of the whole people which was endangered by the tricks of the false prophets.","title":"XV.

Is, then, the commandment about that love wherewith we love one another, His only one? Is there not also another that is still greater,-that we should love God? Or has God in very truth given us such a charge about love alone, that we have no need of searching for others? There are three things at least that the apostle commends when he says, \"But now abide faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\"[fn-29-P2929_1676881:6-nf] And although in charity, that is, in love, are comprehended the two commandments; yet it is here declared to be the greatest only, and not the sole one. Accordingly, what a host of commandments are given us about faith, what a multitude about hope! who is there that could collect them together, or suffice to number them? But let us ponder the words of the same apostle: \"Love is the fullness of the law.\"[fn-29-P2930_1677308:7-nf] And so, where there is love, what can be wanting? and where it is not, what is there that can possibly be profitable? The devil believes,[fn-29-P2931_1677464:8-nf] but does not love: no one loveth who doth not believe. One may, indeed, hope for pardon who does not love, but he hopes in vain; but no one can despair who loves. Therefore, where there is love, there of necessity will there be faith and hope; and where there is the love of our neighbor, there also of necessity will be the love of God. For he that loveth not God, how loveth he his neighbour as himself, seeing that he loveth not even himself? Such an one is both impious and iniquitous; and he that loveth iniquity, manifestly loveth not, but hateth his own soul.[fn-29-P2932_1678047:9-nf] Let us, therefore, be holding fast to this precept of the Lord, to love one another; and then all else that is commanded we shall do, for all else we have contained in this. But this love is distinguished from that which men bear to one another as such; for in order to mark the distinction, it is added, \"as I have loved you.\" And wherefore is it that Christ loveth us, but that we may be fitted to reign with Christ? With this aim, therefore, let us also be loving one another, that we may manifest the difference of our love from that of others, who have no such motive in loving one another, because the love itself is wanting. But those whose mutual love has the possession of God Himself for its object, will truly love one another; and, therefore, even for the very purpose of loving one another, they love God. There is no such love as this in all men; for few have this motive for their love one to another, that God may be all in all.[fn-29-P2933_1679351:10-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_97_epistle_lxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"ANF-05","text":"23. But some one says, \"What, then, shall become of those who in past times, coming from heresy to the Church, were received without baptism? \"The Lord is able by His mercy to give indulgence,[fn-63-P6327_2016062:35-nf] and not to separate from the gifts of His Church those who by simplicity were admitted into the Church, and in the Church have fallen asleep. Nevertheless it does not follow that, because there was error at one time, there must always be error; since it is more fitting for wise and God-fearing men, gladly and without delay to obey the truth when laid open and perceived, than pertinaciously and obstinately to struggle against brethren and fellow-priests on behalf of heretics.","title":"Epistle LXXII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_87_acts_of_the_holy_apostles_peter_and_paul","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-08","text":"While they were contending in these and such-like words, the Apostle Paul said that they ought not to make such attacks upon each other, but that they should rather give heed to this, that God had fulfilled His promises which He swore to Abraham our father, that in his seed he should inherit all the nations.[fn-74-P7458_2272620:9-nf] For there is no respect of persons with God.[fn-74-P7459_2272691:10-nf] As many as have sinned in law shall be judged according to law, and as many as have sinned without law shall perish without law.[fn-74-P7460_2272876:11-nf] But we, brethren, ought to thank God that, according to His mercy, He has chosen us to be a holy people to Himself: so that in this we ought to boast, whether Jews or Greeks; for you are all one in the belief of His name.","title":"Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_87_acts_of_the_holy_apostles_peter_and_paul","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-08","text":"While they were contending in these and such-like words, the Apostle Paul said that they ought not to make such attacks upon each other, but that they should rather give heed to this, that God had fulfilled His promises which He swore to Abraham our father, that in his seed he should inherit all the nations.[fn-74-P7458_2272620:9-nf] For there is no respect of persons with God.[fn-74-P7459_2272691:10-nf] As many as have sinned in law shall be judged according to law, and as many as have sinned without law shall perish without law.[fn-74-P7460_2272876:11-nf] But we, brethren, ought to thank God that, according to His mercy, He has chosen us to be a holy people to Himself: so that in this we ought to boast, whether Jews or Greeks; for you are all one in the belief of His name.","title":"Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_87_acts_of_the_holy_apostles_peter_and_paul","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-08","text":"While they were contending in these and such-like words, the Apostle Paul said that they ought not to make such attacks upon each other, but that they should rather give heed to this, that God had fulfilled His promises which He swore to Abraham our father, that in his seed he should inherit all the nations.[fn-74-P7458_2272620:9-nf] For there is no respect of persons with God.[fn-74-P7459_2272691:10-nf] As many as have sinned in law shall be judged according to law, and as many as have sinned without law shall perish without law.[fn-74-P7460_2272876:11-nf] But we, brethren, ought to thank God that, according to His mercy, He has chosen us to be a holy people to Himself: so that in this we ought to boast, whether Jews or Greeks; for you are all one in the belief of His name.","title":"Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_87_acts_of_the_holy_apostles_peter_and_paul","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-08","text":"While they were contending in these and such-like words, the Apostle Paul said that they ought not to make such attacks upon each other, but that they should rather give heed to this, that God had fulfilled His promises which He swore to Abraham our father, that in his seed he should inherit all the nations.[fn-74-P7458_2272620:9-nf] For there is no respect of persons with God.[fn-74-P7459_2272691:10-nf] As many as have sinned in law shall be judged according to law, and as many as have sinned without law shall perish without law.[fn-74-P7460_2272876:11-nf] But we, brethren, ought to thank God that, according to His mercy, He has chosen us to be a holy people to Himself: so that in this we ought to boast, whether Jews or Greeks; for you are all one in the belief of His name.","title":"Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"}]
