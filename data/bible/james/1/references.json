For if it is justice for a man to put himself on a level even with those of lower rank, although he excels in this very thing, that he made himself equal to his inferiors; yet if he has conducted himself not only as an equal, but even as an inferior, he will plainly obtain a much higher rank of dignity in the judgment of God[fn-19-P1971_781162:119-nf] For assuredly, since all things in this temporal life are frail and liable to decay, men both prefer themselves to others, and contend about dignity; than which nothing is more foul, nothing mere arrogant, nothing more removed from the conduct of a wise man: for these earthly things are altogether opposed to heavenly things. For as the wisdom of men is the greatest foolishness with God, and foolishness is (as I have shown) the greatest wisdom; so he is low and abject in the sight of God who shall have been conspicuous and elevated on earth. For, not to mention that these present earthly goods to which great honour is paid are contrary to virtue, and enervate the vigour of the mind, what nobility, I pray, can be so firm, what resources, what power, since God is able to make kings themselves even lower than the lowest?

In order, therefore, that the human mind might be purged from falsities of this kind, Holy Scripture, which suits itself to babes has not avoided words drawn from any class of things really existing, through which, as by nourishment, our understanding might rise gradually to things divine and transcendent. For, in speaking of God, it has both used words taken from things corporeal, as when it says, \"Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings;\"[fn-1-P175_53734:2-nf] and it has borrowed many things from the spiritual creature, whereby to signify that which indeed is not so, but must needs so be said: as, for instance, \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God;\"[fn-1-P176_53943:3-nf] and, \"It repenteth me that I have made man.\"[fn-1-P177_54002:4-nf] But it has drawn no words whatever, whereby to frame either figures of speech or enigmatic sayings, from things which do not exist at all. And hence it is that they who are shut out from the truth by that third kind of error are more mischievously and emptily vain than their fellows; in that they surmise respecting God, what can neither be found in Himself nora in ny creature. For divine Scripture is wont to frame, as it were, allurements for children from the things which are found in the creature; whereby, according to their measure, and as it were by steps, the affections of the weak may be moved to seek those things that are above, and to leave those things that are below. But the same Scripture rarely employs those things which are spoken properly of God, and are not found in any creature; as, for instance, that which was said to Moses, \"I am that I am;\" and, \"I Am hath sent me to you.\"[fn-1-P178_54922:5-nf] For since both body and soul also are said in some sense to be, Holy Scripture certainly would not so express itself unless it meant to be understood in some special sense of the term.

Still they cried, \"Truth, Truth,\" and spoke much about it to me, \"yet was it not in them;\"[fn-4-P479_148411:14-nf] but they spake falsely not of Thee only-who, verily, art the Truth-but also of these elements of this world, Thy creatures. And I, in truth, should have passed by philosophers, even when speaking truth concerning them, for love of Thee, my Father, supremely good, beauty of all things beautiful. O Truth, Truth! how inwardly even then did the marrow of my soul pant after Thee, when they frequently, and in a multiplicity of ways, and in numerous and huge books, sounded out Thy name to me, though it was but a voice![fn-4-P480_148949:15-nf] And these were the dishes in which to me, hungering for Thee, they, instead of Thee, served up the sun and moon, Thy beauteous works-but yet Thy works, not Thyself, nay, nor Thy first works. For before these corporeal works are Thy spiritual ones, celestial and shining though they be. But I hungered and thirsted not even after those first works of Thine, but after Thee Thyself, the Truth, \"with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning;\"[fn-4-P481_150281:16-nf] yet they still served up to me in those dishes glowing phantasies, than which better were it to love this very sun (which, at least, is true to our sight), than those illusions which deceive the mind through the eye.

These things the very beasts and birds perceive as well as we, and they are more certain than when we imagine them.

It will follow that we should next in order point out the character of the provision of blessings bestowed on us by the Father \"through him.\" Inasmuch as all created nature, both this visible world and all that is conceived of in the mind, cannot hold together without the care and providence of God, the Creator Word, the Only begotten God, apportioning His succour according to the measure of the needs of each, distributes mercies various and manifold on account of the many kinds and characters of the recipients of His bounty, but appropriate to the necessities of individual requirements. Those that are confined in the darkness of ignorance He enlightens: for this reason He is true Light.[fn-13-P1354_322518:171-nf] Portioning requital in accordance with the desert of deeds, He judges: for this reason He is righteous Judge.[fn-13-P1355_322649:172-nf] \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.\"[fn-13-P1356_322744:173-nf] Those that have lapsed from the lofty height of life into sin He raises from their fall: for this reason He is Resurrection.[fn-13-P1357_322890:174-nf] Effectually working by the much of His power and the will of His goodness He does all things. He shepherds; He enlightens; He nourishes; He heals; He guides; He raises up; He calls into being things that were not; He upholds what has been created. Thus the good things that come from God reach us \"through the Son,\" who works in each case with greater speed than speech can utter. For not lightnings, not light's course in air, is so swift; not eyes' sharp turn, not the movements of our very thought. Navy by the divine energy is each one of these in speed further surpassed than is the slowest of all living creatures outdone in motion by birds, or even winds, or the rush of the heavenly bodies: or, not to mention these, by our very thought itself. For what extent of time is needed by Him who \"upholds all things by the word of His power, \"[fn-13-P1358_323755:175-nf] and works not by bodily agency, nor requires the help of hands to form and fashion, but holds in obedient following and unforced consent the nature of all things that are?

I received \"a commandment what I should say and what I should speak.\"[fn-13-P1364_326639:181-nf] Through all these words He is guiding us to the knowledge of the Father, and referring our wonder at all that is brought into existence to Him, to the end that \"through Him\" we may know the Father. For the Father is not regarded from the difference of the operations, by the exhibition of a separate and peculiar energy; for whatsoever things He sees the Father doing, \"these also doeth the Son likewise; \"[fn-13-P1365_327065:182-nf] but He enjoys our wonder at all that comes to pass out of the glory which comes to Him from the Only Begotten, rejoicing in the Doer Himself as well as in the greatness of the deeds, and exalted by all who acknowledge Him as Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, \"through whom [by whom, A.V.] are all things, and for whom are all things.\"[fn-13-P1366_327420:183-nf] Wherefore, saith the Lord, \"All mine are thine,\"[fn-13-P1367_327488:184-nf] as though the sovereignty over created things were conferred on Him, and \"Thine are mine,\" as though the creating Cause came thence to Him.

Unbaptized infants it implicates as guilty and as children of wrath, even if they die in infancy, draws into condemnation.

The whole substance, accordingly, of these three petitions may be thus briefly expressed: \"Pardon us for those things in which we have been drawn away by concupiscence; help us not to be drawn away by concupiscence; take away concupiscence from us.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_10_book_v_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"259","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"1 Serapion,[fn-32-P3285_1521474:307-nf] who, as report says, succeeded Maximinus[fn-32-P3286_1524121:308-nf] at that time as bishop of the church of Antioch, mentions the works of Apolinarius[fn-32-P3287_1524255:309-nf] against the above-mentioned heresy.

Impelled by this vain feeling, he departs from that fountain of life, from the draughts of which alone is imbibed the holiness which is itself the good life,- and from that unchanging light, by sharing in which the reasonable soul is in a certain sense inflamed, and becomes itself a created and reflected luminary; even as \"John was a burning and a shining light,\"[fn-13-P1320_663355:28-nf] who notwithstanding acknowledged the source of his own illumination in the words, \"Of His fulness have all we received.\"[fn-13-P1321_663493:29-nf] Whose, I would ask, but His, of course, in comparison with whom John indeed was no light a t all?

What the law of works enjoins by menace, that the law of faith secures by faith. The one says, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-14-P1416_692191:91-nf] the other says, \"When I perceived that nobody could be continent, except God gave it to him; and that this was the very point of wisdom, to know whose gift she was; I approached unto the Lord, and I besought Him.\"[fn-14-P1417_692422:92-nf] This indeed is the very wisdom which is called piety, in which is worshipped \"the Father of lights, from whom is every best giving and perfect gift.\"[fn-14-P1418_692594:93-nf] This worship, however, consists in the sacrifice of praise and giving of thanks, so that the worshipper of God boasts not in himself, but in Him.[fn-14-P1419_692757:94-nf] Accordingly, by the law of works, God says to us, Do what I command thee; but by the law of faith we say to God, Give me what Thou commandest. Now this is the reason why the law gives its command, - to admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that he to whom the command is given, if he is as yet unable to perform it, may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability, and complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the ability comes. \"For we have received not the spirit of this world,\" says again that most constant preacher of grace, \"but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-14-P1420_693454:95-nf] What, however, \"is the spirit of this world,\" but the spirit of pride? By it their foolish heart is darkened, who, although knowing God, glorified Him not as God, by giving Him thanks.[fn-14-P1421_693660:96-nf] Moreover, it is really by this same spirit that they too are deceived, who, while ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to God's righteousness.[fn-14-P1422_693890:97-nf] It appears to me, therefore, that he is much more \"a child of faith\" who has learned from what source to hope for what he has not yet, than he who attributes to himself whatever he has; although, no doubt, to both of these must be preferred the man who both has, and at the same time knows from whom he has it, if nevertheless he does not believe himself to be what he has not yet attained to. Let him not fall into the mistake of the Pharisee, who, while thanking God for what he possessed, yet failed to ask for any further gift, just as if he stood in, want of nothing for the increase or perfection of his righteousness.[fn-14-P1423_694531:98-nf] Now, having duly considered and weighed all these circumstances and testimonies, we conclude that a man is not justified by the precepts of a holy life, but by faith in Jesus Christ,-in a word, not by the law of works, but by the law of faith; not by the letter,but by the spirit; not by the merits of deeds, but by free grace.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"183","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But there is yet another distinction to be observed,-since they who are under the law both attempt to work their own righteousness through fear of punishment, and fail to do God's righteousness, because this is accomplished by the love to which only what is lawful is pleasing, and never by the fear which is forced to have in its work the thing which is lawful, although it has something else in its will which would prefer, if it were only possible, that to be lawful which is not lawful. These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which is said of them, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled?\"[fn-17-P1738_775648:311-nf] Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him. This is that righteousness of God, which He not only teaches us by the precept of His law, but also bestows upon us by the gift of His Spirit.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":65,"source_paragraph":"197","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But inasmuch as it may be said that the instances which I have been quoting are divine works, whereas to live righteously is a work that belongs to ourselves, I undertook to show that even this too is a divine work.

And I am never so much delighted in my treatment of a subject as when Scripture comes most copiously to my aid; and when the question to be discussed requires that \"he that glorieth should glory in the Lord;\"[fn-18-P1818_796284:370-nf] and that we should in all things lift up our hearts and give thanks to the Lord our God, from whom, \"as the Father of lights, every good and every perfect gift cometh down.\"[fn-18-P1819_796479:371-nf] Now if a gift is not God's gift, because it is wrought by us, or because we act by His gift, then it is not a work of God that \"a mountain should be removed into the sea,\" inasmuch as, according to the Lord's statement, it is by the faith of men that this is possible. Moreover, He attributes the deed to their actual operation: \"If ye have faith in yourselves as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, \"Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and it shall be done, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-18-P1820_797033:372-nf] Observe how He said \"to you,\" not \"to Me\" or \"to the Father;\" and yet it is certain that no man does such a thing without God's gift and operation. See how an instance of perfect righteousness is unexampled among men, and yet is not impossible. For it might be achieved if there were only applied so much of will as suffices for so great a thing. There would, however, be so much will, if there were hidden from us none of those conditions which pertain to righteousness; and at the same time these so delighted our mind, that whatever hindrance of pleasure or pain might else occur, this delight in holiness would prevail over every rival affection. And that this is not realized, is not owing to any intrinsic impossibility, but to God's judicial act. For who can be ignorant, that what he should know is not in man's power; nor does it follow that what he has discovered to be a desirable object is actually desired, unless he also feel a delight in that object, commensurate with its claims on his affection?

But in the love of carnal and temporal things, as in the offspring of animals, the conception of the word is one thing, the bringing forth another. For here what is conceived by desiring is born by attaining. Since it does; not suffice to avarice to know and to love gold, except it also have it; nor to know and love to eat, or to lie with any one, unless also one does it; nor to know and love honors and power, unless they actually come to pass.

Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth.\" After the crucifixion of Christ, we find in the[fn-64-P6464_2000551:293-nf] Acts of the Apostles that one house, that of Philip the Evangelist, produced four virgin daughters, to the end that Caesarea, where the Gentile Church had been consecrated in the person of Cornelius the centurion, might afford an illustration of virginity. And whereas our Lord said in the Gospel:[fn-64-P6465_2000865:294-nf] \"The law and the prophets were until John,\" they because they were virgins are related to have prophesied even after John. For they could not be bound by the law of the Old Testament, who had shone with the brightness of virginity. Let us pass on to James, who was called the brother of the Lord, a man of such sanctity and righteousness, and distinguished by so rigid and perpetual a virginity, that even[fn-64-P6466_2001292:295-nf] Josephus, the Jewish historian, relates that the overthrow of Jerusalem was due to his death. He, the first bishop of the Church at Jerusalem, which was composed of Jewish believers, to whom Paul went, accompanied by Titus and Barnabas, says in his Epistle:[fn-64-P6467_2001614:296-nf] \"Be not deceived, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights,[fn-64-P6468_2001772:297-nf] with whom there is no difference, neither shadow that is cast by turning. Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.\" Himself a virgin, he teaches virginity in a mystery. Every perfect gift cometh down from above, where marriage is unknown; and it cometh down, not from any one you please, but from the Father of lights, Who says to the apostles, \"Ye are the light of the world;\" with Whom there is no difference of Jew, or Gentile, nor does that shadow which was the companion of the law, trouble those who have believed from among the nations; but with His word He begat us, and with the word of truth, because some shadow, image, and likeness of truth went before in the law, that we might be the first-fruits of His creatures. And as He who was Himself the[fn-64-P6469_2002714:298-nf] first begotten from the dead has raised all that have died in Him: so He who was a virgin, consecrated the first-fruits of His virgins in His own virgin self. Let us also consider what Peter thinks of the calling of the Gentiles:[fn-64-P6470_2002962:299-nf] \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.\" Where we read of an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, prepared in heaven and reserved for the last time, and of the hope of eternal life when they will neither marry, nor be given in marriage, there, in other words, the privileges of virginity are described. For he shows as much in what follows:[fn-64-P6471_2003701:300-nf] \"Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance; but like as he which called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living; because it is written, ye shall be holy; for I am holy.[fn-64-P6472_2004148:301-nf] For we were not redeemed with contemptible things, with silver or gold; but with the precious blood of a lamb without spot, Jesus Christ,[fn-64-P6473_2004321:302-nf] that we might purify our souls in obedience to the truth, having been begotten again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God,[fn-64-P6474_2004513:303-nf] who liveth and abideth. And as living stones let us be built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices through Christ our Lord.[fn-64-P6475_2004872:304-nf] For we are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.[fn-64-P6476_2004989:305-nf] Christ died for us in the flesh.

Great and precious are the promises attaching to virginity which He has given us,[fn-64-P6477_2005458:306-nf] that through it we may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust.[fn-64-P6478_2005610:307-nf] The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgement, but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion, daring, self-willed. For they, as beasts of burden, without reason, think only of their belly and their lusts, railers who shall in their corruption be destroyed, and shall receive the reward of iniquity: men that count unrighteousness delight, spots and blemishes, thinking of nothing but their pleasures; having eyes full of adultery and insatiable lust, deceiving souls not yet strengthened by the love of Christ. For they utter swelling words and easily snare the unlearned with the seduction of the flesh; promising them liberty while they themselves are the slaves of vice, luxury, and corruption. For of what a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage. But if, after they had escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again overcome by that which they before overcame, the last state is become worse with them than the first. And it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back and forsake the holy commandment delivered unto them. And it has happened unto them according to the true proverb, the dog hath turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.\" I have hesitated, for fear of being tedious, to quote the whole passage of the second Epistle of Peter, and have merely shown that the Holy Spirit in prophecy foretold the teachers of this time and their heresy.

'Do not thus reason with yourself, but with all your heart turn to the Lord and ask of Him without doubting, and you will know the multitude of His tender mercies; that He will never leave you, but fulfil the request of your soul. For He is not like men, who remember evils done against them; but He Himself remembers not evils, and has compassion on His own creature, Cleanse, therefore, your heart from all the vanities of this world, and from the words already mentioned, and ask of the Lord and you will receive all, and in none of your requests will you be denied which you make to the Lord without doubting. But if you doubt in your heart, you will receive none of your requests. For those who doubt regarding God are double-souled, and obtain not one of their requests.[fn-5-P570_117316:1-nf] But those who are perfect in faith ask everything, trusting in the Lord; and they obtain, because they ask nothing doubting, and not being double-souled. For every double-souled man, even if he repent, will with difficulty be saved.[fn-5-P571_117610:2-nf] Cleanse your heart, therefore, from all doubt, and put on faith, because it is strong, and trust God that you will obtain from Him all that you ask. And if at any time, after you have asked of the Lord, you are slower in obtaining your request [than you expected], do not doubt because you have not soon obtained the request of your soul; for invariably it is on account of some temptation or some sin of which you are ignorant that you are slower in obtaining your request. Wherefore do not cease to make the request of your soul, and you will obtain it. But if you grow weary and waver in your request, blame yourself, and not Him who does not give to you. Consider this doubting state of mind, for it is wicked and senseless, and turns many away entirely from the faith, even though they be very strong. For this doubting is the daughter of the devil, and acts exceedingly wickedly to the servants of God. Despise, then, doubting, and gain the mastery over it in everything; clothing yourself with faith, which is strong and powerful. For faith promises all things, perfects all things; but doubt having no thorough faith in itself, fails in every work which it undertakes. You see, then,\" says he, \"that, faith is from above-from the Lord[fn-5-P572_118921:3-nf] -and has great power; but doubt is an earthly spirit, coming from the devil, and has no power. Serve, then, that which has power, namely faith, and keep away from doubt, which has no power, and you will live to God.

But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice.

We ought, then, to object also to the Apostle James himself, who admonishes us in these words: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him; but let him ask in faith, nothing doubting.\"[fn-19-P1984_842857:43-nf] This is the faith to which the commandments drive us, in order that the law may prescribe our duty and faith accomplish it.[fn-19-P1985_843000:44-nf] For through the tongue, which no man can tame, but only the wisdom which comes down from above, \"in many things we all of us offend.\"[fn-19-P1986_843173:45-nf] For this truth also the same apostle pronounced in no other sense than that in which he afterwards declares: \"The tongue no man can tame.\"[fn-19-P1987_843330:46-nf] ","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"126","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He further treats of sins of ignorance, and says that \"a man ought to be very careful to avoid ignorance; and that ignorance is blame-worthy for this reason, because it is through his own neglect that a man is ignorant of that which he certainly must have known if he had only applied diligence;\" whereas he prefers disputing all things rather than to pray, and say: \"Give me understanding, that I may learn Thy commandments.\"[fn-19-P1997_845187:50-nf] It is, indeed, one thing to have taken no pains to know what sins of negligence were apparently expiated even through divers sacrifices of the law; it is another thing to wish to understand, to be unable, and then to act contrary to the law, through not understanding what it would have done.

For it is in his very will that he is guilty, whereby he would prefer, if it were possible, that what he dreads should not exist, in order that be might freely do what he secretly desires.

For certainly God did not in the actual achievement of the work first learn that it was good, but, on the contrary, nothing would have been made had it not been first known by Him. While, therefore, He sees that that is good which, had He not seen it before it was made, would never have been made, it is plain that He is not discovering, but teaching that it is good. Plato, indeed, was bold enough to say that, when the universe was completed, God was, as it were, elated with joy.[fn-18-P1895_1076308:48-nf] And Plato was not so foolish as to mean by this that God was rendered more blessed by the novelty of His creation; but he wished thus to indicate that the work now completed met with its Maker's approval, as it had while yet in design. It is not as if the knowledge of God were of various kinds, knowing in different ways things which as yet are not, things which are, and things which have been. For not in our fashion does He look forward to what is future, nor at what is present, nor back upon what is past; but in a manner quite different and far and profoundly remote from our way of thinking. For He does not pass from this to that by transition of thought, but beholds all things with absolute unchangeableness; so that of those things which emerge in time, the future, indeed, are not yet, and the present are now, and the past no longer are; but all of these are by Him comprehended in His stable and eternal presence. Nether does He see in one fashion by the eye, in another by the mind, for He is not composed of mind and body; nor does His present knowledge differ from that which it ever was or shall be, for those variations of time, past, present, and future, though they alter our knowledge, do not affect His, \"with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\"[fn-18-P1896_1077841:49-nf] Neither is there any growth from thought to thought in the conceptions of Him in whose spiritual vision all things which He knows are at once embraced. For as without any movement that time can measure. He Himself moves all temporal things, so He knows all times with a knowledge that time cannot measure. And therefore He saw that what He had made was good, when He saw that it was good to make it. And when He saw it made, He had not on that account a twofold nor any way increased knowledge of it; as if He had less knowledge before He made what He saw. For certainly He would not be the perfect worker He is, unless His knowledge were so perfect as to receive no addition from His finished works. Wherefore, if the only object had been to inform us who made the light, it had been enough to say, \"God made the light;\" and if further information regarding the means by which it was made had been intended, it would have sufficed to say, \"And God said, Let there be light, and there was light,\" that we might know not only that God had made the world, but also that He had made it by the word. But because it was right that three leading truths regarding the creature be intimated to us, viz., who made it, by what means, and why, it is written, \"God said, Let there be light, and there was light. And God saw the light that it was good.\" If, then, we ask who made it, it was \"God.\" If, by what means, He said \"Let it be,\" and it was. If we ask, why He made it, \"it was good.\" Neither is there any author more excellent than God, nor any skill more efficacious than the word of God, nor any cause better than that good might be created by the good God. This also Plato has assigned as the most sufficient reason for the creation of the world, that good works might be made by a good God;[fn-18-P1897_1079648:50-nf] whether he read this passage, or, perhaps, was informed of these things by those who had read them, or, by his quick-sighted genius, penetrated to things spiritual and invisible through the things that are created, or was instructed regarding them by those who had discerned them.

But even although Luke had said that Joseph was begotten by Heli, that expression ought not to disturb us to such an extent as to lead us to believe anything else than that by the one evangelist the father begetting was mentioned, and by the other the father adopting. For there is nothing absurd in saying that a person has begotten, not after the flesh, it may be, but in love, one whom he has adopted as a son. Those of us, to wit, to whom God has given power to become His sons, He did not beget of His own nature and substance, as was the case with His only Son; but He did indeed adopt us in His love. And this phrase the apostle is seen repeatedly to employ just in order to distinguish from us the only-begotten Son who is before every creature, by whom all things were made, who alone is begotten of the substance of the Father; who, in accordance with the equality of divinity, is absolutely what the Father is, and who is declared to have been sent with the view of assuming to Himself the flesh proper to that race to which we too belong according to our nature, in order that by His participation in our mortality, through His love for us, He might make us partakers of His own divinity in the way of adoption. For the apostle speaks thus: \"But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive[fn-13-P1372_550658:18-nf] the adoption of sons.\"[fn-13-P1373_550752:19-nf] And vet we are also said to be born of God,-that is to say, in so far as we, who already were men, have received power to be made the sons of God,-to be made such, moreover, by grace, and not by nature. For if we were sons by nature, we never could have been aught else. But when John said, \"To them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name,\" he proceeded at once to add these words, \"which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\"[fn-13-P1374_551292:20-nf] Thus, of the same persons he said, first, that having received power they became the sons of God, which is what is meant by that adoption which Paul mentions; and secondly, that they were born of God. And in order the more plainly to show by what grace this is effected, he continued thus: \"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,\"[fn-13-P1375_551654:21-nf] -as if he meant to say, What wonder is it that those should have been made sons of God, although they were flesh, on whose behalf the only Son was made flesh, although He was the Word? Howbeit there is this vast difference between the two cases, that when we are made the sons of God we are changed for the better; but when the Son of God was made the son of man, He was not indeed changed into the worse, but He did certainly assume to Himself what was below Him. James also speaks to this effect: \"Of His own will begat He us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits[fn-13-P1376_552262:22-nf] of His creatures.\"[fn-13-P1377_552306:23-nf] And to preclude our supposing, as it might appear from the use of this term \"begat,\" that we are made what He is Himself, he here points out very plainly, that what is conceded to us in virtue of this adoption, is a kind of headship[fn-13-P1378_552556:24-nf] among the creatures.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"187","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"71. Another question which it is also usual to put is this: How comes it that Matthew and Luke have stated that the Lord said to His disciples that they were not to take a staff with them, whereas Mark puts the matter in this way: \"And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only;\"[fn-17-P1788_731464:313-nf] and proceeds further in this strain, \"no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:\" thereby making it quite evident that his narrative belongs to the same place and circumstances with which the narratives of those others deal who have mentioned that the staff was not to be taken? Now this question admits of being solved on the principle of understanding that the staff which, according to Mark, was to be taken, bears one sense, and that the staff which,according to Matthew and Luke, was not to be taken with them, is to be interpreted in a different sense; just in the same way as we find the term \"temptation\" used in one meaning, when it is said, \"God tempteth no man,\"[fn-17-P1789_732347:314-nf] and in a different meaning where it is said, \"The Lord your God tempteth [proveth] you, to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-17-P1790_732484:315-nf] For in the former case the temptation of seduction is intended; but in the latter the temptation of probation. Another parallel occurs in the case of the term \"judgment,\" which must be taken in one way, where it is said, \"They that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment;\"[fn-17-P1791_732849:316-nf] and in another way, where it is said, \"Judge me, O God, and discern[fn-17-P1792_732945:317-nf] my cause, in respect of an ungodly nation.\"[fn-17-P1793_733006:318-nf] For the former refers to the judgment of damnation, and the latter to the judgment of discrimination.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"14.

All we therefore, who believe in the Living and True God, Whose Nature, being in the highest sense good and incapable of change, neither doth any evil, nor suffers any evil, from Whom is every good, even that which admits of decrease, and Who admits not at all of decrease in His own Good, Which is Himself, when we hear the Apostle saying, \"Walk in the Spirit, and perform ye not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: For these are opposed one to another, that ye do not what ye would.\"[fn-36-P3649_1722658:58-nf] Far be it from us to believe, what the madness of the Manichees believes, that there are here shown two natures or principles contrary one to another at strife, the one nature of good, the other of evil. Altogether these two are both good; both the Spirit is a good, and the flesh a good: and man, who is composed of both, one ruling, the other obeying, is assuredly a good, but a good capable of change, which yet could not be made save by a Good incapable of change, by Whom was created every good, whether small or great; but how small soever, yet made by What is Great; and how great soever, yet no way to be compared with the greatness of the Maker. But in this nature of man, that is good, and well formed and ordered by One That is Good, there is now war, since there is not yet health. Let the sickness be healed, there is peace. But that sickness fault hath deserved, not nature hath had. And this fault indeed through the layer of regeneration the grace of God hath already remitted unto the faithful; but under the hands of the same Physician nature as yet striveth with its sickness. But in such a conflict victory will be entire soundness; and that, soundness not for a time, but for ever: wherein not only this sickness is to come to an end, but also none to arise after it. Wherefore the just man addresseth his soul and saith, \"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His returns: Who becometh propitious to all thy iniquities, Who healeth all thy sicknesses.\"[fn-36-P3650_1724162:59-nf] He becometh propitious to our iniquities, when He pardons sins: He heals sicknesses when He restrains evil desires. He becometh propitious unto iniquities by the grant of forgiveness: He heals sicknesses, by the grant of continence. The one was done in Baptism to persons confessing; the other is done in the strife to persons contending; wherein through His help we are to overcome our disease. Even now the one is done, when we are heard, saying, \"Forgive us our debts;\"[fn-36-P3651_1724656:60-nf] but the other, when we are heard, saying, \"Lead us not into temptation. For every one is tempted,\" saith the Apostle James, \"being drawn away and enticed by his own lust.\"[fn-36-P3652_1724851:61-nf] And against this fault there is sought the help of medicine from Him, Who can heal all such sicknesses, not by the removal of a nature that is alien from us, but in the renewal of our own nature. Whence also the above-mentioned Apostle saith not, \"Every one is tempted\" by lust, but added, \"by his own:\" that he who hears this may understand, how he ought to cry, \"I said, Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-36-P3653_1725315:62-nf] For it would not have needed healing, had it not corrupted[fn-36-P3654_1725391:63-nf] itself by sinning, so that its own flesh should lust against it, that is, itself should be opposed to itself, on that side, wherein in the flesh it was made sick.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_33_of_holy_virginity_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"32. Wherefore a few witnesses, which the Lord deigns to suggest to my mind, I proceed to mention, from out the teaching of Christ concerning humility, such as perhaps may be enough for my purpose. His discourse, the first which He delivered to His disciples at greater length, began from this. \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"[fn-39-P3985_1894979:81-nf] And these without all controversy we take to be humble. The faith of that Centurion He on this account chiefly praised, and said that He had not found in Israel so great faith, because he believed with so great humility as to say, \"I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.\"[fn-39-P3986_1895286:82-nf] Whence also Matthew for no other reason said that he \"came\" unto Jesus, (whereas Luke most plainly signifies that he came not unto Him himself, but sent his friends,) save that by his most faithful humility he himself came unto Him more than they whom he sent. Whence also is that of the Prophet, \"The Lord is very high, and hath respect unto things that are lowly: but what are very high He noteth afar off;\"[fn-39-P3987_1895735:83-nf] assuredly as not coming unto Him. Whence also He saith to that woman of Canaan, \"O woman, great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou wilt;\"[fn-39-P3988_1895903:84-nf] whom above He had called a dog, and had made answer that the bread of the sons was not to be cast to her. And this she taking with humility had said, \"Even so, Lord; for the dogs also eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\" And thus what by continual crying she obtained not, by humble confession she earned.[fn-39-P3989_1896251:85-nf] Hence also those two are set forth praying in the Temple, the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican, for the sake of those who seem to themselves just and despise the rest of men, and the confession of sins is set before the reckoning up of merits. And assuredly the Pharisee was rendering thanks unto God by reason of those things wherein he was greatly self-satisfied. \"I render thanks to Thee,\" saith he, \"that I am not even as the rest of men, unjust, extortioners, adulterers, even as also this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things whatsoever I possess. But the Publican was standing afar off, not daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven, but beating his breast, saying, God be merciful unto me a sinner.\" But there follows the divine judgment, \"Verily I say unto you, the Publican went down from the Temple justified more than that Pharisee.\"[fn-39-P3990_1897144:86-nf] Then the cause is shown, why this is just; \"Forasmuch as he who exalteth himself shall be humbled, and whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.\" Therefore it may come to pass, that each one both shun real evils, and reflect on real goods in himself, and render thanks for these unto \"the Father of lights, from Whom cometh down every best gift, and every perfect gift,\"[fn-39-P3991_1897538:87-nf] and yet be rejected by reason of the sin of haughtiness, if through pride, even in his thought alone, which is before God, he insult other sinners, and specially when confessing their sins in prayer, unto whom is due not upbraiding with arrogance, but pity without despair. What is it that, when His disciples were questioning among themselves, who of them should be greater, He set a little child before their eyes, saying, \"Unless ye shall be as this child, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?\"[fn-39-P3992_1898064:88-nf] Did He not chiefly commend humility, and set in it the desert of greatness? Or when unto the sons of Zebedee desiring to be at His side in lofty seats He so made answer,[fn-39-P3993_1898257:89-nf] as that they should rather think of having to drink the Cup of His Passion, wherein He humbled Himself even unto death, even the death of the Cross,[fn-39-P3994_1898429:90-nf] than with proud desire demand to be preferred to the rest; what did He show, save, that He would be a bestower of exaltation upon them, who should first follow Him as a teacher of humility? And now, in that, when about to go forth unto His Passion, He washed the feet of His disciples, and most openly taught them to do for their fellow-disciples and fellow-servants this, which He their Lord and Master had done for them; how greatly did He commend humility?[fn-39-P3995_1898908:91-nf] And in order to commend this He chose also that time, wherein they were looking on Him, as immediately about to die, with great longing; assuredly about to retain in their memory this especially, which their Master, Whom they were to imitate, had pointed out to them as the last thing. But He did this at that time, which surely He could have done on other days also before, wherein He had been conversant with them; at which time if it were done, this same would indeed be delivered, but certainly would not be so received.","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_33_of_holy_virginity_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"43.

For both, whosoever continues chaste from the beginning, is ruled by Him; and whosoever is made chaste instead of unchaste, is corrected by Him; and whosoever is unchaste even unto the end, is abandoned by Him.

These things I am compelled to admonish by reason of certain little discourses of some men, that are to be shunned and avoided, which have begun to steal through the ears unto the minds of many, being (as must be said with tears) hostile to the grace of Christ, which go to persuade that we count not as necessary for us prayer unto the Lord, that we enter not into temptation. For they so essay to defend the free will of man, as that by it alone, even without help of the grace of God, we are able to fulfill what is commanded us of God. And thus it follows, that the Lord in vain said, \"Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation;\"[fn-42-P4202_1988878:49-nf] and in vain daily in the Lord's Prayer itself we say, \"Lead us not into temptation.\"[fn-42-P4203_1988984:50-nf] For if it is of our own power alone that we be not overcome by temptation, why do we pray that we enter not, nor be led into it? Rather let us do what is of our own free will, and most absolute power; and let us mock at the Apostle, saying, \"God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able;\"[fn-42-P4204_1989325:51-nf] and let us oppose him, and say, Why seek I of the Lord, what He hath set in my own power? But far be it, that he be so minded, who is sound minded. Wherefore let us seek that He may give, what He bids us that we have. For to this end He bids us have this, which as yet we have not, to admonish as what to seek; and that when we shall have found the power to do what He hath bidden, we may understand, of this also, whence we have received it; lest, being puffed and lifted up by the spirit of this world, we know not what things have been given unto us of God. Wherefore the free choice of the human will we by no means destroy, when the Grace of God, by which the free choice itself is helped, we deny not with ungrateful pride, but rather set forth with grateful piety. For it is ours to will: but the will itself is both admonished that it may arise, and healed, that it may have power;[fn-42-P4205_1990235:52-nf] and enlarged, that it may receive; and filled, that it may have. For were not we to will, certainly neither should we receive the things that are given, nor should we have. For who would have continence, (among the rest of the gifts of God to speak of this rather, of which I am speaking to you,) who, I say, would have continence, unless willing? forasmuch as also no one would receive unless willing. But if you ask, Whose gift it is, that it can be by our will received and had? listen to Scripture; yea, rather, because thou knowest, recollect what thou hast read, \"Whereas I knew,\" saith he, \"that no one can be continent, unless God give it, and this itself was of wisdom, to know whose gift it was.\"[fn-42-P4206_1990963:53-nf] Great are these two gifts, wisdom and continence; wisdom, forsooth, whereby we are formed in the knowledge of God; but continence, whereby we are not conformed unto this world. But God bids us that we be both wise and continent, without which goods we cannot be just and perfect. But let us praythat He give what He bids, by helping and inspiring, Who hath admonished us what to will by commanding and calling. Whatsoever 'of this He hath given, let us pray that He preserve; but what He hath not given as yet, let us pray that He supply; yet let us pray and give thanks for what we have received; and for what we have not yet received, from the very fact that we are not ungrateful for what we have received, let us trust that we shall receive it. For He, Who hath given power unto the faithful who are married to contain from adulteries and fornications, Himself hath given unto holy virgins and widows to contain from all sexual intercourse; in the case of which virtue now the term inviolate chastity[fn-42-P4207_1991989:54-nf] or continence is properly used. Or is it haply that from Him indeed we have received continence, but from ourselves have wisdom? \"What then is it that the Apostle James saith, \"But if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, Who giveth unto all liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given unto him.\"[fn-42-P4208_1992321:55-nf] But on this question, already in other little works of ours, so far as the Lord hath helped us, we have said many things; and at other times, so far as through Him we shall be able, when opportunity is given, we will speak.","title":"On the Good of Widowhood","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_34_on_the_good_of_widowhood","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"26. Therefore let spiritual delights succeed to the place of carnal delights in holy chastity; reading, prayer, psalm, good thought, frequency in good works, hope of the world to come, and a heart upward; and for all these giving of thanks unto the Father of lights, from Whom, without any doubt, every good gift, and every perfect gift, as Scripture bears witness, cometh down.[fn-42-P4227_2003475:69-nf] For when, in stead of tile delights of married women, which they have in the flesh of their husbands, the use of other carnal delights is taken, as it were to solace them, why should I speak of the evils which follow, when the Apostle hath said in short, that the widow, who lives in delights, living is dead.[fn-42-P4228_2003803:70-nf] But far be it from you, that ye be taken with lust of riches instead of lust of marriage, or that in your hearts money succeed to the place of love of a husband. For looking into men's conversation, we have often found by experience, that in certain persons, when wantonness hath been restrained, avarice hath increased. For, as, in the senses themselves of the body, they who see not hear more keenly, and discern many things by touch, nor have such as have the use of their eyes so great life in their touch; and in this instance it is understood that, when the exertion of the power of attention[fn-42-P4229_2004420:71-nf] hath been restrained in one approach, that is, of the eyes, it puts itself forth into other senses, more ready with keenness to distinguish, as though it essayed to supply from the one what was denied in the other; thus also often carnal lust, being restrained from pleasure of sensual intercourse, with greater strength reaches itself forth to desire money, and when turned away from the one, turns itself with more glow of passion to the other. But in you let the love of riches grow cold together with the love of marriage, and let a pious use of what property you possess be directed to spiritual delights, that your liberality wax warm rather in helping such as are in want than in enriching covetous persons. Forsooth into the heavenly treasury are sent not gifts to the covetous, but alms to the needy, which above measure help the prayers of widows. Fastings, also, and watchings, so far as they disturb not health, if they be spent in praying, singing psalms, reading, and meditating in the Law of God, even the very things which seem laborious are turned into spiritual delights. For no way burdensome are the labors of such as love, but even of themselves delight, as of such as hunt, fowl, fish, gather grapes, traffic, delight themselves with some game. It matters therefore what be loved. For, in the case of what is loved, either there is no labor, or the labor also is loved. And consider how it should be matter for shame and grief, if there be pleasure in labor, to take a wild beast, to fill cask and purse,[fn-42-P4230_2005966:72-nf] to cast a ball, and there be no pleasure in labors to win God!","title":"On the Good of Widowhood","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_29_lecture_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Wherefore putting away all filthiness, and all guile, and evil speaking[fn-28-P2894_823781:2-nf] , &c.","title":"Lecture XXIII.","author":"Cyril"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_29_lecture_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"17.

As for example, Judas having entered into the temptation of the love of money, swam not through it, but was overwhelmed and was strangled[fn-29-P2945_841889:36-nf] both in body and spirit. Peter entered into the temptation of the denial; but having entered, he was not overwhelmed by it, but manfully swam through it, and was delivered from the temptation[fn-29-P2946_842126:37-nf] . Listen again, in another place, to a company of unscathed saints, giving thanks for deliverance from temptation, Thou, O God hast prayed us; Thou hast tried us by, fire like as silver is tried. Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst afflictions upon our loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water; and thou broughtest us out into a place of rest[fn-29-P2947_842588:38-nf] . Thou seest them speaking boldly in regard to their having passed through and not been pierced[fn-29-P2948_842706:39-nf] . But Thou broughtest us out into a place of rest; now their coming into a place of rest is their being delivered from temptation.","title":"Lecture XXIII.","author":"Cyril"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But concerning that concupiscence of the flesh of which they speak, I believe that they are deceived, or that they deceive; for with this even he that is baptized must struggle with a pious mind, however carefully he presses forward, and is led by the Spirit of God. But although this is called sin, it is certainly so called not because it is sin, but because it is made by sin, as a writing is said to be some one's \"hand\" because the hand has written it. But they are sins which are unlawfully done, spoken, thought, according to the lust of the flesh, or to ignorance-things which, once done, keep their doers guilty if they are not forgiven. And this very concupiscence of the flesh is in such wise put away in baptism, that although it is inherited by all that are born, it in no respect hurts those that are born anew. And yet from these, if they carnally beget children, it is again derived; and again it will be hurtful to those that are born, unless by the same form it is remitted to them as born again, and remains in them in no way hindering the future life, because its guilt, derived by generation, has been put away by regeneration; and thus it is now no more sin, but is called so, whether because it became what it is by sin, or because it is stirred by the delight of sinning, although by the conquest of the delight of righteousness consent is not given to it. Nor is it on account of this, the guilt of which has already been taken away in the laver of regeneration, that the baptized say in their prayer, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors;\"[fn-51-P5170_2029744:64-nf] but on account of sins which are committed, whether in consentings to it, when what is right is overcome by that which pleases, or when by ignorance evil is accepted as if it were good.

From all which things what believer ever will boast that he has his heart pure? or who will boast that he is pure from sin?[fn-51-P5171_2030189:65-nf] Certainly that which follows in the prayer is said on account of concupiscence: \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" \"For every one,\" as it is written, \"is tempted when he is drawn away of his own concupiscence, and enticed; then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin.\"[fn-51-P5172_2030517:66-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_126_oration_on_the_psalms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-06","text":"VII. Let us look also at what follows. What says the most divine evangelist? When the Lord had entered into the temple, the blind and the lame came to Him; and He healed them. And when the chief priests and Pharisees saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,[fn-62-P6206_1909102:51-nf] they brooked not this honour that was paid Him, and therefore they came to Him, and thus spake, Hearest Thou not what these say? As if they said, Art Thou not grieved at hearing from these innocents things which befit God, and God alone? Has not God of old made it manifest by the prophet, \"My glory will I not give unto another; \"[fn-62-P6207_1909457:52-nf] and how dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God?[fn-62-P6208_1909526:53-nf] But what to this answers the long-suffering One, He who is abundant in mercy,[fn-62-P6209_1909621:54-nf] and slow to wrath?[fn-62-P6210_1909658:55-nf] He bears with these frenzied ones; with an apology He keeps their wrath in check; in His turn He calls the Scriptures to their remembrance; He brings forward testimony to what is done, and shrinks not from inquiry. Wherefore He says, Have ye never heard Me saying by the prophet, Then shall ye know that I am He that doth speak?[fn-62-P6211_1910004:56-nf] nor again, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger? Which without doubt are ye, who give heed unto the law, and read the prophets, while yet ye despise Me who, both by the law and the prophets, have been beforehand proclaimed. Ye think, indeed, under a pretence of piety, to avenge the glory of God, not understanding that he that despiseth Me despiseth My Father also.[fn-62-P6212_1910497:57-nf] I came forth from God, and am come into the world,[fn-62-P6213_1910566:58-nf] and My glory is the glory of My Father also. Even thus these foolish ones, being convinced by our Saviour-God, ceased to answer Him again, the truth stopping their mouths; but adopting a new and foolish device, they took counsel against Him. But let us sing, Great is our Lord, and great is His power;[fn-62-P6214_1910887:59-nf] and of His understanding there is no number. For all this was done that the Lamb and Son of God, that taketh away the sins of the world, might, of His own will, and for us, come to His saving Passion, and might be recognised, as it were, in the market and place of selling; and that those who bought Him might for thirty pieces of silver covenant for Him who, with His life-giving blood, was to redeem the world; and that Christ, our passover, might be sacrificed for us, in order that those who were sprinkled with His precious blood, and sealed on their lips, as the posts of the door,[fn-62-P6215_1911495:60-nf] might escape from the darts of the destroyer; and that Christ having thus suffered in the flesh, and having risen again the third day, might, with equal honour and glory with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be by all created things equally adored; for to Him every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth,[fn-62-P6216_1911863:61-nf] sending up glory to Him, for ever and ever.

No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all from a man's own will when he performs any act in accordance with God. Indeed, a work is then to be pronounced a good one when a person does it willingly; then, too, may the reward of a good work be hoped for from Him concerning whom it is written, \"He shall reward every man according to his works.\"[fn-59-P5931_2318743:37-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"It is concerning conjugal chastity itself that the apostle treats, when he says, \"Let him do what he will, he sinneth not if he marry;\"[fn-59-P5957_2326929:51-nf] and yet this too is God's gift, for the Scripture says, \"It is by the Lord that the woman is joined to her husband.\" Accordingly the teacher of the Gentiles, in one of his discourses, commends both conjugal chastity, whereby adulteries are prevented, and the still more perfect continence which foregoes all cohabitation, and shows how both one and the other are severally the gift of God. Writing to the Corinthians, he admonished married persons not to defraud each other; and then, after his admonition to these, he added: \"But I could wish that all men were even as I am myself,\"[fn-59-P5958_2327534:52-nf] -meaning, of course, that he abstained from all cohabitation; and then proceeded to say: \"But every man hath his own gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.\"[fn-59-P5959_2327732:53-nf] Now, do the many precepts which are written in the law of God, forbidding all fornication and adultery, indicate anything else than free will? Surely such precepts would not be given unless a man had a will of his own, wherewith to obey the divine commandments. And yet it is God's gift which is indispensable for the observance of the precepts of chastity. Accordingly, it is said in the Book of Wisdom: \"When I knew that no one could be continent, except God gives it, then this became a point of wisdom to know whose gift it was.\"[fn-59-P5960_2328286:54-nf] \"Every man,\" however, \"is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed\"[fn-59-P5961_2328393:55-nf] not to observe and keep these holy precepts of chastity. If he should say in respect of these commandments, \"I wish to keep them, but am mastered by my concupiscence,\" then the Scripture responds to his free will, as I have already said: \"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\"[fn-59-P5962_2328704:56-nf] In order, however, that this victory may be gained, grace renders its help; and were not this help given, then the law would be nothing but the strength of sin. For concupiscence is increased and receives greater energies from the prohibition of the law, unless the spirit of grace helps. This explains the statement of the great Teacher of the Gentiles, when he says, \"The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.\"[fn-59-P5963_2329157:57-nf] See, then, I pray you, whence originates this confession of weakness, when a man says, \"I desire to keep what the law commands, but am overcome by the strength of my concupiscence.\" And when his will is addressed, and it is said, \"Be not overcome of evil,\" of what avail is anything but the succour of God's grace to the accomplishment of the precept? This the apostle himself afterwards stated; for after saying \"The strength of sin is the law\" he immediately subjoined, \"But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-59-P5964_2329731:58-nf] It follows, then, that the victory in which sin is vanquished is nothing else than the gift of God, who in this contest helps free will.","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"When, however, the Pelagians say that the only grace which is not given according to our merits is that whereby his sins are forgiven to man, but that at which is given in the end, that is, eternal life, is rendered to our preceding merits: they must not be allowed to go without an answer. If, indeed, they so understand our merits as to acknowledge them, too, to be the gifts of God, then their opinion would not deserve reprobation. But inasmuch as they so preach human merits as to declare that a man has them of his own self, then most rightly the apostle replies: \"Who maketh thee to differ from another?

For I have received faith, which worketh by love, but I have not received perseverance therein to the end. Will any one dare to say that this perseverance is not the gift of God, and that so great a possession as this is ours in such wise that if any one have it the apostle could not say to him, `For what hast thou which thou hast not received?'[fn-63-P6385_2445187:35-nf] since he has this in such a manner as that he has not received it?\" To this, indeed, we are not able to deny, that perseverance in good, progressing even to the end, is also a great gift of God; and that it exists not save it comefrom Him of whom it is written, \"Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.\"[fn-63-P6386_2445563:36-nf] But the rebuke of him who has not persevered must not on that account be neglected, \"lest God perchance give unto him repentance, and he recover from the snares of the devil;\"[fn-63-P6387_2445756:37-nf] since to the usefulness of rebuke the apostle has subjoined this decision, saying, as I have above mentioned, \"Rebuking with moderation those that think differently, lest at any time God give them repentance.\"[fn-63-P6388_2445986:38-nf] For if we should say that such a perseverance, so laudable and so blessed, is man's in such wise as that he has it not from God, we first of all make void that which the Lord says to Peter: \"I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.\"[fn-63-P6389_2446246:39-nf] For what did He ask for him, but perseverance to the end? And assuredly, if a man could have this from man, it should not have been asked from God. Then when the apostle says, \"Now we pray to God that ye do no evil,\"[fn-63-P6390_2446483:40-nf] beyond a doubt he prays to God on their behalf for perseverance. For certainly he does not \"do no evil\" who forsakes good, and, not persevering in good, turns to the evil, from which he ought to turn aside.[fn-63-P6391_2446711:41-nf] In that place, moreover, where he says, \"I thank my God in every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making quest with joy for your fellowship[fn-63-P6392_2447232:42-nf] in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-63-P6393_2447438:43-nf] -what else does he promise to them from the mercy of God than perseverance in good to the end? And again where he says, \"Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant ofChrist Jesus, always striving for you in prayer, that you may stand perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God,\"[fn-63-P6394_2447753:44-nf] -what is \"that you may stand\" but \"that you may persevere\"?

And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the apostle, again, when he says, \"Now unto Him that is able to keep you without offence, and to establish you before the presence of His glory, immaculate in joy,\"[fn-63-P6396_2448294:46-nf] does he not most manifestly show that perseverance in good unto the end is God's gift? For what but a good perseverance does He give who preserves without offence that He may place before the presence of His glory immaculate in joy? What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: \"And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\"?[fn-63-P6397_2448741:47-nf] Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance? And when we read, \"He that shall persevere unto the end shall be saved;\"[fn-63-P6398_2448906:48-nf] with what salvation but eternal? And when, in the Lord's Prayer, we say to God the Father, \"Hallowed be Thy name,\"[fn-63-P6399_2449039:49-nf] what do we ask but that His name may be hallowed in us? And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: \"We say, 'Hallowed be Thy name,' not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because He said, 'Be ye holy, since I also am holy;'[fn-64-P6400_2449684:50-nf] we ask and entreat that we who have been hallowed in baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to be.\"[fn-64-P6401_2449838:51-nf] Behold the most glorious martyr is of this opinion, that what in these words Christ's faithful people are daily asking is, that they may persevere in that which they have begun to be.

But the dispensation as regards the Word of God, whereby He became man, both parties would perhaps equally reject, as being incredible and unfitting to be told of God. By starting, therefore, from another point we will bring these gainsayers to a belief in this fact. They believe that all things came into being by thought and skill on the part of Him Who framed the system of the universe; or else they hold views that do not conform to this opinion. But should they not grant that reason and wisdom guided the framing of the world, they will install unreason and unskilfulness on the throne of the universe. But if this is an absurdity and impiety, it is abundantly plain that they must allow that thought and skill rule the world. Now in what has been previously said, the Word of God has been shown not to be this actual utterance of speech, or the possession of some science or art, but to be a power essentially and substantially existing, willing all good, and being possessed of strength to execute all its will; and, of a world that is good, this power appetitive and creative of good is the cause. If, then, the subsistence of the whole world has been made to depend on the power of the Word, as the train of the argument has shown, an absolute necessity prevents us entertaining the thought of there being any other cause of the organization of the several parts of the world than the Word Himself, through whom all things in it passed into being. If any one wants to call Him Word, or Skill, or Power, or God, or anything else that is high and prized, we will not quarrel with him. For whatever word or name be invented as descriptive of the subject, one thing is intended by the expressions, namely the eternal power of God which is creative of things that are, the discoverer of things that are not, the sustaining cause of things that are brought into being, the foreseeing cause of things yet to be. This, then, whether it be God, or Word, or Skill, or Power, has been shown by inference to be the Maker of the nature of man, not urged to framing him by any necessity, but in the superabundance of love operating the production of such a creature. For needful it was that neither His light should be unseen, nor His glory without witness, nor His goodness unenjoyed, nor that any other quality observed in the Divine nature should in any case lie idle, with none to share it or enjoy it. If, therefore, man comes to his birth upon these conditions, namely to be a partaker of the good things in God, necessarily he is framed of such a kind as to be adapted to the participation of such good. For as the eye, by virtue of the bright ray which is by nature wrapped up in it, is in fellowship with the light, and by its innate capacity draws to itself that which is akin to it, so was it needful that a certain affinity with the Divine should be mingled with the nature of man, in order that by means of this correspondence it might aim at that which was native to it. It is thus even with the nature of the unreasoning creatures, whose lot is cast in water or in air; each of them has an organization adapted to its kind of life, so that by a peculiar formation of the body, to the one of them the air, to the other the water, is its proper and congenial element. Thus, then, it was needful for man, born for the enjoyment of Divine good, to have something in his nature akin to that in which he is to participate. For this end he has been furnished with life, with thought, with skill, and with all the excellences that we attribute to God, in order that by each of them he might have his desire set upon that which is not strange to him. Since, then, one of the excellences connected with the Divine nature is also eternal existence, it was altogether needful that the equipment of our nature should not be without the further gift of this attribute, but should have in itself the immortal, that by its inherent faculty it might both recognize what is above it, and be possessed with a desire for the divine and eternal life[fn-38-P3868_2539577:20-nf] . In truth this has been shown in the comprehensive utterance of one expression, in the description of the cosmogony, where it is said that man was made \"in the image of God\"[fn-38-P3869_2540034:21-nf] . For in this likeness, implied in the word image, there is a summary of all things that characterize Deity; and whatever else Moses relates, in a style more in the way of history, of these matters, placing doctrines before us in the form of a story, is connected with the same instruction. For that Paradise of his, with its peculiar fruits, the eating of which did not afford to them who tasted thereof satisfaction of the appetite, but knowledge and eternity of life, is in entire agreement with what has been previously considered with regard to man, in the view that our nature at its beginnings was good, and in the midst of good. But, perhaps, what has been said will be contradicted by one who looks only to the present condition of things, and thinks to convict our statement of untruthfulness, inasmuch as man is seen no longer under those primeval circumstances, but under almost entirely opposite ones. \"Where is the divine resemblance in the soul? Where the body's freedom from suffering? Where the eternity of life? Man is of brief existence, subject to passions, liable to decay, and ready both in body and mind for every form of suffering.\" By these and the like assertions, and by directing the attack against human nature, the opponent will think that he upsets the account that has been offered respecting man. But to secure that our argument may not have to be diverted from its course at any future stage, we will briefly discuss these points. That the life of man is at present subject to abnormal conditions is no proof that man was not created in the midst of good. For since man is the work of God, Who through His goodness brought this creature into being, no one could reasonably suspect that he, of whose constitution goodness is the cause, was created by his Maker in the midst of evil. But there is another reason for our present circumstances being what they are, and for our being destitute of the primitive surroundings: and yet again the starting-point of our answer to this argument against us is not beyond and outside the assent of our opponents. For He who made man for the participation of His own peculiar good, and incorporated in him the instincts for all that was excellent, in order that his desire might be carried forward by a corresponding movement in each case to its like, would never have deprived him of that most excellent and precious of all goods; I mean the gift implied in being his own master, and having a free will. For if necessity in any way was the master of the life of man, the \"image\" would have been falsified in that particular part, by being estranged owing to this unlikeness to its archetype. How can that nature which is under a yoke and bondage to any kind of necessity be called an image of a Master Being? Was it not, then, most right that that which is in every detail made like the Divine should possess in its nature a self-ruling and independent principle, such as to enable the participation of good to be the reward of its virtue? Whence, then, comes it, you will ask, that he who had been distinguished throughout with most excellent endowments exchanged these good things for the worse? The reason of this also is plain. No growth of evil had its beginning in the Divine will. Vice would have been blameless were it inscribed with the name of God as its maker and father. But the evil is, in some way or other, engendered[fn-38-P3870_2543454:22-nf] from within, springing up in the will at that moment when there is a retrocession of the soul from the beautiful[fn-38-P3871_2543617:23-nf] , For as sight is an activity of nature, and blindness a deprivation of that natural operation, such is the kind of opposition between virtue and vice. It is, in fact, not possible to form any other notion of the origin of vice than as the absence of virtue. For as when the light has been removed the darkness supervenes, but as long as it is present there is no darkness, so, as long as the good is present in the nature, vice is a thing that has no inherent existence; while the departure of the better state becomes the origin of its opposite. Since then, this is the peculiarity of the possession of a free will, that it chooses as it likes the thing that pleases it, you will find that it is not God Who is the author of the present evils, seeing that He has ordered your nature so as to be its own master and free; but rather the recklessness that makes choice of the worse in preference to the better.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But, on the other hand, \"of his own will a man forsakes God, so as to be deservedly forsaken\nby God.\" Who would deny this?

Remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at the ignorance of thy neighbour. Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins. For a furious man will kindle strife, and a sinful man will disquiet friends, and will make debate among them that be at peace. For according to the trees of the wood, so will the fire burn; and according as a man's strength is, so will his wrath be; and according to his riches, his anger will rise. An hasty contention will kindle a fire; and an hasty fighting will shed blood; and a tale-bearing (testificans) tongue will cause death. If thou blow the spark, it shall burn like a fire; and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched; and both these come out of thy mouth. The whisperer and double- tongued is cursed; for he has destroyed many that were at peace. A backbiting (tertia) tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation. Strong cities of the rich hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It has destroyed the strength of peoples, and has scattered strong nations. A backbiting tongue hath east out virtuous women (viratas, spirited), and deprived them of their labours. Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and shall never have a friend on whom he may repose. The stroke of the whip maketh marks; but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from the evil tongue, and hath not passed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands. For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. The death thereof is an evil death, and the grave were better than it. Its endurance shall not abide, but it shall possess the ways of the unrighteous. In its flame it shall not burn the righteous. Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. Hedge thine ears (soe pi aures) about with thorns, and refuse to listen to the evil tongue, and make a door for thy mouth and bars for thine ears. Smelt (confla) thy gold and thy silver, and make a balance for thy words, and a right bridle for thy mouth.

But if thou bewrayest his secrets, thou shalt follow no more after him. For as a man who destroyeth his friend, so is he that loseth the love of his neighbour. And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so art thou who hast let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he is as a roe escaped out of the snare, since his soul is wounded. Further thou wilt not be able to bind him up, and after reviling there may be reconcilement; but to bewray the secrets of a friend is the despair of an unhappy mind. He that winketh with the eye worketh evil, and every one will cast him off. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words. But at last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him; and the Lord will hate him. Whoso casteth a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds in the deceiver. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that placeth a stone in his neighbour's way shall stumble thereon; and he that setteth a trap for another shall perish in it. He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him; and he shall not know whence it cometh on him. Mockery and reproach are from the proud; and vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die. Wrath and fury are both abominations, and the sinful man shall have them both.\"[fn-92-P9289_3027003:6-nf] \"He that desireth to be avenged shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep his sins in remembrance. Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done thee; so shall thy sins also be forgiven thee when thou prayest. One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord? He showeth no mercy to a man which is like himself, and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins from the Most High? He, though he is but flesh, nourishes hatred; and does he implore mercy from God? Who will entreat for pardon of his sins? Remember thy end, and let enmity cease. For corruption and death impend on His commandments. Remember the fear of God, and bear no malice to thy neighbour. Remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at the ignorance of thy neighbour. Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins. For a furious man will kindle strife, and a sinful man will disquiet friends, and will make debate among them that be at peace. For according to the trees of the wood, so will the fire burn; and according as a man's strength is, so will his wrath be; and according to his riches, his anger will rise. An hasty contention will kindle a fire; and an hasty fighting will shed blood; and a tale-bearing (testificans) tongue will cause death. If thou blow the spark, it shall burn like a fire; and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched; and both these come out of thy mouth. The whisperer and double- tongued is cursed; for he has destroyed many that were at peace. A backbiting (tertia) tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation. Strong cities of the rich hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It has destroyed the strength of peoples, and has scattered strong nations. A backbiting tongue hath east out virtuous women (viratas, spirited), and deprived them of their labours. Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and shall never have a friend on whom he may repose. The stroke of the whip maketh marks; but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from the evil tongue, and hath not passed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands. For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. The death thereof is an evil death, and the grave were better than it. Its endurance shall not abide, but it shall possess the ways of the unrighteous. In its flame it shall not burn the righteous. Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. Hedge thine ears (soe pi aures) about with thorns, and refuse to listen to the evil tongue, and make a door for thy mouth and bars for thine ears. Smelt (confla) thy gold and thy silver, and make a balance for thy words, and a right bridle for thy mouth. And beware lest thou slide perchance in thy tongue, and fall in the sight of thine enemies that be in wait for thee, and thy fall be irremediable unto death.\"[fn-92-P9290_3030201:7-nf] Let all beware of these things, and \"keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\"[fn-92-P9291_3030319:8-nf] \"Finally, dearly beloved, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. Put on the armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil; for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places (coelestibus). Wherefore take unto you the armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and to stand perfect in all (omnibus perfecti). Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; in all (in omnibus) taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\"[fn-92-P9292_3031225:9-nf] It is our wish, brother, that those things which we have written to you should be made known generally to all, in order that things which touch the others should be made known to all.

So also because it is said: \"Without Him was made nothing,\" since nothing is assuredly not anything, when it is truly and properly spoken, it makes no difference whether it be said: \"Without Him was made nothing or Without Him nothing was made,\" or \"nothing was made.\" But who cares to speak with men who can say of this very expression of mine \"It makes no difference,\" \"Therefore it makes some difference, for nothing itself is something?\" But those whose brains are not addled, see it as a thing most manifest that this something is to be understood when it says \"It makes no difference,\" as when I say \"It matters in no respect.\" But these, if they should say to any one, \"What hast thou done?\" and he should reply that he has done nothing, would, according to this mode of disputation, falsely accuse him saying, \"Thou hast done something, therefore, because thou hast done nothing; for nothing is itself something.\" But they have also the Lord Himself placing this word at the end of a sentence, when He says: \"And in secret have I spoken nothing.\"[fn-26-P2654_1582025:17-nf] Let them read, therefore, and be silent.[fn-26-P2655_1582087:18-nf] ","title":"Concerning the Nature of Good, Against the Manichaeans.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_51_on_prayer_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For the completeness of so brief a prayer He added-in order that we should supplicate not touching the remitting merely, but touching the entire averting, of acts of guilt\" Lead us not into temptation: \"that is, suffer us not to be led into it, by him (of course) who tempts; but far be the thought that the Lord should seem to tempt,[fn-118-P11842_3317931:57-nf] as if He either were ignorant of the faith of any, or else were eager to overthrow it.

For when men sleep, the enemy sows the material of tares;[fn-90-P9017_2599689:67-nf] and for this cause did the Lord command His disciples to be on the watch.[fn-90-P9018_2599784:68-nf] And again, those persons who are not bringing forth the fruits of righteousness, and are, as it were, covered over and lost among brambles, if they use diligence, and receive the word of God as a graft,[fn-90-P9019_2600032:69-nf] arrive at the pristine nature of man-that which was created after the image and likeness of God.","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_34_de_decretis_or_defence_of_the_nicene_definition","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4.

And supposing, even after subscription, Eusebius and his fellows did change again, and return like dogs to their own vomit of irreligion, do not the present gain-sayers deserve still greater detestation, because they thus sacrifice[fn-32-P3224_1267878:23-nf] their souls' liberty to others; and are willing to take these persons as masters of their heresy, who are, as James[fn-32-P3225_1268029:24-nf] has said, double-minded men, and unstable in all their ways, not having one opinion, but changing to and fro, and now recommending certain statements, but soon dishonouring them, and in turn recommending what just now they were blaming?

For \"every man is tempted of his own lust. Then lust when it has conceived beareth sin, and sin when it is consummated begets death.\"[fn-41-P4104_1511974:3-nf] For the first Adam could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had material food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second Adam be tempted without the enticement of some object, when it was said to Him: \"If Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-41-P4105_1512297:4-nf] And it is clear to everybody that fornication also is only completedby a bodily act, as God says of this spirit to the blessed Job: \"And his force is in his loins, and his strength in the navel of his belly.\"[fn-41-P4106_1512525:5-nf] And so these two faults in particular, which are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh, especially require bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the soul; since the determination of the mind is not in itself enough to resist their attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess or the other passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome without any mortification of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be used as well, and be carried out by means of fasting and vigils and acts of contrition; and to this must be added change of scene, because since these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can only be overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the blessed Apostle says generallythat all faults are carnal, since he enumerates enmities and anger and heresies among other works of the flesh,[fn-41-P4107_1513412:6-nf] yet in order to cure them and to discover their nature more exactly we make a twofold division of them: for we call some of them carnal, and some spiritual. And those we call carnal, which specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the flesh, and with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it excites the mind when at rest and even drags it against its will to consent to its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle says: \"In which also we all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.\"[fn-41-P4108_1514056:7-nf] But we call those spiritual which spring only from the impulse of the mind andnot merely contribute no pleasure to the flesh, but actually bring on it a weakness that is harmful to it, and only feed a diseased mind with the food of a most miserable pleasure. And therefore these need a single medicine for the heart: but those which are carnal can only be cured, as we said, by a double remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for those who aspire to purity, to begin by withdrawing from themselves the material which feeds these carnal passions, through which opportunity for or recollection of these same desires can arise in a soul that is still affected by the evil. For a complicated disease needs a complicated remedy. For from the body the object and material which would allure it must be withdrawn, for fear lest the lust should endeavour to break out into act; and before the mind we should no less carefully place diligent meditation on Scripture and watchful anxiety and the withdrawal into solitude, lest it should give birth to desire even in thought. But as regards other faults intercourse with our fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of the greatest possible use, to those who truly desire to get rid of them, because in mixing with others they more often meet with rebuke, and while they are more frequently provoked the existence of the faults is made evident, and so they are cured with speedy remedies.","title":"V.

For neither can the husbandman, when he has spent the utmost pains in cultivating the ground, forthwith ascribe the produce of the crops and the rich fruits to his own exertions, as he finds that these are often in vain unless opportune rains and a quiet and calm winter aids them, so that we have often seen fruits already ripe and set and thoroughly matured snatched as it were from the hands of those who were grasping them; and their continuous and earnest efforts were of no use to the workers because they were not under the guidance of the Lord's assistance. As then the Divine goodness does not grant these rich crops to idle husbandmen who do not till their fields by frequent ploughing, so also toil all night long is of no use to the workers unless the mercy of the Lord prospers it. But herein human pride should never try to put itself on a level with the grace of God or to intermingle itself with it, so as to fancy that its own efforts were the cause of Divine bounty, or to boast that a very plentiful crop of fruits was an answer to the merits of its own exertions. For a man should consider and with a most careful scrutiny weigh the fact that he could not by his own strength apply those very efforts which he has earnestly used in his desire for wealth, unless the Lord's protection and pity had given him strength for the performance of all agricultural labours; and that his own will and strength would have been powerless unless Divine compassion had supplied the means for the completion of them, as they sometimes fail either from too much or from too little rain. For when vigour has been granted by the Lord to the oxen, and bodily health and the power to do all the work, and prosperity in undertakings, still a man must pray lest there come to him, as Scripture says, \"a heaven of brass and an earth of iron,\" and \"the cankerworm eat what the locust hath left, and the palmerworm eat what the cankerworm hath left, and the mildew destroys what the palmerworm hath left.\"[fn-52-P5255_1889831:2-nf] Nor is it only in this that the efforts of the husbandman in his work need God's help, unless it also averts unlooked for accidents by which, even when the field is rich with the expected fruitful crops, not only is the man deprived of what he has vainly hoped and looked for, but actually loses the abundant fruits which he has already gathered and stored up in the threshing floor or in the barn. From which we clearly infer that the initiative not only of our actions but also of good thoughts comes from God, who inspires us with a good will to begin with, and supplies us with the opportunity of carrying out what we rightly desire: for \"every good gift and every perfect gift cometh down from above, from the Father of lights,\"[fn-52-P5256_1890597:3-nf] who both begins what is good, and continues it and completes it in us, as the Apostle says: \"But He who giveth seed to the sower will both provide bread to eat and will multiply your seed and make the fruits of your righteousness to increase.\"[fn-52-P5257_1890860:4-nf] But it is for us, humbly to follow day by day the grace of God which is drawing us, or else if we resist with \"a stiff neck,\" and (to use the words of Scripture) \"uncircumcised ears,\"[fn-52-P5258_1891062:5-nf] we shall deserve to hear the words of Jeremiah: \"Shall he that falleth, not rise again? and he that is turned away, shall he not turn again?

For without this that theoretical purity of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only,-who are perfected not by the words of others who teach them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after much expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their knowledge not from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing with the Psalmist: \"From Thy commandments I have understanding;\" and having overcome all their passions, they say with confidence: \"I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.\"[fn-54-P5496_1967282:22-nf] For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm, understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart a holy tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge yourselves from the stain of all sins, and rid yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an impossibility for the soul which is taken up even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of knowledge or to become an author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading holy things. Be careful therefore in the first place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather to be careful about what I am going to say-that you may enjoin absolute silence on your lips, in order that your zeal for reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed by vain pride. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them. For from teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of spiritual knowledge will flourish. And so you should never venture to say anything in the conference of the Elders unless some ignorance that might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to know leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory, pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the knowledge which they perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the praise of men, to be rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one who is bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults, and especially to that of pride: and so if he is baffled by his enCounter with practical and ethical knowledge, he will certainly not attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be then in all things \"swift to hear, but slow to speak,\"[fn-54-P5497_1969421:23-nf] lest there come upon you that which is noted by Solomon: \"If thou seest a man who is quick to speak, know that there is more hope of a fool than of him;[fn-54-P5498_1969595:24-nf] and do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not already performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we ought to keep to this order, as of Him it is said: \"what Jesus began to do and to teach.\"[fn-54-P5499_1969853:25-nf] Take care then that you do not rush into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those of whom the Lord speaks inthe gospel to the disciples: \"What they sayunto you, that observe and do, but not aftertheir words: for they say and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to beborne, and lay them on men's shoulders; butthey themselves will not move them with oneof their fingers.\"[fn-55-P5500_1970280:26-nf] For if he who shall \"breakone of these commands, and shall teach menso, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-55-P5501_1970428:27-nf] it follows that one who has dared to despise many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall certainly be considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest in the punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul on profound and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of man's, nor condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of the illumination of the Holy Ghost.","title":"XIV.

For after he had said that God justifieth man by faith, he grapples with the Law again. And he does not say, where then are the well doings. of the Jews? where their righteous dealing? but, \"where is then the boasting?\" so taking every opportunity of showing, that they do but use great words, as though they had somewhat more than others, and have no work to show. And after saying, \"Where then is the boasting?\" he does not say, it is put out of sight and hath come to an end, but \"it is excluded,\" which word rather expresses unseasonableness; since the reason for it is no more. For as when the judgment is come they that would repent have not any longer the season for it, thus now the sentence being henceforth passed, and all being upon the point of perishing, and He being at hand Who by grace would break these terrors, they had no longer the season for making a plea of amelioration wrought by the Law. For if it were right to strengthen themselves upon these things, it should have been before His coming. But now that He who should save by faith was come, the season for those efforts[fn-22-P2240_2186104:14-nf] was taken from them. For since all were convicted, He therefore saveth by grace. And this is why He is come but now, that they may not say, as they would had He come at the first, that it was possible to be saved by the Law and by our own labors and well-doings. To curb therefore this their effrontery, He waited a long time: so that after they were by every argument clearly convicted of inability to help themselves, He then saved them by His grace. And for this reason too when he had said above, \"To declare His righteousness,\" he added, \"at this time.\" If any then were to gainsay, they do the same as if a person who after committing great sins was unable to defend himself in court, but was condemned and going to be punished, and then being by the royal pardon forgiven, should have the effrontery after his forgiveness to boast and say that he had done no sin. For before the pardon came, was the time to prove it: but after it came he would no longer have the season for boasting. And this happened in the Jews' case. For since they had been traitors to themselves, this was why He came, by His very coming doing away their boasting. For he who saith that he is a \"teacher of babes, and maketh his boast in the Law,\" and styles himself \"an instructor of the foolish,\" if alike with them he needed a teacher and a Saviour, can no longer have any pretext for boasting. For if even before this, the circumcision was made uncircumcision, much rather was it now, since it is cast out from both periods. But after saying that \"it was excluded,\" he shows also, how. How then does he say it was excluded? \"By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith.\" See he calls the faith also a law delighting to keep to the names, and so allay the seeming novelty. But what is the \"law of faith?\" It is, being saved by grace.

For since they had been traitors to themselves, this was why He came, by His very coming doing away their boasting. For he who saith that he is a \"teacher of babes, and maketh his boast in the Law,\" and styles himself \"an instructor of the foolish,\" if alike with them he needed a teacher and a Saviour, can no longer have any pretext for boasting. For if even before this, the circumcision was made uncircumcision, much rather was it now, since it is cast out from both periods. But after saying that \"it was excluded,\" he shows also, how. How then does he say it was excluded? \"By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith.\" See he calls the faith also a law delighting to keep to the names, and so allay the seeming novelty. But what is the \"law of faith?\" It is, being saved by grace. Here he shows God's power, in that He has not only saved, but has even justified, and led them to boasting,[fn-22-P2241_2188067:15-nf] and this too without needing works, but looking for faith only. And in saying this he attempts to bring the Jew who has believed to act with moderation, and to calm him that hath not believed, in such way as to draw him on to his own view. For he that has been saved, if he be high-minded in that he abides by the Law, will be told that he himself has stopped his own mouth, himself has accused himself, himself has renounced claims to his own salvation, and has excluded boasting. But he that hath not believed again, being humbled by these same means, will be capable of being brought over to the faith. Do you see how great faith's preaeminence is? How it hath removed us from the former things, not even allowing us to boast of them?","title":"Homily VII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_34_part_ii_containing_epistles_or_fragments_of_epistles_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-06","text":"I.

For it will seek no external support from anything, if it has the internal support of the virtue of humility, its mother and its guardian. But if we are disturbed when attacked by anyone it is clear that the foundations of humility have not been securely laid in us, and therefore at the outbreak even of a small storm, our whole edifice is shaken and ruinously disturbed. For patience would not be worthy of praise and admiration if it only preserved its purposed tranquillity when attacked by no darts of enemies, but it is grand and glorious because when the storms of temptation beat upon it, it remains unmoved. For wherein it is believed that a man is annoyed and hurt by adversity, therein is he strengthened the more; and he is therein the more exercised, wherein he is thought to be annoyed. For everybody knows that patience gets its name from the passions and endurance, and so it is clear that no one can be called patient but one who bears without annoyance all the indignities offered to him, and so it is not without reason that he is praised by Solomon: \"Better is the patient man than the strong, and he who restrains his anger than he who takes a city;\" and again: \"For a long-suffering man is mighty in prudence, but a faint-hearted man is very foolish.\"[fn-60-P6092_2163046:16-nf] When then anyone is overcome by a wrong, and blazes up in a fire of anger, we should not hold that the bitterness of the insult offered to him is the cause of his sin, but rather the manifestation of secret weakness, in accordance with the parable of our Lord and Saviour which He spoke about the two houses,[fn-60-P6093_2163384:17-nf] one of which was founded upon a rock, and the other upon the sand, on both of which He says that the tempest of rain and waters and storm beat equally: but that one which was founded on the solid rock felt no harm at all from the violence of the shock, while that which was built on the shifting and moving sand at once collapsed. And it certainly appears that it fell, not because it was struck by the rush of the storms and torrents. but because it was imprudently built upon the sand. For a saint does not differ from a sinner in this, that he is not himself tempted in the same way, but because he is not worsted even by a great assault, while the other is overcome even by a slight temptation. For the fortitude of any good man would not, as we said, be worthy of praise, if his victory was gained without his being tempted, as most certainly there is no room for victory where there is no struggle and conflict: for \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he has been proved he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love Him.\"[fn-60-P6094_2164494:18-nf] According to the Apostle Paul also \"Strength is made perfect\" not in ease and delights but \"in weakness.\" \"For behold,\" says He, \"I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, and to the princes thereof, and to the priests thereof, and to all the people of the land.

For He adds, \"The Lord will deliver him out of them all.\" And this is just in accordance with the Saviour's word, whereby He promises that they will overcome their afflictions, and that they will participate in that victory which He has won for them. For after saying, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation,\" He added, \"But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" And again, He taught them to pray that they might not fall into temptation, when He said, \"And lead us not into temptation; \"which means, \"Suffer us not to fall into temptation.\" And to show that this did not imply they should not be tempted, but really that they should be delivered from the evil, He added, \"But deliver us from evil.\" But perhaps you will say, What difference is there between being tempted, and falling or entering into temptation?

For the Son of God indeed, being Himself the Word, is Lord of all; but we once were subject from the first to the slavery of corruption and the curse of the Law, then by degrees fashioning for ourselves things that were not, we served, as says the blessed Apostle, `them which by nature are no Gods[fn-58-P5894_2352927:76-nf] ,' and, ignorant of the true God, we preferred things that were not to the truth; but afterwards, as the ancient people when oppressed in Egypt groaned, so, when we too had the Law `engrafted[fn-58-P5895_2353136:77-nf] ' in us, and according to the unutterable sighings[fn-58-P5896_2353205:78-nf] of the Spirit made our intercession, `O Lord our God, take possession of us[fn-58-P5897_2353301:79-nf] ,' then, as `He became for a house of refuge' and a `God and defence,' so also He became our Lord. Nor did He then begin to be, but we began to have Him for our Lord. For upon this, God being good and Father of the Lord, in pity, and desiring to be known by all, makes His own Son put on Him a human body and become man, and be called Jesus, that in this body offering Himself for all, He might deliver all from false worship and corruption, and might Himself become of all Lord and King. His becoming therefore in this way Lord and King, this it is that Peter means by, `He hath made Him Lord,' and `hath sent Christ;' as much as to say, that the Father in making Him man (for to be made belongs to man), did not simply make Him man, but has made Him in order to His being Lord of all men, and to His hallowing all through the Anointing. For though the Word existing in the form of God took a servant's form, yet the assumption of the flesh did not make a servant[fn-58-P5898_2354290:80-nf] of the Word, who was by nature Lord; but rather, not only was it that emancipation of all humanity which takes place by the Word, but that very Word who was by nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by means of a servant's form been made Lord of all and Christ, that is, in order to hallow all by the Spirit. And as God, when `becoming a God and defence,' and saying, `I will be a God to them,' does not then become God more than before, nor then begins to become God, but, what He ever is, that He then becomes to those who need Him, when it pleaseth Him, so Christ also being by nature Lord and King everlasting, does not become Lord more than He was at the time He is sent forth, nor then begins to be Lord and King, but what He is ever, that He then is made according to the flesh; and, having redeemed all, He becomes thereby again Lord of quick and dead. For Him henceforth do all things serve, and this is David's meaning in the Psalm, `The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool[fn-58-P5899_2355618:81-nf] .'

Therefore if He be other than all things, as has been above shewn[fn-70-P7019_2788070:439-nf] , and through Him the works rather came to be, let not `by will' be applied to Him, or He has similarly come to be as the things consist which through Him come to be. For Paul, whereas he was not before, became afterwards an Apostle `by the will of God[fn-70-P7020_2788345:440-nf] ;' and our own calling, as itself once not being, but now taking place afterwards, is preceded by will, and, as Paul himself says again, has been made `according to the good pleasure of His will[fn-70-P7021_2788564:441-nf] .' And what Moses relates, `Let there be light,' and `Let the earth appear,' and `Let Us make man,' is, I think, according to what has gone before[fn-70-P7022_2788729:442-nf] , significant of the will of the Agent. For things which once were not but happened afterwards from external causes, these the Framer counsels to make; but His own Word begotten from Him by nature, concerning Him He did not counsel beforehand; for in Him the Father makes, in Him frames, other things whatever He counsels; as also James the Apostle teaches, saying, `Of His own will begat He us with the Word of truth[fn-70-P7023_2789167:443-nf] .' Therefore the Will of God concerning all things, whether they be begotten again or are brought into being at the first, is in His Word, in whom He both makes and begets again what seems right to Him; as the Apostle[fn-70-P7024_2789405:444-nf] again signifies, writing to Thessalonica; `for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.' But if, in whom He makes, in Him also is the will, and in Christ is the pleasure of the Father, how can He, as others, come into being by will and pleasure? For if He too came to be as you maintain, by will, it follows that the will concerning Him consists in some other Word, through whom He in turn comes to be; for it has been shewn that God's will is not in the things which He brings into being, but in Him through whom and in whom all things made are brought to be. Next, since it is all one to say `By will' and Once He was not,' let them make up their minds to say, `Once He was not,' that, perceiving with shame that times are signified by the latter, they may understand that to say `by will' is to place times before the Son; for counselling goes before things which once were not, as in the case of all creatures. But if the Word is the Framer of the creatures, and He coexists with the Father, how can to counsel precede the Everlasting as if He were not? for if counsel precedes, how through Him are all things? For rather He too, as one among others is by will begotten to be a Son, as we too were made sons by the Word of Truth; and it rests, as was said, to seek another Word, through whom He too has come to be, and was begotten together with all things, which were according to God's pleasure.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_69_to_the_bishops_of_africa","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Once more, let them say whether things originate could say[fn-78-P7894_3156153:46-nf] , `all things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.' Now, He has the prerogative of creating and making, of Eternity, of omnipotence, of immutability. But things originate cannot have the power of making, for they are creatures; nor eternity, for their existence has a beginning; nor of omnipotence and immutability, for they are under sway, and of changeable nature, as the Scriptures say. Well then, if these prerogatives belong to the Son, they clearly do so, not on account of His virtue, as said above, but essentially, even as the synod said, `He is of no other essence' but of the Father's, to whom these prerogatives are proper. But what can that be which is proper to the Father's essence, and an offspring from it, or what name can we give it, save `coessential?' For that which a man sees in the Father, that sees he also in the Son; and that not by participation, but essentially. And this is [the meaning of] `I and the Father are one,' and `he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.' Here especially once more it is easy to shew their folly. If it is from virtue, the antecedent of willing and not willing, and of moral progress, that you hold the Son to be like the Father; while these things fall under the category of quality; clearly you call God compound of quality and essence. But who will tolerate you when you say this? For God, who compounded all things to give them being, is not compound, nor of similar nature to the things made by Him through the Word. Far be the thought. For He is simple essence, in which quality is not, nor, as James says, `any variableness or shadow of turning[fn-78-P7895_3157784:47-nf] .' Accordingly, if it is shewn that it is not from virtue (for in God there is no quality, neither is there in the Son), then He must be proper to God's essence. And this you will certainly admit if mental apprehension is not utterly destroyed in you. But what is that which is proper to and identical with the essence of God, and an Offspring from it by nature, if not by this very fact coessential with Him that begat it?

I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore. Amen.parparpar","title":"Homily XXXII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_96_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Who is there then to pray over us, since Paul hath departed?

For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing\nand being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I\nlove Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its\ngreatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its\nwealth, and for its successes in war. But I let all this pass, and esteem it blessed on this account,\nthat both in his lifetime he wrote to them, and loved them so, and talked with them whiles he was\nwith us, and brought his life to a close there.[fn-34-P3465_3146056:9-nf] Wherefore the city is more notable upon this\nground, than upon all others together. And as a body great and strong, it hath as two glistening eyes\nthe bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the\ncity of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be\ncaught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (fricate) at\nthe thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together\nwith Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. (1 Thess. iv. 17.) What a rose will Rome send up to\nChrist! (Is. xxxv. 1) what two crowns will the city have about it! what golden chains will she be\ngirded with! what fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, not for the\ncolumns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the Church. (1 Cor. xv. 38.) Would\nthat it were now given me to throw myself round (perixuqhnai) the body of\nPaul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that \"filled up that which was\nlacking\" after \"Christ\" Col. i. 24), that bore \"the marks\" (stigmata,)\n(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and\nfro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more\nbrilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!\nthrough which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, \"I could wish that myself were accursed, for my\nbrethren\" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake \"before kings, and was not ashamed!\" (Ps. cxix. 46)\nthrough which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the\nthunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much\nmore did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop\nto diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding[fn-34-P3466_3148144:10-nf] upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and\nwhat the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon\nPaul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys.

For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels.

For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore. Amen.parparpar","title":"Homily XXXII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_96_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Who is there then to pray over us, since Paul hath departed?

Only let us yield\nourselves worthy of such intercession (sunhgoriaj), that it may not be\nthat we hear Paul's voice here only, but that hereafter, when we are departed, we may be counted\nworthy to see the wrestler of Christ.[fn-34-P3462_3142363:6-nf] Or\nrather, if we hear him here, we shall certainly see him hereafter, if not as standing near him, yet\nsee him we certainly shall, glistening near the Throne of the king.[fn-34-P3463_3142728:7-nf] Where the Cherubim sing the glory, where the\nSeraphim are flying, there shall we see Paul, with Peter, and as a chief[fn-34-P3464_3143013:8-nf] and leader of the choir of the Saints, and shall\nenjoy his generous love. For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing\nand being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I\nlove Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its\ngreatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its\nwealth, and for its successes in war. But I let all this pass, and esteem it blessed on this account,\nthat both in his lifetime he wrote to them, and loved them so, and talked with them whiles he was\nwith us, and brought his life to a close there.[fn-34-P3465_3146056:9-nf] Wherefore the city is more notable upon this\nground, than upon all others together. And as a body great and strong, it hath as two glistening eyes\nthe bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the\ncity of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be\ncaught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (fricate) at\nthe thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together\nwith Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. (1 Thess. iv. 17.) What a rose will Rome send up to\nChrist! (Is. xxxv. 1) what two crowns will the city have about it! what golden chains will she be\ngirded with! what fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, not for the\ncolumns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the Church. (1 Cor. xv. 38.) Would\nthat it were now given me to throw myself round (perixuqhnai) the body of\nPaul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that \"filled up that which was\nlacking\" after \"Christ\" Col. i. 24), that bore \"the marks\" (stigmata,)\n(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and\nfro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more\nbrilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!\nthrough which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, \"I could wish that myself were accursed, for my\nbrethren\" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake \"before kings, and was not ashamed!\" (Ps. cxix. 46)\nthrough which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the\nthunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much\nmore did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop\nto diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding[fn-34-P3466_3148144:10-nf] upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and\nwhat the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon\nPaul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore.

This, I suppose, is looked for from me, this I promise, by the Lord's assistance, to explain as well as I can. For without doubt it is not without a meaning, that those miracles were done, and something they figured out to us bearing on eternal saving[fn-59-P5926_2508835:1-nf] health. For the health of the body which was restored to this man, of how long duration was it? \"For what is your life?\" saith Holy Scripture; \"it is a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.\"[fn-59-P5927_2509164:2-nf] Therefore in that health was restored to this man's body for a time, some enduringness was restored to a vapour. So then this is not to be valued much; \"Vain is the health of man.\"[fn-59-P5928_2509361:3-nf] And, brethren, recollect that Prophetical and Evangelical testimony, for it is read in the Gospel; \"All flesh is grass, and all the glory of flesh as the flower of grass; the grass withereth, the flower falleth away, the Word of the Lord endureth for ever.\"[fn-59-P5929_2509634:4-nf] The Word of the Lord communicateth glory even to the grass, and no transitory glory; for even to flesh He giveth immortality.","title":"Sermon LXXIV.

Now what does this mean, my beloved, but that we also, when the enemies are arrayed against us, should glory in afflictions[fn-94-P9465_3421925:29-nf] , and that when we are persecuted, we should not be discouraged, but should the rather press after the crown of the high calling[fn-94-P9466_3422098:30-nf] in Christ Jesus our Lord? and that being insulted, we should not be disturbed, but should give our cheek to the smiter, and bow the shoulder? For the lovers of pleasure and the lovers of enmity are tried, as saith the blessed Apostle James, `when they are drawn away by their own lusts and enticed[fn-94-P9467_3422414:31-nf] .' But let us, knowing that we suffer for the truth, and that those who deny the Lord smite and persecute us, `count it all joy, my brethren,' according to the words of James, `when we fall into trials of various temptations, knowing that the trial of our faith worketh patience[fn-94-P9468_3422708:32-nf] .' Let us rejoice as we keep the feast, my brethren, knowing that our salvation is ordered in the time of affliction. For our Saviour did not redeem us by inactivity, but by suffering for us He abolished death. And respecting this, He intimidated to us before, saying, `In the world ye shall have tribulation[fn-94-P9469_3423036:33-nf] .' But He did not say this to every man, but to those who diligently and faithfully perform good service to Him, knowing beforehand, that they should be persecuted who would live godly toward Him.","title":"Letter XIII.

Therefore, as the Apostle James saith, \"Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak.\"[fn-24-P2444_1464663:15-nf] As it is also said by another manof God, \"Thou wilt make me to hear joy and gladness; and the bones Thou hast humbled will rejoice.\"[fn-24-P2445_1464813:16-nf] This is what I said: When the truth is heard, humility is preserved. And another says: \"But the friend of the bridegroom standeth and heareth him, and rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.\"[fn-24-P2446_1465034:17-nf] Let us rejoice in the hearing that comes from the noiseless speaking of the truth within us. For although, when the sound is outwardly uttered, as by one that readeth; or proclaimeth, or preacheth, or disputeth, or commandeth, or comforteth, or exhorteth, or even by one that sings or accompanies hisvoice on an instrument, those who do so may fear to defile their feet, when they aim at pleasing men with the secretly active desire of human applause. Yet the one who hears such with a willing and pious mind, has no room for self-gratulation in the labors of others; and with no self-inflation, but with the joy of humility, rejoices because of the Master's words of truth. Accordingly, in those who hear with willingness and humility, and spend a tranquil life in sweet and wholesome studies, the holy Church will take delight, and may say, \"I sleep, andmy heart waketh.\" And what is this, \"I sleep, and my heart waketh,\" but just I sit down quietly to listen? My leisure is not laid out in nourishing slothfulness, but in acquiring wisdom. \"I sleep, and my heart waketh.\" I am still, and see that Thou art the Lord:[fn-24-P2447_1466173:18-nf] for \"the wisdom of the scribe cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that hath little business shall become wise.\"[fn-24-P2448_1466309:19-nf] \"I sleep, and my heart waketh:\" I rest from troublesome business, and my mind turns its attention to divine concerns (or communications).[fn-24-P2449_1466473:20-nf] ","title":"Tractate LVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_197_sermon_xlix_on_lent_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"And so, tha the malice of the fretting foe may effect nothing by its rage, a keener devotion must be awaked to the performance of the Divine commands, in order that we may enter on the season, when all the mysteries of the Divine mercy meet together, with preparedness both of mind and body, invoking the guidance and help of God, that we may be strong to fulfil all things through Him, without Whom we can do nothing. For the injunction is laid on us, in order that we may seek the aid of Him Who lays it Nor must any one excuse himself by reason of his weakness, since He Who has granted the will, also gives the power, as the blessed Apostle James says, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, Who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him[fn-34-P3476_866214:9-nf] .\" Which of the faithful does not know what virtues he ought to cultivate, and what vices to fight against? Who is so partial or so unskilled a judge of his own conscience as not to know what ought to be removed, and what ought to be developed? Surely no one is so devoid of reason as not to understand the character of his mode of life, or not to know the secrets of his heart. Let him not then please himself in everything, nor judge himself according to the delights of the flesh, but place his every habit in the scale of the Divine commands, where, some things being ordered to be done and others forbidden, he can examine himself in a true balance by weighing the actions of his life according to this standard. For the designing mercy of God[fn-34-P3477_866982:10-nf] has set up the brightest mirror in His commandments, wherein a man may see his mind's face and realize its conformity or dissimilarity to God's image: with the specific purpose that, at least, during the days of our Redemption and Restoration, we may throw off awhile our carnal cares and restless occupations, and betake ourselves from earthly matters to heavenly.","title":"Sermon XLIX.

And when he had distributed the rods,[fn-60-P6029_1773878:22-nf] and the dove came forth out of none of them, the high priest put on the twelve bells[fn-60-P6030_1774026:23-nf] and the sacerdotal robe; and entering into the holy of holies, he there made a burnt-offering, and poured forth a prayer. And the angel of the Lord appeared to him, saying: There is here the shortest rod, of which thou hast made no account: thou didst bring it in with the rest, but didst not take it out with them. When thou hast taken it out, and hast given it him whose it is, in it will appear the sign of which I spoke to thee. Now that was Joseph's rod; and because he was an old man, he had been cast off, as it were, that he might not receive her, but neither did he himself wish to ask back his rod.[fn-60-P6031_1774661:24-nf] And when he was humbly standing last of all, the high priest cried out to him with a loud voice, saying: Come, Joseph, and receive thy rod; for we are waiting for thee. And Joseph came up trembling, because the high priest had called him with a very loud voice. But as soon as he stretched forth his hand, and laid hold of his rod, immediately from the top of it came forth a dove whiter than snow, beautiful exceedingly, which, after long flying about the roofs of the temple, at length flew towards the heavens. Then all the people congratulated the old man, saying: Thou hast been made blessed in thine old age, O father Joseph, seeing that God hath shown thee to be fit to receive Mary. And the priests having said to him, Take her, because of all the tribe of Judah thou alone hast been chosen by God; Joseph began bashfully to address them, saying: I am an old man, and have children; why do you hand over to me this infant, who is younger than my grandsons? Then Abiathar the high priest said to him: Remember, Joseph, how Dathan and Abiron and Core perished, because they despised the will of God. So will it happen to thee, if thou despise this which is commanded thee by God. Joseph answered him: I indeed do not despise the will of God; but I shall be her guardian until I can ascertain concerning the will of God, as to which of my sons can have her as his wife. Let some virgins of her companions, with whom she may meanwhile spend her time, be given for a consolation to her. Abiathar the high priest answered and said: Five virgins indeed shall be given her for consolation, until the appointed day come in which thou mayst receive her; for to no other can she be joined in marriage.","title":"The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_240_letter_ccxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"The letter of your reverences came upon me in an hour affliction like water poured into the mouths of racehorses, inhaling dust with each eager breath at high noontide in the middle of the course. Beset by trial after trial, I breathed again, at once cheered by your words and invigorated by the thought of your struggles to meet that which is before me with unflinching courage. For the conflagration which has devoured a great part of the East is already advancing by slow degrees into our own neighbourhood, and after burning everything round about us is trying to reach even the Churches in Cappadocia, already moved to tears by the smoke that rises from the ruins of our neighbours' homes.[fn-52-P5292_1654969:3-nf] The flames have almost reached me. May the Lord divert them by the breath of His mouth, and stay this wicked fire. Who is such a coward, so unmanly, so untried in the athlete's struggles, as not to be nerved to the fight by your cheers, and pray to be hailed victor at your side? You have been the first to step into the arena of true religion; you have beaten off many an attack in bouts with the heretics; you have borne the strong hot wind[fn-52-P5293_1656163:4-nf] of trial, both you who are leaders of the Church, to whom has been the ministry of the altar, and every individual of the laity, including those of higher rank. For this in you is specially admirable and worthy of all praise, that you are all one in the Lord. some of you leaders in the march to what is good, others willingly following. It is for this reason that you are too strong for the attack of your assailants, and allow no hold to your antagonists in any one of your members, wherefore day and night I pray the King of the ages to preserve the people in the integrity of their faith, and for them to preserve the clergy, like a head unharmed at the top, exercising its own watchful forethought for every portion of the body underneath. For while the eyes discharge their functions, the hands can do their work as they ought, the feet can move without tripping, and no part of the body is deprived of due care. I beseech you, then, to cling to one another, as you are doing and as you will do. I beseech you who are entrusted with the care of souls to keep each and all together, and to cherish them like beloved children. I beseech the people to continue to show you the respect and honour due to fathers, that in the goodly order of your Church you may keep your strength and the foundation of your faith in Christ; that God's name may be glorified and the good gift of love increase and abound. May I, as I hear of you, rejoice in your progress in God. If I am still bidden to sojourn in the flesh in this world, may I one day see you in the peace of God. If I be now summoned to depart this life, may I see you in the radiant glory of the saints, together with all them who are accounted worthy through patience and showing forth of good works, with crowns upon your heads.","title":"Letter CCXXII.","author":"St. Basil"}]
