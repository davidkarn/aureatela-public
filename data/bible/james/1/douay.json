{"verses":["James, the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the\ntwelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.","My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers\ntemptations:","Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience","And patience hath a perfect work:  that you may be perfect and\nentire, failing in nothing.","But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to\nall men abundantly and upbraideth not.  And it shall be given him.","But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.  For he that wavereth\nis like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the\nwind.","Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing\nof the Lord.","A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.","But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:","And the rich, in his being low:  because as the flower of the\ngrass shall he pass away.","For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass:  and\nthe flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof\nperished.  So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.","Blessed is the man that endureth temptation:  for, when he hath\nbeen proved, he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised\nto them that love him.","Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God.\nFor God is not a tempter of evils:  and he tempteth no man.","But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn\naway and allured.","Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.\nBut sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.","Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.","Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down\nfrom the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of\nalteration.","For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth,\nthat we might be some beginning of his creature.","You know, my dearest brethren.  And let every man be swift to\nhear, but slow to speak and slow to anger.","For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.","Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of\nnaughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to\nsave your souls.","But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your\nown selves.","For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be\ncompared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.","For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what\nmanner of man he was.","But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath\ncontinued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the\nwork:  this man shall be blessed in his deed.","And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his\ntongue but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain.","Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this:\nto visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep\none's self unspotted from this world."]}
