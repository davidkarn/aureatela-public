It is now time to return to the four virtues, and to draw out and prescribe a way of life in conformity with them, taking each separately. First, then, let us consider temperance, which promises us a kind of integrity and incorruption in the love by which we are united to God. The office of temperance is in restraining and quieting the passions which make us pant for those things which turn us away from the laws of God and from the enjoyment of His goodness, that is, in a word, from the happy life. For there is the abode of truth; and in enjoying its contemplation, and in cleaving closely to it, we are assuredly happy; but departing from this, men become entangled in great errors and sorrows. For, as the apostle says, \"The root of all evils is covetousness; which some having followed, have made shipwreck of the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\"[fn-4-P428_192254:51-nf] And this sin of the soul is quite plainly, to those rightly understanding, set forth in the Old Testament in the transgression of Adam in Paradise.

As for that which the apostle says, \"And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him:\" either the text has been so turned, lest any one should think that the \"fashion\"[fn-2-P259_90359:59-nf] of Christ, which He took according to the human creature, was to be transformed hereafter into the Divinity, or (to express it more precisely) the Godhead itself, who is not a creature, but is the unity of the Trinity,-a nature incorporeal, and unchangeable, and consubstantial, and co-eternal with itself; or if any one contends, as some have thought, that the text, \"Then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him,\" is so turned in order that one may believe that very \"subjection\" to be a change and conversion hereafter of the creature into the substance or essence itself of the Creator, that is, that that which had been the substance of a creature shall become the substance of the Creator;-such an one at any rate admits this, of which in truth there is no possible doubt, that this had not yet taken place, when the Lord said, \"My Father is greater than I.\" For He said this not only before He ascended into heaven, but also before He had suffered, and had risen from the dead. But they who think that the human nature in Him is to be changed and converted into the substance of the Godhead, and that it was so said, \"Then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him,\"-as if to say, Then also the Son of man Himself, and the human nature taken by the Word of God, shall be changed into the nature of Him who put all things under Him,-must also think that this will then take place, when, after the day of judgment, \"He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father.\" And hence even still, according to this opinion, the Father is greater than that form of a servant which was taken of the Virgin. But if some affirm even further, that the man Christ Jesus has already been changed into the substance of God, at least they cannot deny that the human nature still remained, when He said before His passion, \"For my Father is greater than I;\" whence there is no question that it was said in this sense, that the Father is greater than the form of a servant, to whom in the form of God the Son is equal. Nor let any one, hearing what the apostle says, \"But when He saith all things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted which did put all things under Him,\"[fn-2-P260_92634:60-nf] think the words, that He hath put all things under the Son, to be so understood of the Father, as that He should not think that the Son Himself put all things under Himself. For this the apostle plainly declares, when he says to the Philippians, \"For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue[fn-2-P261_93154:61-nf] all things unto Himself.\"[fn-2-P262_93196:62-nf] For the working of the Father and of the Son is indivisible. Otherwise, neither hath the Father Himself put all things under Himself, but the Son hath put all things under Him, who delivers the kingdom to Him, and puts down all rule and all authority and power. For these words are spoken of the Son: \"When He shall have delivered up,\" says the apostle, \"the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He shall have put down[fn-2-P263_93640:63-nf] all rule, and all authority, and all power.\" For the same that puts down, also makes subject.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"16. Neither may we think that Christ shall so give up the kingdom to God, even the Father, as that He shall take it away from Himself. For some vain talkers have thought even this. For when it is said, \"He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father,\" He Himself is not excluded; cause He is one God together with the Father. But that word \"until\" deceives those who are careless readers of the divine Scriptures, but eager for controversies. For the text continues, \"For He must reign, until He hath put all enemies under His feet;\"[fn-2-P265_94301:64-nf] as though, when He had so put them, He would no more reign. Neither do they perceive that this is said in the same way as that other text, \"His heart is established: He shall not be afraid, until He see His desire upon His enemies.\"[fn-2-P266_94558:65-nf] For He will not then be afraid when He has seen it. What then means, \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father,\" as though God and the Father has not the kingdom now? But because He is hereafter to bring all the just, over whom now, living by faith, the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, reigns, to that sight which the same apostle calls \"face to face;\"[fn-2-P267_94976:66-nf] therefore the words, \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father,\" are as much as to say, When He shall have brought believers to the contemplation of God, even the Father.

For He signifies this in that which He says: \"I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.\"[fn-3-P311_109177:101-nf] Mary, sitting at the feet of the Lord, and earnestly listening to His word, foreshowed a similitude of this joy; resting as she did from all business, and intent upon the truth, according to that manner of which this life is capable, by which, however, to prefigure that which shall be for eternity. For while Martha, her sister, was cumbered about necessary business, which, although good and useful, yet, when rest shall have succeeded, is to pass away, she herself was resting in the word of the Lord. And so the Lord replied to Martha, when she complained that her sister did not help her: \"Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall not be taken away from her.\"[fn-3-P312_109866:102-nf] He did not say that Martha was acting a bad part; but that \"best part that shall not be taken away.\" For that part which is occupied in the ministering to a need shall be \"taken away\" when the need itself has passed away. Since the reward of a good work that will pass away is rest that will not pass away. In that contemplation, therefore, God will be all in all; because nothing else but Himself will be required, but it will be sufficient to be enlightened by and to enjoy Him alone. And so he in whom \"the Spirit maketh intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered,\"[fn-3-P313_110466:103-nf] says, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to contemplate the beauty of the Lord.\"[fn-3-P314_110664:104-nf] For we shall then contemplate God, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, when the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, so as no longer to make intercession for us, as our Mediator and Priest, Son of God and Son of man;[fn-3-P315_110986:105-nf] but that He Himself too, in so far as He is a Priest that has taken the form of a servant for us, shall be put under Him who has put all things under Him, and under whom He has put all things: so that, in so far as He is God. He with Him will have put us under Himself; in so far as He is a Priest, He with us will be put under Him.[fn-3-P316_112148:106-nf] And therefore as the [incarnate] Son is both God and man, it is rather to be said that the manhood in the Son is another substance [from the Son], than that the Son in the Father [is another substance from the Father]; just as the carnal nature of my soul is more another substance in relation to my soul itself, although in one and the same man, than the soul of another man is in relation to my soul.[fn-3-P317_112577:107-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"28.

For that \"taking\" was such as to make God man, and man God. Yet what is said on account of what, and what according to what, the thoughtful, diligent, and pious reader discerns for himself, the Lord being his helper. For instance, we have said that He glorifies His own, as being God, and certainly then as being the Lord of glory; and yet the Lord of glory was crucified, because even God is rightly said to have been crucified, not after the power of the divinity, but after the weakness of the flesh:[fn-3-P389_135355:165-nf] just as we say, that He judges as God, that is, by divine power, not by human; and yet the man Himself will judge, just as the Lord of glory was crucified: for soHe expressly says, \"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, and before Him shall be gathered all nations;\"[fn-3-P390_135686:166-nf] and the rest that is foretold of the future judgment in that place even to the last sentence.

But there is a sight of that form of mine, in which when I was, I thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but in order to take this form I emptied myself.[fn-4-P416_148519:189-nf] That one God, therefore, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, who will not appear, except for joy which cannot be taken away from the just; for which future joy he sighs, who says, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord:\"[fn-4-P417_148895:190-nf] that one God, therefore, Himself, I say, is alone good, for this reason, that no one sees Him for sorrow and wailing, but only for salvation and true joy.

If thou art amongthose who \"shall look upon Him whom they have pierced,\"[fn-4-P418_149279:191-nf] that very sight itself will be evil to them, because it will be penal. That after this meaning, then, the Lord said, \"Why askest thou me about good? there is none good but One, that is, God,\" is probable upon those proofs which I have alleged, because that sight of God, whereby we shall contemplate the substance of God unchangeable and invisible to human eyes (which is promised to the saints alone; which the Apostle Paul speaks of, as \"face to face;\"[fn-4-P419_149756:192-nf] and of which the Apostle John says, \"We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;\"[fn-4-P420_149871:193-nf] and of which it is said, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord,\" and of which the Lord Himself says, \"I will both love him, and will manifest myself to him;\"[fn-4-P421_150093:194-nf] and on account of which alone we cleanse our hearts by faith, that we may be those \"pure in heart who are blessed for they shall see God:\"[fn-4-P422_150253:195-nf] and whatever else is spoken of that sight: which whosoever turns the eye of love to seek it, may find most copiously scattered through all the Scriptures),-that sight alone, I say, is our chief good, for the attaining of which we are directed to do whatever we do aright. But that sight of the Son of man which is foretold, when all nations shall be gathered before Him, and shall say to Him, \"Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or thirsty, etc.?\" will neither be a good to the ungodly, who shall be sent into everlasting fire, nor the chief good to the righteous. For He still goes on to call these to the kingdom which has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world. For, as He will say to those, \"Depart into everlasting fire;\" so to these,\" Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.\" And as those will go into everlasting burning; so the righteous will go into life eternal. But what is life eternal, except \"that they may know Thee,\" He says, \"the One true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent?\"[fn-4-P423_151320:196-nf] but know Him now in that glory of which He says to the Father, \"Which I had with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-4-P424_151459:197-nf] For then He will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,[fn-4-P425_151547:198-nf] that the good servant may enter into the joy of his Lord,[fn-4-P426_151627:199-nf] and that He may hide those whom God keeps in the hiding of His countenance from the confusion of men, namely, of those men who shall then be confounded by hearing this sentence; of which evil hearing \"the righteous man shall not be afraid\"[fn-4-P427_151893:200-nf] if only he be kept in \"the tabernacle,\" that is, in the true faith of the Catholic Church, from \"the strife of tongues,\"[fn-4-P428_152034:201-nf] that is, from the sophistries of heretics. But if there is any other explanation of the words of the Lord, where He says, \"Why asketh thou me about good? there is none good, but One, that is, God;\" provided only that the substance of the Father be not therefore believed to be of greater goodness than that of the Son, according to which He is the Word by whom all things were made; and if there is nothing in it abhorrent from sound doctrine; let us securely use it, and not one explanation only, but as many as we are able to find. For so much the more powerfully are the heretics proved wrong, the more outlets are open for avoiding their snares.

Nor can virtue, since it is difficult in itself, be esteemed as a good in any other way than by having its hardship compensated by the greatest good. We can in no other way equally abstain from these present goods, than if there are other greater goods on account of which it is worth while to leave the pursuit of pleasures, and to endure all evils. But these are no other, as I have shown in the third book,[fn-22-P2200_893734:68-nf] than the goods of everlasting life. Now who can bestow these except God, who has proposed to us virtue itself? Therefore the sum and substance of everything is contained in the acknowledging and worship of God; all the hope and safety of man centres in this; this is the first step of wisdom, to know who is our true Father, and to worship Him alone with the piety which is due to Him, to obey Him, to yield ourselves to His service with the utmost devotedness: let our entire acting, and care, and attention, be laid out in gaining His favour.[fn-22-P2201_894313:69-nf] ","title":"Book VI.

But now, with respect to paying the uttermost farthing,[fn-3-P363_92372:95-nf] it may be understood without absurdity either as standing for this, that nothing is left unpunished; just as in common speech we also say \"to the very dregs,\" when we wish to express that something is so drained out that nothing is left: or by the expression \"the uttermost farthing\" earthly sins may be meant. For as a fourth part of the separate component parts of this world, and in fact as the last, the earth is found; so that you begin with the heavens, you reckon the air the second, water the third, the earth the fourth. It may therefore seem to be suitably said, \"till thou hast paid the last fourth,\" in the sense of \"till thou hast expiated thy earthly sins:\" for this the sinner also heard, \"Earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return.\"[fn-3-P364_93266:96-nf] Then, as to the expression \"till thou hast paid,\" I wonder if it does not mean that punishment which is called eternal.[fn-3-P365_93405:97-nf] For whence is that debt paid where there is now no opportunity given of repenting and of leading a more correct life?

Hence, as it is there understood of Him respecting whom it is said, \"He must reign, till He hath put His enemies under His feet\" that He will reign for ever, inasmuch as they will be for ever under His feet: so here it may be understood of him respecting whom itis said, \"Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing,\" that he will never come out; for he is always paying the uttermost farthing, so long as he is suffering the everlasting punishment of his earthly sins.

Therefore, if I were to ask any good Christian who has a wife, and even though he may still be having children by her, whether he would like to have his wife in that kingdom; mindful in any case of the promises of God, and of that life where this incorruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality;[fn-4-P423_118152:136-nf] though at present hesitating from the greatness, or at least from a certain degree of love, he would reply with execration that he is strongly averse to it. Were I to ask him again, whether he would like his wife to live with him there, after the resurrection, when she had undergone that angelic change which is promised to the saints, he would reply that he desired this as strongly as he reprobated the other. Thus a good Christian is found in one and the same woman to love the creature of God, whom he desires to be transformed and renewed; but to hate the corruptible and mortal conjugal connection and sexual intercourse: i.e. to love in her what is characteristic of a human being, to hate what belongs to her as a wife. So also he loves his enemy, not in as far as he is an enemy, but in as far as he is a man; so that he wishes the same prosperity to come to him as to himself, viz. that he may reach the kingdom of heaven rectified and renewed. This isto be understood both of father and mother and the other ties of blood, that we hate in them what has fallen to the lot of the human race in being born and dying, but that we love what can be carried along with us to those realms where no one says, My Father; but all say to the one God, \"Our Father:\" and no one says, My mother; but all say to that other Jerusalem, Our mother: and no one says, My brother; but each says respecting every other, Our brother. But in fact there will be a marriage on our part as of one spouse (when we have been brought together into unity), with Him who hath delivered us from the pollution of this world by the shedding of His own blood.

Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more[fn-4-P455_143027:154-nf] than these cometh of evil.\" The righteousness of the Pharisees is not to forswear oneself; and this is confirmed by Him who gives the command not to swear, so far as relates to the righteousness of the kingdom of heaven. For just as he who does not speak at all cannot speak falsely, so he who does not swear at all cannot swear falsely. But yet, since he who takes God to witness swears, this section must be carefully considered, lest the apostle should seem to have acted contrary to the Lord's precept, who often swore in this way, when he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not;\"[fn-4-P456_143686:155-nf] and again, \"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.\"[fn-4-P457_143818:156-nf] Of like nature also is that asseveration, \"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.\"[fn-4-P458_144026:157-nf] Unless, perchance, one were to say that it is to be reckoned swearing only when something is spoken of by which one swears; so that he has not used an oath, because he has not said, by God; but has said, \"God is witness.\" It is ridiculous to think so; yet because of the contentious, or those very slow of apprehension, lest any one should think there is a difference, let him know that the apostle has used an oath in this way also, saying, \"By your rejoicing, I die daily.\"[fn-4-P459_144520:158-nf] And let no one think that this is so expressed as if it were said, Your rejoicing makes me die daily; just as it is said, By his teaching he became learned, i.e. by his teaching it came about that he was perfectly instructed:the Greek copies decide the matter, where we find it written, Nh thn kauxhsin umeteran, an expression which is used only by one taking an oath. Thus, then, it is understood that the Lordgave the command not to swear in this sense, lest any one should eagerly seek after an oath as a good thing, and by the constant use of oaths sink down through force of habit into perjury. And therefore let him who understands that swearing is to be reckoned not among things that are good, but among things that are necessary, refrain as far as he can from indulgingin it, unless by necessity, when he sees men slow to believe what it is useful for them to believe,except they be assured by an oath. To this, accordingly, reference is made when it is said, \"Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay;\" this is good, and what is to be desired. \"For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil;\" i.e., if you are compelled to swear, know that it comes of a necessity arising from the infirmity of those whom you are trying to persuade of something; which infirmity is certainly an evil, from which we daily pray to be delivered, when we say, \"Deliver us from evil.\"[fn-4-P460_145916:159-nf] Hence He has not said, Whatsoever is more than these is evil; for you are not doing what is evil when you make a good use of an oath, which, although not in itself good, is yet necessary in order to persuade another that you are trying to move him for some useful end; but it \"cometh of evil\" on his part by whose infirmity you are compelled to swear.[fn-4-P461_146289:160-nf] But no one learns, unless he has had experience, how difficult it is both to get rid of a habit of swearing, and never to do rashly what necessity sometimes compels him to do.[fn-4-P462_146701:161-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"188","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"5.

Your third and last question relates to the passage in the same epistle where the apostle in discussing the resurrection, comes to the words: \"for he must reign, till he hath put all things under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all.\"[fn-23-P2305_578271:1643-nf] I am surprised that you have resolved to question me about this passage when that reverend man, Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, has occupied the eleventh book of his treatise against the Arians with a full examination and explanation of it. Yet I may at least say a few words. The chief stumbling-block in the passage is that the Son is said to be subject to the Father. Now which is the more shameful and humiliating, to be subject to the Father (often a mark of loving devotion as in the psalm \"truly my soul is subject unto God\"[fn-23-P2306_578827:1644-nf] ) or to be crucified and made the curse of the cross? For \"cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.\"[fn-23-P2307_578958:1645-nf] If Christ then for our sakes was made a curse that He might deliver us from the curse of the law, are you surprised that lie is also for our sakes subject to the Father to make us too subject to Him as He says in the gospel: \"No man cometh unto the Father but by me,\"[fn-23-P2308_579249:1646-nf] and \"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\"[fn-23-P2309_579341:1647-nf] Christ then is subject to the Father in the faithful; for all believers, nay the whole human race, are accounted members of His body. But in unbelievers, that is in Jews, heathens, and heretics, He is said to be not subject; for these members of His body are not subject to the faith. But in the end of the world when all His members shall see Christ, that is their own body, reigning, they also shall be made subject to Christ, that is to their own body, that the whole of Christ's body may be subject unto God and the Father, and that God may be all in all. He does not say \"that the Father may be all in all\" but that \"God\" may be, a title which properly belongs to the Trinity and may be referred not only to the Father but also to the Son and to the Holy Ghost. His meaning therefore is \"that humanity may be subject to the Godhead.\" By humanity we here intend not that gentleness and kindness which the Greeks call philanthropy but the whole human race. Moreover when he says \"that God may be all in all,\" it is to be taken in this sense. At present our Lord and Saviour is not all in all, but only a part in each of us. For instance He is wisdom in Solomon, generosity in David, patience in Job, knowledge of things to come in Daniel faith in Peter, zeal in Phinehas and Paul, virginity in John, and other virtues in others. But when the end of all things shall come, then shall He be all in all, for then the saints shall severally possess all the virtues and all will possess Christ in His entirety.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"707","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"I. \"A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things,\"[fn-24-P2420_620518:1731-nf] and \"every tree is known by his fruit.\"[fn-24-P2421_620582:1732-nf] You measure me by the scale of your own virtues and because of your own greatness magnify my littleness.

I know how unwilling you were to prove the affection of your people at such a cost, and that you would have preferred to win your countrymen's love while retaining your happiness. Such expressions of feeling, pleasant as they are when all goes well, are doubly welcome in time of sorrow. All Altinum, all Italy mourned Nepotian. The earth received his body; his soul was given back to Christ. You lost a nephew, the church a priest. He who should have followed you went before you.

For though we should live nine hundred years or more, as men did before the deluge, and though the days of Methuselah[fn-26-P2610_674482:1872-nf] should be granted us, yet that long space of time, when once it should have passed away and come to an end, would be as nothing. For to the man who has lived ten years and to him who has lived a thousand, when once the end of life comes and death's inexorable doom, all the past whether long or short is just the same; except that the older a man is, the heavier is the load of sin that he has to take with him.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"843","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

For, he argued, \"the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things,\"[fn-41-P4120_1108799:2971-nf] but the bodies that we shall have in heaven will be subtle and spiritual according to the words of the apostle: \"it is sown a natural body: it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-41-P4121_1108995:2972-nf] From all of which considerations he sought to prove that rational creatures have been for their faults and previous sins subjected to bodily conditions; and that according to the nature and guilt of their transgression they are born in this or that state of life. Some, he said, rejoice in sound bodies and wealthy and noble parents; others have for their portion diseased frames and poverty stricken homes; and by imprisonment in the present world and in bodies pay the penalty of their former sins. Paula listened and reported what she heard to me, at the same time pointing out the man. Thus upon me was laid the task of opposing this most noxious viper and deadly pest. It is of such that the Psalmist speaks when he writes: \"deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove unto the wild beast,\"[fn-41-P4122_1109816:2973-nf] and \"Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds;\"[fn-41-P4123_1109888:2974-nf] creatures who write iniquity and speak lies against the Lord and lift up their mouths against the Most High. As the fellow had tried to deceive Paula, I at her request went to him, and by asking him a few questions involved him in a dilemma. Do you believe, said I, that there will be a resurrection of the dead or do you disbelieve? He replied, I believe. I went on: Will the bodies that rise again be the same or different? He said, The same. Then I asked: What of their sex? Will that remain unaltered or will it be changed? At this question he became silent and swayed his head this way and that as a serpent does to avoid being struck. Accordingly I continued, As you have nothing to say I will answer for you and will draw the conclusion from your premises. If the woman shall not rise again as a woman nor the man as a man, there will be no resurrection of the dead. For the body is made up of sex and members. But if there shall be no sex and no members what will become of the resurrection of the body, which cannot exist without sex and members? And if there shall be no resurrection of the body, there can be no resurrection of the dead. But as to your objection taken from marriage, that, if the members shall remain the same, marriage must inevitably be allowed; it is disposed of by the Saviour's words: \"ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels.\"[fn-41-P4124_1111400:2975-nf] When it is said that they neither marry nor are given in marriage, the distinction of sex is shewn to persist. For no one says of things which have no capacity for marriage such as a stick or a stone that they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but this may well be said of those who while they can marry yet abstain from doing so by their own virtue and by the grace of Christ. But if you cavil at this and say, how shall we in that case be like the angels with whom there is neither male nor female, hear my answer in brief as follows. What the Lord promises to us is not the nature of angels but their mode of life and their bliss. And therefore John the Baptist is called an angel[fn-41-P4125_1112165:2976-nf] even before he is beheaded, and all God's holy men and virgins manifest in themselves even in this world the life of angels. When it is said \"ye shall be like the angels,\" likeness only is promised and not a change of nature.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":53,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1307","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"5. In his second book he maintains a plurality of worlds; not, however, as Epicurus taught, many like ones existing at once, but a new one beginning each time that the old comes to an end. There was a world before this world of ours, and after it there will be first one and then another and so on in regular succession. He is in doubt whether one world shall be so completely similar to another as to leave no room for any difference between them, or whether one world shall never wholly be indistinguishable from another. And again a little farther on he writes: \"if, as the course of the discussion makes necessary, all things can live without body, all bodily existence shall be swallowed up and that which once has been made out of nothing shall again be reduced to nothing. And yet a time will come when its use will be once more necessary.\" And in the same context: \"but if, as reason and the authority of scripture shew, this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality, death shall be swallowed up in victory and corruption in incorruption.[fn-47-P4724_1282407:3369-nf] And it may be that all bodily existence shall be removed, for it is only in this that death can operate.\" And a little farther on: \"if these things are not contrary to the faith, it may be that we shall some day live in a disembodied state. Moreover, if only he is fully subject to Christ who is disembodied, and if all must be made subject to Him, we too shall lose our bodies when we become fully subject to Him.\" And in the same passage: \"if all are to be made subject to God, all shall lay aside their bodies; and then all bodily existence shall be brought to nought. But if through the fall of reasonable beings it is a second time required it will reappear. For God has left souls to strive and struggle, to teach them that full and complete victory is to be attained not by their own efforts but by His grace. And so to my mind worlds vary with the sins which cause them, and those are exploded theories which maintain that all worlds are alike.\" And again: \"three conjectures occur to me with regard to the end; it is for the reader to determine which is nearest to the truth. For either we shall be bodiless when being made subject to Christ we shall be made subject to God and He shall be all in all; or as things made subject to Christ shall be with Christ Himself made subject to God and brought under one law, so all substance shall be refined into its most perfect form and rarified into aether which is a pure and uncompounded essence; or else the sphere which I have called motionless and all that it contains will be dissolved into nothing, and the sphere in which the antizone[fn-47-P4725_1284041:3370-nf] itself is contained shall be called `good ground,'[fn-47-P4726_1284124:3371-nf] and that other sphere which in its revolution surrounds the earth and goes by the name of heaven shall be reserved for the abode of the saints.\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1373","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"6.

That other interpretation also is not absurd, may, it is thoroughly accordant with both our faith and hope, that we are to take heaven and earth in the sense of spirit and flesh.

Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of sin is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-8-P842_326043:26-nf] Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,[fn-8-P843_326128:27-nf] yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: \"Put off the old man, and put on the new;\" which he goes on to explain by saying, \"Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.\"[fn-8-P844_326394:28-nf] But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaketh the truth from his heart may inhabit the holy hill of God?[fn-8-P845_326541:29-nf] But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the mystery of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the woman, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P846_326775:30-nf] with which mystery the apostle's words agree, where he says, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; set your thoughts[fn-8-P847_326988:31-nf] on things above.\"[fn-8-P848_327019:32-nf] For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the Father, means not to have thoughts[fn-8-P849_327135:33-nf] of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"15. In no wise therefore are souls cleansed and reconciled to God by sacrilegious imitations, or curious arts that are impious, or magical incantations; since the false mediator does not translate them to higher things, but rather blocks and cuts off the way thither through the affections, malignant in proportion as they are proud, which he inspires into those of his own company; which are not able to nourish the wings of virtues so as to fly upwards, but rather to heap up the weight of vices so as to press downwards; since the soul will fall down the more heavily, the more it seems to itself to have been carried upwards. Accordingly, as the Magi did when warned of God,[fn-9-P912_348147:68-nf] whom the star led to adore the low estate of the Lord; so we also ought to return to our country, not by the way by which we came, but by another way which the lowly King has taught, and which the proud king, the adversary of that lowly King, cannot block up. For to us, too, that we may adore the lowly Christ, the \"heavens have declared the glory of God, when their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.\"[fn-9-P913_348608:69-nf] A way was made for us to death through sin in Adam. For, \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.\"[fn-9-P914_348803:70-nf] Of this way the devil was the mediator, the persuader to sin, and the caster down into death. For he, too, applied his one death to work out our double death. Since he indeed died in the spirit through ungodliness, but certainly did not die in the flesh: yet both persuaded us to ungodliness, and thereby brought it to pass that we deserved to come into the death of the flesh. We desired therefore the one through wicked persuasion, the other followed us by a just condemnation; and therefore it is written, \"God made not death,\"[fn-9-P915_349358:71-nf] since He was not Himself the cause of death; but yet death was inflicted on the sinner, through His most just retribution. Just as the judge inflicts punishment on the guilty; yet it is not the justice of the judge, but the desert of the crime, which is the cause of the punishment.Whither, then, the mediator of death caused us to pass, yet did not come himself, that is, to the death of the flesh, there our Lord God introduced for us the medicine of correction, which He deserved not, by a hidden and exceeding mysterious decree of divine and profound justice. In order, therefore, that as by one man came death, so by one man might come also the resurrection of the dead;[fn-9-P916_350052:72-nf] because men strove more to shun that which they could not shun, viz. the death of the flesh, than the death of the spirit, i.e. punishment more than the desert of punishment (for not to sin is a thing about which either men are not solicitous or are too little solicitous; but not to die, although it be not within reach of attainment, is yet eagerly sought after); the Mediator of life, making it plain that death is not to be feared, which by the condition of humanity cannot now be escaped, but rather ungodliness, which can be guarded against through faith, meets us at the end to which we have come, but not by the way by which we came. For we, indeed, came to death through sin;He through righteousness: and, therefore, as our death is the punishment of sin, so His death was made a sacrifice for sin.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_08_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For if thou wouldest learn how great is the profit of the Scriptures, examine thyself, what thou becomest by hearing Psalms, and what by listening to a song of Satan; and how thou art disposed when staying in a Church, and how when sitting in a theatre; and thou wilt see that great is the difference between this soul and that, although both be one.

Augustin said: I recognize and embrace the testimonies of the divine Scriptures, and I will show in a few words, as God may deign to grant, how they are consistent with my faith. I say that there was free exercise of will in that man who was first formed. He was so made that absolutely nothing could resist his will, if he had willed to keep the precepts of God. But after he voluntarily sinned, we who have descended from his stock were plunged into necessity. But each one of us can by a little consideration find that what I say is true. For today in our actions before we are implicated by any habit, we have free choice of doing anything or not doing it. But when by that liberty we have done something and the pernicious sweetness and pleasure of that deed has taken hold upon the mind, by its own habit the mind is so implicated that afterwards it cannot conquer what by sinning it has fashioned for itself. We see many who do not wish to swear, but because the tongue has already become habituated, they are not able to prevent those things from going forth from the mouth which we cannot but ascribe to the root of evil. For that I may discuss with you those words, which as they do not withdraw from your mouth so may they be understood by your heart: you swear by the Paraclete. If therefore you wish to find out experimentally whether what I say is true, determine not to swear. You will see, that that habit is borne along as it has become accustomed to be. And this is what wars against the soul, habit formed in the flesh. This is indeed the mind of the flesh, which, as long as it cannot thus be subject to the law of God, so long is it the mind of the flesh; but when the soul has been illuminated it ceases to be the mind of the flesh. For thus it is said the mind of the flesh cannot be subject to the law of God, just as if it were said, that snow cannot be warm. Far so long as it is snow, it can in no way be warm. But as the snow is melted by heat, so that it may become warm, so the mind of the flesh, that is, habit formed with the flesh, when our mind has become illuminated, that is, when God has subjected for Himself the whole man to the choice of the divine law, instead of the evil habit of the soul, makes a good habit. Accordingly it is most truly said by the Lord of the two trees, the one good and the other evil, which you have called to mind, that they have their own fruits; that is, neither can the good tree yield evil fruit, nor the evil tree good fruit, but so long as it is evil. Let us take two men, a good and a bad. As long as he is good he cannot yield evil fruit; as long as he is bad he cannot yield good fruit. But that you may know that those two trees are so placed by the Lord, that free choice may be there signified, that these two trees are not natures but our wills, He Himself says in the gospel: \"Either make the tree good, or make the tree evil.\"[fn-9-P904_473740:9-nf] Who is it that can make nature? If therefore we are commanded to make a tree either good or evil, it is ours to choose what we will. Therefore concerning that sin of man and concerning that habit of soul formed with the flesh the apostle says: \"Let no one seduce you;\"[fn-9-P905_474028:10-nf] \"Every creature that has been made by God is good.\"[fn-9-P906_474096:11-nf] The same apostle whom you also have cited says: \"As through the disobedience of the one the many were constituted sinners; so also through the obedience of the one the many are constituted righteous.\"[fn-9-P907_474316:12-nf] \"Since through man is death, through man also is resurrection of the dead.\" As long therefore as we bear the image of the earthly man,[fn-9-P908_474468:13-nf] that is, as long as we live according to the flesh, which is also called the old man, we have the necessity of our habit, so that we may not do what we will. But when the grace of God has breathed the divine love into us and has made us subject to His will, to us it is said: \"Ye are called for freedom,\"[fn-9-P909_474798:14-nf] and \"the grace of God has made me free from the law of sin and of death.\"[fn-9-P910_474889:15-nf] But the law of sin is that whoever has sinned shall die. From this law we are freed when we have begun to be righteous. The law of death is that by which it was said to man: \"Earth thou art and into earth thou shalt go.\"[fn-9-P911_475129:16-nf] For from this very fact we are all so born, because we are earth, and from the fact that we are all so born because we are earth, we shall all go into earth on account of the desert of the sins of the first man. But on account of the grace of God, which frees us from the law of sin and of death, having been converted to righteousness we are freed; so that afterwards this same flesh tortures us with its punishment so long as we remain in sins, is subjected to us in resurrection, and shakes us by no adversity from keeping the law of God and His precepts.

For this [eternal life] is ready to be revealed at the last time,[fn-6-P633_424957:194-nf] that is, at the resurrection of the dead who are reserved not for that eternal death which is called \"the second death,\" but for the eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promises to His saints and faithful servants. Now none who shall partake of this life shall be made alive except in Christ, even as all die in Adam.[fn-6-P634_425299:195-nf] For as none whatever, of all those who belong to the generation according to the will of the flesh, die except in Adam, in whom all sinned; so, out of these, none at all who are regenerated by the will of the Spirit are endowed with life except in Christ, in whom all are justified. Because as through one all to condemnation, so through One all to justification.[fn-6-P635_425685:196-nf] Nor is there any middle place for any man, and so a man can only be with the devil who is not with Christ. Accordingly, also the Lord Himself (wishing to remove from the hearts of wrong-believers[fn-6-P636_425900:197-nf] that vague and indefinite middle condition, which some would provide for unbaptized infants,-as if, by reason of their innocence, they were embraced in eternal life, but were not, because of their unbaptized state, with Christ in His kingdom) uttered that definitive sentence of His, which shuts their mouths: \"He that is not with me is against me.\"[fn-6-P637_426274:198-nf] Take then the case of any infant you please: If he is already in Christ, why is he baptized? If, however, as the Truth has it, he is baptized just that he may be with Christ, it certainly follows that he who is not baptized is not with Christ; and because he is not \"with\" Christ, he is \"against\" Christ; for He has pronounced His own sentence, whichis so explicit that we ought not, and indeed cannot, impair it or change it. And how can he be \"against\" Christ, if not owing to sin? for it cannot possibly be from his soul or his body, both of these being the creation of God. Now if it be owing to sin, what sin can be found at such an age, except the ancient and original sin? Of course that sinful flesh in which all are born to condemnation is one thing, and that Flesh which was made \"after the likeness of sinful flesh,\" whereby also all are freed from condemnation, is another thing. It is, however, by no means meant to be implied that all who are born in sinful flesh are themselves actually cleansed by that Flesh which is \"like\" sinful flesh; \"for all men have not faith;\"[fn-6-P638_427381:199-nf] but that all who are born from the carnal union are born entirely of sinful flesh, whilst all who are born from the spiritual union are cleansed only by the Flesh which is in the likeness of sinful flesh. In other words, the former class are in Adam unto condemnation, the latter are in Christ unto justification. This is as if we should say, for example, that in such a city there is a certain midwife who delivers all; and in the same place there is an expert teacher who instructs all. By all, in the one case, only those who are born can possibly be understood; by all, in the other, only those who are taught: and it does not follow that all who are born also receive the instruction. But it is obvious to every one, that in the one case it is correctly said, \"she delivers all,\" since without her aid no one is born; and in the other, it is rightly said, \"he teaches all,\" since without his tutoring, no one learns.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"6. We acknowledge that the word of truth has in many places made use of these expressions; yet we absolutely deny that the freedom of the Spirit is in bondage to the pettiness of Paganism. On the contrary, we maintain that Scripture varies its expressions as occasion requires, according to the circumstances of the case. For instance, the phrase \"of which\" does not always and absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material,[fn-11-P1166_275824:20-nf] but it is more in accordance with the usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause, as in the words \"One God, of whom are all things,\"[fn-11-P1167_276074:21-nf] and again, \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1168_276783:22-nf] The word of truth has, however, frequently used this term in the case of the material, as when it says \"Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;\"[fn-11-P1169_276955:23-nf] and \"Thou shall make the candlestick of pure gold ;\"[fn-11-P1170_277028:24-nf] and \"The first man is of the earth, earthy;[fn-11-P1171_277426:25-nf] and \"Thou art formed out of clay as I am.\"[fn-11-P1172_277487:26-nf] But these men, to the end, as we have already remarked, that they may establish the difference of nature, have laid down the law that this phrase befits the Father alone. This distinction they have originally derived from heathen authorities, but here they have shewn no faithful accuracy of limitation. To the Son they have in conformity with the teaching of their masters given the title of instrument, and to the Spirit that of place, for they say in the Spirit, and through the Son. But when they apply \"of whom\" to God they no longer follow heathen example, but \"go over, as they say, to apostolic usage, as it is said, \"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,\"[fn-11-P1173_278169:27-nf] and \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1174_278219:28-nf] What, then, is the result of this systematic discussion?

For instance, what happened in Noah's time is prior to what happened to the men of Sodom, inasmuch as Noah is more remote from our own day; and, again, the events of the history of the men of Sodom are posterior, because they seem in a sense to approach nearer to our own day.

I testify to every man who is confessing Christ and denying God, that Christ will profit him nothing;[fn-14-P1440_352968:235-nf] to every man that calls upon God but rejects the Son, that his faith is vain;[fn-14-P1441_353070:236-nf] to every man that sets aside the Spirit, that his faith in the Father and the Son will be useless, for he cannot even hold it without the presence of the Spirit. For he who does not believe the Spirit does not believe in the Son, and he who has not believed in the Son does not believe in the Father. For none \"can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-14-P1442_353458:237-nf] and \"No man hath seen God at any time, but the only begotten God which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.\"[fn-14-P1443_353610:238-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":15,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"113","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"31. But even if some are baptized unto the Spirit, it is not, it is urged, on this account right for the Spirit to be ranked with God. Some \"were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.\"[fn-14-P1484_362053:265-nf] And it is admitted that faith even before now has been put in men; for \"The people believed God and his servant Moses.\"[fn-14-P1485_362201:266-nf] Why then, it is asked, do we, on account of faith and of baptism, exalt and magnify the Holy Spirit so far above creation, when there is evidence that the same things have before now been said of men? What, then, shall we reply? Our answer is that the faith in the Spirit is the same as the faith in the Father and the Son; and in like manner, too, the baptism. But the faith in Moses and in the cloud is, as it were, in a shadow and type. The nature of the divine is very frequently represented by the rough and shadowy outlines[fn-14-P1486_362751:267-nf] of the types;but because divine things are prefigured by small and human things, it is obvious that we must not therefore conclude the divine nature to be small. The type is an exhibition of things expected, and gives an imitative anticipation of the future. So Adam was a type of\"Him that was to come.\"[fn-14-P1487_363080:268-nf] Typically, \"That rock was Christ;\"[fn-14-P1488_363356:269-nf] and the water a type of the living power of the word; as He says, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\"[fn-14-P1489_363494:270-nf] The manna is a type of the living bread that came down from heaven;[fn-14-P1490_363583:271-nf] and the serpent on the standard,[fn-14-P1491_363637:272-nf] of the passion of salvation accomplished by means of the cross, wherefore they who even looked thereon were preserved. So in like manner, the history of the exodus of Israel is recorded to shew forth those who are being saved through baptism. For the firstborn of the Israelites were preserved, like the bodies of the baptized, by the giving of grace to them that were marked with blood. For the blood of the sheep is a type of the blood of Christ; and the firstborn, a type of the first-formed. And inasmuch as the first-formed of necessity exists in us, and, in sequence of succession, is transmitted till the end, it follows that \"in Adam\" we \"all die,\"[fn-14-P1492_364318:273-nf] and that \"death reigned\"[fn-14-P1493_364409:274-nf] until the fulfilling of the law and the coming of Christ. And the firstborn were preserved by God from being touched by the destroyer, to show that we who were made alive in Christ no longer die in Adam. The sea and the cloud for the time being led on through amazement to faith, but for the time to come they typically prefigured the grace to be. \"Who is wise and he shall understand these things?\"[fn-14-P1494_364831:275-nf] -how the sea is typically a baptism bringing about the departure of Pharaoh. in like manner as this washing causes the departure of the tyranny of the devil. The sea slew the enemy in itself: and in baptism too dies our enmity towards God. From the sea the people came out unharmed: we too, as it were, alive from the dead, step up from the water \"saved\" by the \"grace\" of Him who called us.[fn-14-P1495_365242:276-nf] And the cloud is a shadow of the gift of the Spirit, who cools the flame of our passions by the \"mortification\" of our\"members.\"[fn-14-P1496_365391:277-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":15,"verse":49,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"32. What then? Because they were typically baptized unto Moses, is the grace of baptism therefore small? Were it so, and if we were in each ease to prejudice the dignity of our privileges by comparing them with their types, not even one of these privileges could be reckoned great; then not the love of God, who gave His only begotten Son for our sins, would be great and extraordinary, because Abraham did not spare his own son;[fn-14-P1498_365840:278-nf] then even the passion of the Lord would not be glorious, because a sheep typified the offering instead of Isaac; then the descent into hell was not fearful, because Jonah had previously typified the death in three days and three nights. The same prejudicial comparison is made also in the case of baptism by all who judge of the reality by the shadow, and, comparing the typified with the type, attempt by means of Moses and the sea to disparage at once the whole dispensation of the Gospel.

Moreover by any one who carefully uses his reason it will be found that even at the moment of the expected appearance of the Lord from heaven the Holy Spirit will not, as some suppose, have no functions to discharge: on the contrary, even in the day of His revelation, in which the blessed and only potentate[fn-15-P1593_394396:359-nf] will judge the world in righteousness,[fn-15-P1594_394458:360-nf] the Holy Spirit will be present with Him. For who is so ignorant of the good things prepared by God for them that are worthy. as not to know that the crown of the righteous is the grace of the Spirit, bestowed in more abundant and perfect measure in that day, when spiritual glory shall be distributed to each in proportion as he shall have nobly played the man? For among the glories of the saints are \"many mansions\" in the Father's house,[fn-15-P1595_394927:361-nf] that is differences of dignities: for as \"star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1596_395068:362-nf] They, then, that were sealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,[fn-15-P1597_395161:363-nf] and preserve pure anti undiminished the first fruits which they received of the Spirit, are they that shall hear the words\"well done thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.\"[fn-15-P1598_395540:364-nf] In like manner they which have grieved the Holy Spirit by the wickedness of their ways, or have not wrought for Him that gave to them, shall be deprived of what they have received, their grace being transferred to others; or, according to one of the evangelists, they shall even be wholly cut asunder,[fn-15-P1599_395868:365-nf] -the cutting asunder meaning complete separation from the Spirit. The body is not divided, part being delivered to chastisement, and part let off; for when a whole has sinned it were like the old fables, and unworthy of a righteous judge, for only the half to suffer chastisement. Nor is the soul cut in two,-that soul the whole of which possesses the sinful affection throughout, and works the wickedness in co-operation with the body. The cutting asunder, as I have observed, is the separation for aye of the soul from the Spirit. For now, although the Spirit does not suffer admixture with the unworthy, He nevertheless does seem in a manner to be present with them that have once been sealed, awaiting the salvation which follows on their conversion; but then He will be wholly cut off from the soul that has defiled His grace. For this reason \"In Hell there is none that maketh confession; in death none that remembereth God,\"[fn-16-P1600_396824:366-nf] because the succour of the Spirit is no longer present. How then is it possible to conceive that the judgment is accomplished without the Holy Spirit, wherein the word points out that He is Himself the prize[fn-16-P1601_397054:367-nf] of the righteous, when instead of the earnest[fn-16-P1602_397124:368-nf] is given that which is perfect, and the first condemnation of sinners, when they are deprived of that which they seem to have? But the greatest proof of the conjunction of the Spirit with the Father and the Son is that He is said to have the same relation to God which the spirit in us has to each of us. \"For what man\" it is said, \"knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.\"[fn-16-P1603_397764:369-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":15,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"142","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"48. \"BE it so,\" it is rejoined, \"but glory is by no means so absolutely due to the Spirit as to require His exaltation by us in doxologies.\" Whence then could we get demonstrationsof the dignity of theour Spirit, \"passing all understanding,\"[fn-16-P1660_423399:407-nf] if His communion with the Father and the Son were not reckoned by our opponents as good for testimony of His rank?

For both being skilled in polite learning, the father as a grammarian, and the son as a rhetorician, they made themselves serviceable to the Christians at this crisis. For the former, as a grammarian, composed a grammar consistent with the Christian faith: he also translated the Books of Moses into heroic verse; and paraphrased all the historical books of the Old Testament, putting them partly into dactylic measure, and partly reducing them to the form of dramatic tragedy. He purposely employed all kinds of verse, that no form of expression peculiar to the Greek language might be unknown or unheard of amongst Christians. The younger Apollinaris, who was well trained in eloquence, expounded the gospels and apostolic doctrines in the way of dialogue, as Plato among the Greeks had done. Thus showing themselves useful to the Christian cause they overcame the subtlety of the emperor through their own labors. But Divine Providence was more potent than either their labors, or the craft of the emperor: for not long afterwards, in the manner we shall hereafter explain,[fn-11-P1136_499071:67-nf] the law became wholly inoperative; and the works of these men are now of no greater importance, than if they had never been written. But perhaps some one will vigorously reply saying: `On what grounds do you affirm that both these things were effected by the providence of God? That, the emperor's sudden death was very advantageous to Christianity is indeed evident: but surely the rejection of the Christian compositions of the two Apollinares, and the Christians beginning afresh to imbue their minds with the philosophy of the heathens, this works out no benefit to Christianity, for pagan philosophy teaches Polytheism, and is injurious to the promotion of true religion.' This objection I shall meet with such considerations as at present occur to me. Greek literature certainly was never recognized either by Christ or his Apostles as divinely inspired, nor on the other hand was it wholly rejected as pernicious. And this they did, I conceive, not inconsiderately. For there were many philosophers among the Greeks who were not far from the knowledge of God; and in fact these being disciplined by logical science, strenuously opposed the Epicureans and other contentious Sophists who denied Divine Providence, confuting their ignorance. And for these reasons they have become useful to all lovers of real piety: nevertheless they themselves were not acquainted with the Head of true religion, being ignorant of the mystery of Christ which `had been hidden from generations and ages.'[fn-11-P1137_500579:68-nf] And that this was so, the Apostle in his epistle to the Romans thus declares:[fn-11-P1138_500674:69-nf] `For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has shown it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, that they may be without excuse; because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.' From these words it appears that they had the knowledge of truth, which God had manifested to them; but were guilty on this account, that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God. Wherefore by not forbidding the study of the learned works of the Greeks, they left it to the discretion of those who wished to do so. This is our first argument in defense of the position we took: another may be thus put: The divinely inspired Scriptures undoubtedly inculcate doctrines that are both admirable in themselves, and heavenly in their character: they also eminently tend to produce piety and integrity of life in those who are guided by their precepts, pointing out a walk of faith which is highly approved of God. But they do not instruct us in the art of reasoning, by means of which we may be enabled successfully to resist those who oppose the truth. Besides adversaries are most easily foiled, when we can use · their own weapons against them. But this power was not supplied to Christians by the writings of the Apollinares. Julian had this in mind when he by law prohibited Christians from being educated in Greek literature, for he knew very well that the fables it contains would expose the whole pagan system, of which he had become the champion to ridicule and contempt. Even Socrates, the most celebrated of their philosophers, despised these absurdities, and was condemned on account of it, as if he had attempted to violate the sanctity of their deities. Moreover, both Christ and his Apostle enjoin us `to become discriminating money-changers,'[fn-11-P1139_502747:70-nf] so that we might `prove all things, and hold fast that which is good':[fn-11-P1140_502909:71-nf] directing us also to `beware lest any one should spoil us through philosophy and vain deceit.'[fn-11-P1141_503025:72-nf] But this we cannot do, unless we possess ourselves of the weapons of our adversaries: taking care that in making this acquisition we do not adopt their sentiments, but testing them, reject the evil, but retain all that is good and true: for good wherever it is found, is a property of truth. Should any one imagine that in making these assertions we wrest the Scriptures from their legitimate construction, let it be remembered that the Apostle not only does not forbid our being instructed in Greek learning, but that he himself seems by no means to have neglected it, inasmuch as he knows many of the sayings of the Greeks. Whence did he get the saying, `The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow-bellies,'[fn-11-P1142_503758:73-nf] but from a perusal of The Oracles of Epimenides,[fn-11-P1143_503824:74-nf] the Cretan Initiator? Or how would he have known this, `For we are also his offspring,'[fn-11-P1144_504341:75-nf] had he not been acquainted with The Phenomena of Aratus[fn-11-P1145_504417:76-nf] the astronomer?

It is well known that in ancient times the doctors of the church by unhindered usage were accustomed to exercise themselves in the learning of the Greeks, until they had reached an advanced age: this they did with a view to improve themselves in eloquence and to strengthen and polish their mind, and at the same time to enable them to refute the errors of the heathen.

Is this the righteousness we speak of, never to see Christ, and yet to believe on Him; seeing that the faith whereby the just liveth is commended on the very ground of believing that the Christ whom it seeth not meanwhile, it shall see some day? Once more, in reference to this righteousness, are we to say that the Apostle Paul was not righteous when confessing that He had seen Christ after His ascension into heaven,[fn-31-P3173_1775370:14-nf] which was undoubtedly the time of which He had already said, \"Ye shall see me no more\"?

In baptized infants, it is deprived of guilt, is left for the struggle [of life],[fn-7-P744_468674:7-nf] but pursues with no condemnation, such as die before the struggle. Unbaptized infants it implicates as guilty and as children of wrath, even if they die in infancy, draws into condemnation. In baptized adults, however, endowed with reason, whatever consent their mind gives to this concupiscence for the commission of sin is an act of their own will. After all sins have been blotted out, and that guilt has been cancelled which by nature[fn-7-P745_469153:8-nf] bound men in a conquered condition, it still remains,-but not to hurt in any way those who yield noconsent to it for unlawful deeds,-until deathis swallowed up in victory[fn-7-P746_469366:9-nf] and, in that perfection of peace, nothing is left to be conquered. Such, however, as yield consent to it for the commission of unlawful deeds, it holds as guilty; and unless, through the medicine of repentance, and through works of mercy, by the intercession in our behalf of the heavenly High Priest, they be healed, it conducts us to the second death and utter condemnation. It was on this account that the Lord, when teaching us to pray, advised us, besides other petitions, to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into tempation, but deliver us from evil.\"[fn-7-P747_469980:10-nf] For evil remains in our flesh, not by reason of the nature in which man was created by God and wisdom, but by reason of that offence into which he fell by his own will, and in which, since its powers are lost, he is not healed with the same facility of will as that with which he was wounded. Of this evil the apostle says: \"I know that in my flesh dwelleth no good thing ;\"[fn-7-P748_470378:11-nf] and it is likewise to the same evil that he counsels us to give no obedience, when he says: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to obey the lusts thereof.\"[fn-7-P749_470567:12-nf] When, therefore, we have by an unlawful inclination of our will yielded consent to these lusts of the flesh, we say, with a view to the cure of this fault, \"Forgive us our debts;\"[fn-7-P750_470765:13-nf] and we at the same time apply the remedy of a work of mercy, in that we add, \"As we forgive our debtors.\" That we may not, however, yield such consent, let us pray for assistance, and say, \"And lead us not into temptation;\"-not that God ever Himself tempts any one with such temptation, \"for God is not a tempter to evil, neither tempteth He any man;\"[fn-7-P751_471136:14-nf] but in order that whenever we feel the rising of temptation from our concupiscence, we may not be deserted by His help, in order that thereby we may be able to conquer, and not be carried away by enticement. We then add our request for that which is to be perfected at the last, when mortality shall be swallowed up of life:[fn-7-P752_471478:15-nf] \"But deliver us from evil.\"[fn-7-P753_471524:16-nf] For then there will exist no longer a concupiscence which we are bidden to struggle against, and not to consent to.

Our reply is briefly this,-the words knew and till in the language of Holy Scripture are capable of a double meaning. As to the former, he himself gave us a dissertation to show that it must be referred to sexual intercourse, and no one doubts that it is often used of the knowledge of the understanding, as, for instance, \"the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew it not.\" Now we have to prove that just as in the one case he has followed the usage of Scripture, so with regard to the word till he is utterly refuted by the authority of the same Scripture, which often denotes by its use a fixed time (he himself told us so), frequently time without limitation, as when God by the mouth of the prophet says to certain persons,[fn-60-P6021_1785451:15-nf] \"Even to old age I am he.\" Will He cease to be God when they have grown old? And the Saviour in the Gospel tells the Apostles,[fn-60-P6022_1785596:16-nf] \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Will the Lord then after the end of the world has come forsake His disciples, and at the very time when seated on twelve thrones they are to judge the twelve tribes of Israel will they be bereft of the company of their Lord? Again Paul the Apostle writing to the Corinthians[fn-60-P6023_1785956:17-nf] says, \"Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's, at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.\" Granted that the passage relates to our Lord's human nature, we do not deny that the words are spoken of Him who endured the cross and is commanded to sit afterwards on the right hand. What does he mean then by saying, \"for he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet\"? Is the Lord to reign only until His enemies begin to be under His feet, and once they are under His feet will He cease to reign? Of course His reign will then commence in its fulness when His enemies begin to be under His feet. David also in the fourth Song of Ascents[fn-60-P6024_1786836:18-nf] speaks thus, \"Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.\" Will the prophet, then, look unto the Lord until he obtain mercy, and when mercy is obtained will he turn his eyes down to the ground? although elsewhere he says,[fn-60-P6025_1787338:19-nf] \"Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.\" I could accumulate countless instances of this usage, and cover the verbosity of our assailant with a cloud of proofs; I shall, however, add only a few, and leave the reader to discover like ones for himself.","title":"The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_13_book_iii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"What the apostle says.: \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it passed upon all men, in which all have sinned;\"[fn-12-P1214_628605:41-nf] we must, however, for the present so accept as not to seem rashly and foolishly to oppose the many great passages of Holy Scripture, which teach us that no man can obtain eternal life without that union with Christ which is effected in Him and with Him, when we are imbued with His sacraments and incorporated with the members of His body. Now this statement which the apostle addresses to the Romans, \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it passed upon all men, in which all have sinned,\" tallies in sense with his words to the Corinthians: \"Since by man came death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead.

The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.\" He was treating of the resurrection of the body, wherein death shall be swallowed up in victory, when this mortal shall have put on immortality.

Think it not therefore unworthy of Him to have called them by a star; since by the same rule thou wilt find fault with all the Jewish rites also, the sacrifices, and the purifications, and the new moons, and the ark, and the temple too itself, For even these derived their origin from Gentile grossness.[fn-6-P647_198513:4-nf] Yet for all that, God, for the salvation of them that were in error, endured to be served by these things, whereby those without were used to serve devils; only He slightly altered them; that He might draw them off by degrees from their customs, and lead them towards the highest wisdom. Just so He did in the case of the wise men also, not disdaining to call them by sight of a star, that He might lift them higher ever after. Therefore after He hath brought them, leading them by the hand, and hath set them by the manger; it is no longer by a star, but by an angel that He now discourses unto them. Thus did they by little and little become better men.

And accordingly, those whom God \"from the beginning\" conjoined, \"two into one flesh,\" man shall not at the present day separate.[fn-11-P1116_288893:26-nf] The apostle, too, writing to the Ephesians, says that God \"had proposed in Himself, at the dispensation of the fulfilment of the times, to recall to the head\" (that is, to the beginning) \"things universal in Christ, which are above the heavens and above the earth in Him.\"[fn-11-P1117_289189:27-nf] So, too, the two letters of Greece, the first and the last, the Lord assumes to Himself, as figures of the beginning and end! which concur in Himself: so that, just as Alpha rolls on till it reaches Omega, and again Omega rolls back till it reaches Alpha, in the same way He might show that in Himself is both the downward course of the beginning on to the end, and the backward course of the end up to the beginning; so that every economy, ending in Him through whom it began,-through the Word of God, that is, who was made flesh,[fn-11-P1118_289830:28-nf] -may have an end correspondent to its beginning. And so truly in Christ are all things recalled to \"the beginning,\" that even faith returns from circumcision to the integrity of that (original) flesh, as \"it was from the beginning; and freedom of meats and abstinence from blood alone, as \"it was from the beginning; \"and the individuality of marriage, as \"it was from the beginning; \"and the restriction of divorce, which was not \"from the beginning; \"and lastly, the whole man into Paradise, where he was \"from the beginning.\" Why, then, ought He not to restore Adam thither at least as a monogamist, who cannot present him in so entire perfection as he was when dismissed thence?

But, presenting to your weakness the gift of the example of His own flesh, the more perfect Adam-that is, Christ, more perfect on this account as well (as on others), that He was more entirely pure-stands before you, if you are willing (to copy Him), as a voluntary celibate in the flesh. If, however, you are unequal (to that perfection), He stands before you a monogamist in spirit, having one Church as His spouse, according to the figure of Adam and of Eve, which (figure) the apostle interprets of that great sacrament of Christ and the Church, (teaching that), through the spiritual, it was analogous to the carnal monogamy. You see, therefore, after what manner, renewing your origin even in Christ, you cannot trace down that (origin) without the profession of monogamy; unless, (that is), you be in flesh what He is in spirit; albeit withal, what He was in flesh, you equally ought to have been.","title":"VI.

And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, (for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth,) it was said unto her, \"The eider shall serve the younger.\"[fn-15-P1556_728682:177-nf] This is the house of Israel, or rather the house of Judah, on account of Christ, who came of the tribe of Judah. This is the house of the children of promise, -not by reason of their own merits, but of the kindness of God. For God promises what He Himself performs: He does not Himself promise, and another perform; which would no longer be promising, but prophesying. Hence it is \"not of works, but of Him that calleth,\"[fn-15-P1557_729126:178-nf] lest the result should be their own, not God's; lest the reward should be ascribed not to His grace, but to their due; and so grace should be no longer grace which was so earnestly defended and maintained by him who, though the least of the apostles, laboured more abundantly than all the rest,-yet not himself, but the grace of God that was with him.[fn-15-P1558_729498:179-nf] \"They shall all know me,\"[fn-15-P1559_729549:180-nf] He says,-\"All,\" the house of Israel and house of Judah. \"All,\" however, \"are not Israel which are of Israel,\"[fn-15-P1560_729681:181-nf] but they only to whom it is said in \"the psalm concerning the morning aid\"[fn-15-P1561_729775:182-nf] (that is, concerning the new refreshing light, meaning that of the new testament), \"All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him; and fear Him, all ye the seed of Israel.\"[fn-15-P1562_730006:183-nf] All the seed, without exception, even the entire seed of the promise and of the called, but only of those who are the called according to His purpose.[fn-15-P1563_730178:184-nf] \"For whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.\"[fn-15-P1564_730344:185-nf] \"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law,\"-that is, which comes from the Old Testament into the New,-\"but to that also which is of faith,\" which was indeed prior to the law, even \"the faith of Abraham,\"-meaning those who imitate the faith of Abraham,-\" who is the father of us all; as it is written, I have made thee the father of many nations.\"[fn-15-P1565_730817:186-nf] Now all these predestinated, called, justified, glorified ones, shall know God by the grace of the new testament, from the least to the greatest of them.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":50,"source_paragraph":"167","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"According to some, however, they who do by nature the things contained in the law must not be regarded as yet in the number of those whom Christ's grace justifies, but rather as among those some of whose actions (although they are those of ungodly men, who do not truly and rightly worship the true God) we not only cannot blame, but even justly and rightly praise, since they have been done-so far as we read, or know, or hear-according to the rule of righteousness; though at the same time, were we to discuss the question with what motive they are done, they would hardly be found to be such as [deserve the praise and defence which are due torighteous conduct. [XXVIII.] Still, since God's image has not been so completely erased in the soul of man by the stain of earthly affections, as to have left remaining there not even the merest lineaments of it whence it might be justly said that man, even in the ungodliness of his life, does, or appreciates, some things contained in the law; if this is what is meant by the statement that \"the Gentiles, which have not the law\" (that is, the law of God), \"do by nature the things contained in the law,\"[fn-16-P1646_750463:243-nf] and that men of this character\" are a law to themselves,\" and \"show the work of the law written in their hearts,\"-that is to say, what was impressed on their hearts when they were created in the image of God has not been wholly blotted out:-even in this view of the subject, that wide difference will not be disturbed, which separates the new covenant from the old, and which lies in the fact that by the new covenant the law of God is written in the hearts of believers, whereas in the old it was inscribed on tables of stone. For this writing in the heart is effected by renovation, although it had not been completely blotted out by the old nature. For just as that image of God is renewed in the mind of believers by the new testament, which impiety had not quite abolished (for there had remained undoubtedly that which the soul of man cannot be except it be rational), so also the law of God, which had not been wholly blotted out there by unrighteousness, is certainly written thereon, renewed by grace. Now in the Jews the law which was written on tables could not effect this new inscription, which is justification, but only transgression. For they too were men, and there was inherent in them that power of nature, which enables the rational soul both to perceive and do what is lawful; but the godliness which transfers to another life happy and immortal has \"a spotless law, converting souls,\"[fn-16-P1647_751890:244-nf] so that by the light thereof they may be renewed, and that be accomplished in them which is written, \"There has been manifested over us, O Lord, the light of Thy countenance.\"[fn-16-P1648_752085:245-nf] Turned away from which, they have deserved to grow old, whilst they are incapable of renovation except by the grace of Christ,-in other words, without the intercession of the Mediator; there being \"one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all.\"[fn-16-P1649_752406:246-nf] Should those be strangers to His grace of whom we are treating, and who (after the manner of which we have spoken with sufficient fulness already) \"do by nature the things contained in the law,\"[fn-16-P1650_752625:247-nf] of what use will be their \"excusing thoughts\" to them \"in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men,\"[fn-16-P1651_752753:248-nf] unless it be perhaps to procure for them a milder punishment? For as, on the one hand, there are certain venial sins which do not hinder the righteous man from the attainment of eternal life, and which are unavoidable in this life, so, on the other hand, there are some good works which are of no avail to an ungodly man towards the attainment of everlasting life, although it would be very difficult to find the life of any very bad man whatever entirely without them. But inasmuch as in the kingdom of God the saints differ in glory as one star does from another,[fn-16-P1652_753343:249-nf] so likewise, in the condemnation of everlasting punishment, it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that other city;[fn-16-P1653_753487:250-nf] whilst some men will be twofold more the children of hell than others.[fn-16-P1654_753577:251-nf] Thus in the judgment of God not even this fact will be without its influence,-that one man will have sinned more, or less, than another, even when both are involved in the ungodliness that is worthy of damnation.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":56,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"183","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But there is yet another distinction to be observed,-since they who are under the law both attempt to work their own righteousness through fear of punishment, and fail to do God's righteousness, because this is accomplished by the love to which only what is lawful is pleasing, and never by the fear which is forced to have in its work the thing which is lawful, although it has something else in its will which would prefer, if it were only possible, that to be lawful which is not lawful. These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after?

For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him.

Of course they are not at all able to discover such a man, if they receive in a becoming manner the testimony of the divine writings. Still, for all that, it must not by any means be said that the possibility is lacking to God whereby the will of man can be so assisted, that there can be accomplished in every respect even now in a man, not that righteousness only which is of faith,[fn-18-P1859_807913:402-nf] but that also in accordance with which we shall by and by have to live for ever in the very vision of God.

I know that thou art now admiring the grace of Hermione, and thou judgest that there is nothing in the world to be compared to her comeliness; but if you choose, O friend, you shall yourself exceed her in comeliness and gracefulness, as much as golden statues surpass those which are made of clay. For if beauty, when occurs in the body, so fascinates and excites the minds of most men, when the soul is refulgent with it what can match beauty and grace of this kind? For the groundwork of this corporeal beauty is nothing else but phlegm, and blood, and humor, and bile, and the fluid of masticated food. For by these things both eyes and cheeks, and all the other features, are supplied with moisture; and if they do not receive that moisture, daily skin becoming unduly withered, and the eyes sunken, the whole grace of the countenance forthwith vanishes; so that if you consider what is stored up inside those beautiful eyes, and that straight nose, and the mouth and the cheeks, you will affirm the well-shaped body to be nothing else than a whited sepulchre; the parts within are full of so much uncleanness. Morever when you see a rag with any of these things on it, such as phlegm, or spittle you cannot bear to touch it with even the tips of your fingers, nay you cannot even endure looking at it; and yet are you in a flutter of excitement about the storehouses and depositories of these things? But thy beauty was not of this kind, but excelled it as heaven is superior to earth; or rather it was much better and more brilliant than this For no one has anywhere seen a soul by itself, stripped of the body; but yet even so I will endeavour to present to you the beauty of this soul from another source. I mean from the case of the greater powers Hear at least how the beauty of these struck the man greatly beloved; for wishing to set forth their beauty and being unable to find a body of the same character, he had recourse to metallic substances, and he was not satisfied even with these, but took the brilliancy of lightning for his illustration.[fn-6-P677_397209:57-nf] Now if those powers, even when they did not disclose their essential nature pure and bare, but only in a very dim and shadowy way, nevertheless shone so brightly, what must naturally be their appearance, when set free froth every veil? Now we ought to form some such image of the beauty of the soul. \"For they shall be,\" we read \"equal unto the angels.\"[fn-6-P678_397582:58-nf] Now in the case of bodies the fighter and finer kinds, and those which have retreated to the path which tend towards the incorporeal, are very much better and more wonderful than the others. The sky at least is more beautiful than the earth, and fire than water, and the stars than precious stones; and we admire the rainbow far more than violets and roses, and all other flowers which are upon the earth. And in short if it were possible with the bodily eyes to behold the beauty of the soul you would laugh to scorn these corporeal illustrations, so feebly have they presented to us the gracefulness of the soul. Let us not then neglect such a possession, nor such great happiness, and especially when the approach to that kind of beauty becomes easy to us by our hopes of the things to come. \"For our light affliction?\" we read, \"which is but for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\"[fn-6-P679_398709:59-nf] Now if the blessed Paul called such afflictions as thou wottest of light and easy, because he did not look at the things which are seen, much more tolerable is it merely to cease from wantonness. For we are not calling thee to those dangers which he underwent, nor to those deaths which he incurred daily,[fn-6-P680_399037:60-nf] the constant beatings and scourgings, the bonds, the enmity of the whole world, the hatred of his own people, the frequent vigils, the long journies, the shipwrecks, the attacks of robbers, the plots of his own kinsfolk, the distresses on account of his friends, the hunger, the cold, the nakedness, the burning, the despondency on account both of those who belonged to him, and those who did not belong to him. None of these things do we now demand of thee; all that we ask for is that you would release yourself from your accursed bondage, and return to your former freedom, having considered both the punishment arising from your wantonness, and the honor belonging to your former manner of life. For that unbelievers should be but languidly affected by the thought of the resurrection and never be in fear of this kind, is nothing wonderful; but that we who are more firmly persuaded concerning the things of the other world than those of the present, should spend our life in this miserable and deplorable way and be nowise affected by the memory of those things, but sink into a state of extreme insensibility-this is irrational in the highest degree. For when we who believe do the deeds of unbelievers, or rather are in a more miserable plight than they (for there are some among them who have been eminent for the virtue of their life), what consolation, what excuse will be left for us? And many merchants indeed who have incurred shipwreck have not given way, but have pursued the same journey, and this when the loss which has befallen them was not owing to their own carelessness, but to the force of the winds; and shall we who have reason to be confident concerning the end, and know certainly that if we do not wish it, neither shipwreck nor accident of any kind will bring us damage, not lay hold of the work again, and carry on our business as we did aforetime, but lie in idleness and keep our hands to ourselves? And would that we kept them merely to ourselves and did not use them against ourselves which is a token of stark madness. For if any pugilist, leaving his antagonist were to turn his hands against his own head, and deal blows to his own face, should we not, I ask, rank him among madmen? For the devil has upset us and cast us down; therefore we ought to get up, and not to be dragged down again and precipitate ourselves, and add blows dealt by ourselves to the blows dealt by him. For the blessed David also had a fall like that which has now happened to you; and not this only but another also which followed it. I mean that of murder. What then? did he remain prostrate? Did he not immediately rise up again with energy and place himself in portion to fight the enemy? In fact he wrestled with him so bravely, that even after his death he was the protector of his offspring. For when Solomon had perpetrated great inquity, and had deserved countless deaths, God said that He would leave him the kingdom intact, thus speaking \"I will surely rend the kingdom out of thine hand and will give it to thy servant. Nevertheless I will not do this in thy days.\" Wherefore? \"For David thy father's sake, I will take it out of the hand of thy son.\"[fn-6-P681_402256:61-nf] And again when Hezekiah was about to run the greatest possible risk, although he was a righteous man, God said that He would succour him for the sake of this saint. \"For I will cast my shield\" He saith, \"over this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant: David's sake.\"[fn-6-P682_402560:62-nf] So great is the force of repentance. But if he had determined with himself, as you do now, that henceforth it was impossible to propitiate God, and if he had said within himself: \"God has honoured me with great honour, and has given me a place among among the prophets, and has entrusted me with the government of my countrymen, and rescued me out of countless perils, how then, whenhave offended against Him after such great benefits, and have perpetrated the worst crimes, shall I be able to recover his favour?\" If he had thought thus, not only would he not have done the things which he afterwards his former evils.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":15,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_13_letter_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"14. I know that thou art now admiring the grace of Hermione, and thou judgest that there is nothing in the world to be compared to her comeliness; but if you choose, O friend, you shall yourself exceed her in comeliness and gracefulness, as much as golden statues surpass those which are made of clay. For if beauty, when occurs in the body, so fascinates and excites the minds of most men, when the soul is refulgent with it what can match beauty and grace of this kind? For the groundwork of this corporeal beauty is nothing else but phlegm, and blood, and humor, and bile, and the fluid of masticated food. For by these things both eyes and cheeks, and all the other features, are supplied with moisture; and if they do not receive that moisture, daily skin becoming unduly withered, and the eyes sunken, the whole grace of the countenance forthwith vanishes; so that if you consider what is stored up inside those beautiful eyes, and that straight nose, and the mouth and the cheeks, you will affirm the well-shaped body to be nothing else than a whited sepulchre; the parts within are full of so much uncleanness. Morever when you see a rag with any of these things on it, such as phlegm, or spittle you cannot bear to touch it with even the tips of your fingers, nay you cannot even endure looking at it; and yet are you in a flutter of excitement about the storehouses and depositories of these things? But thy beauty was not of this kind, but excelled it as heaven is superior to earth; or rather it was much better and more brilliant than this For no one has anywhere seen a soul by itself, stripped of the body; but yet even so I will endeavour to present to you the beauty of this soul from another source. I mean from the case of the greater powers Hear at least how the beauty of these struck the man greatly beloved; for wishing to set forth their beauty and being unable to find a body of the same character, he had recourse to metallic substances, and he was not satisfied even with these, but took the brilliancy of lightning for his illustration.[fn-6-P677_397209:57-nf] Now if those powers, even when they did not disclose their essential nature pure and bare, but only in a very dim and shadowy way, nevertheless shone so brightly, what must naturally be their appearance, when set free froth every veil? Now we ought to form some such image of the beauty of the soul. \"For they shall be,\" we read \"equal unto the angels.\"[fn-6-P678_397582:58-nf] Now in the case of bodies the fighter and finer kinds, and those which have retreated to the path which tend towards the incorporeal, are very much better and more wonderful than the others. The sky at least is more beautiful than the earth, and fire than water, and the stars than precious stones; and we admire the rainbow far more than violets and roses, and all other flowers which are upon the earth. And in short if it were possible with the bodily eyes to behold the beauty of the soul you would laugh to scorn these corporeal illustrations, so feebly have they presented to us the gracefulness of the soul. Let us not then neglect such a possession, nor such great happiness, and especially when the approach to that kind of beauty becomes easy to us by our hopes of the things to come. \"For our light affliction?\" we read, \"which is but for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\"[fn-6-P679_398709:59-nf] Now if the blessed Paul called such afflictions as thou wottest of light and easy, because he did not look at the things which are seen, much more tolerable is it merely to cease from wantonness. For we are not calling thee to those dangers which he underwent, nor to those deaths which he incurred daily,[fn-6-P680_399037:60-nf] the constant beatings and scourgings, the bonds, the enmity of the whole world, the hatred of his own people, the frequent vigils, the long journies, the shipwrecks, the attacks of robbers, the plots of his own kinsfolk, the distresses on account of his friends, the hunger, the cold, the nakedness, the burning, the despondency on account both of those who belonged to him, and those who did not belong to him. None of these things do we now demand of thee; all that we ask for is that you would release yourself from your accursed bondage, and return to your former freedom, having considered both the punishment arising from your wantonness, and the honor belonging to your former manner of life. For that unbelievers should be but languidly affected by the thought of the resurrection and never be in fear of this kind, is nothing wonderful; but that we who are more firmly persuaded concerning the things of the other world than those of the present, should spend our life in this miserable and deplorable way and be nowise affected by the memory of those things, but sink into a state of extreme insensibility-this is irrational in the highest degree. For when we who believe do the deeds of unbelievers, or rather are in a more miserable plight than they (for there are some among them who have been eminent for the virtue of their life), what consolation, what excuse will be left for us? And many merchants indeed who have incurred shipwreck have not given way, but have pursued the same journey, and this when the loss which has befallen them was not owing to their own carelessness, but to the force of the winds; and shall we who have reason to be confident concerning the end, and know certainly that if we do not wish it, neither shipwreck nor accident of any kind will bring us damage, not lay hold of the work again, and carry on our business as we did aforetime, but lie in idleness and keep our hands to ourselves? And would that we kept them merely to ourselves and did not use them against ourselves which is a token of stark madness. For if any pugilist, leaving his antagonist were to turn his hands against his own head, and deal blows to his own face, should we not, I ask, rank him among madmen? For the devil has upset us and cast us down; therefore we ought to get up, and not to be dragged down again and precipitate ourselves, and add blows dealt by ourselves to the blows dealt by him. For the blessed David also had a fall like that which has now happened to you; and not this only but another also which followed it. I mean that of murder. What then? did he remain prostrate? Did he not immediately rise up again with energy and place himself in portion to fight the enemy?

Truth springs, forsooth, from your fiction. You praise this First Man for using changeable and delusive forms in the contest. If you, then, speak the truth, you do not imitate him. If you imitate him, you deceive as he did. But our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the true and truthful Son of God, the true and truthful Son of man, both of which He testifies of Himself, derived the eternity of His godhead from true God, and His incarnation from true man. Your First Man is not the first man of the apostle. \"The first man,\" he says, \"was of the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven, heavenly.

Let burning lust be absent, and he will not say it is better to marry. The word better always implies a comparison with something worse, not a thing absolutely good and incapable of comparison.

But why do we argue, and why are we eager to frame a clever and victorious reply to our opponent?[fn-64-P6431_1986755:262-nf] \"Old things have passed away, behold all things have become new.\" I will run through the utterances of the Apostles, and as to the instances afforded by Solomon I added short expositions to facilitate their being understood, so now I will go over the passages bearing on Christian purity and continence, and will make of many proofs a connected series. By this method I shall succeed in omitting nothing relating to chastity, and shall avoid being tediously long. Amongst other passages, Paul the Apostle writes to the Romans:[fn-64-P6432_1987303:263-nf] \"What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.\" I suppose too that the end of marriage is death. But the compensating fruit of sanctification, fruit belonging either to virginity or to continence, is eternal life. And afterwards:[fn-64-P6433_1987764:264-nf] \"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.\" \"When,\" he says, \"we were in the flesh, and not in the newness of the Spirit but in the oldness of the letter,\" we did those things which pertained to the flesh, and bore fruit unto death. But now because we are dead to the law, through the body of Christ, let us bear fruit to God, that we may belong to Him who rose from the dead. And elsewhere, having previously said,[fn-64-P6434_1988671:265-nf] \"I know that the law is spiritual,\" and having discussed at some length the violence of the flesh which frequently drives us to do what we would not, he at last continues: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" And again, \"So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And,[fn-64-P6435_1989121:266-nf] \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and death.\" And more clearly in what follows he teaches that Christians do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit:[fn-64-P6436_1989479:267-nf] \"For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,\" and so on to where he says,[fn-64-P6437_1990011:268-nf] \"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.\" If the[fn-64-P6438_1990318:269-nf] wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God, and they who are in the flesh cannot please God, I think that they who perform the functions of marriage love the wisdom of the flesh, and therefore are in the flesh. The Apostle being desirous to withdraw us from the flesh and to join us to the Spirit, says afterwards:[fn-64-P6439_1990653:270-nf] \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think according to chastity\"[fn-64-P6440_1991185:271-nf] (not soberly as the Latin versions badly render), but \"think,\" he says, \"according to chastity,\" for the Greek words are e0ij to swfronein. Let us consider what the Apostle says: \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.\" What he says is something like this-God indeed permits marriage, He permits second marriages, and if necessary, prefers even third marriages to fornication and adultery. But we who ought to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our reasonable service, should consider, not what God permits, but what He wishes: that we may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. It follows that what He merely permits is neither good, nor acceptable, nor perfect. And he gives his reasons for this advice:[fn-64-P6441_1992056:272-nf] \"Knowing the season, that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed. The night is far spent, and the day is at hand.\" And lastly: \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.\" God's will is one thing, His indulgence another. Whence, writing to the Corinthians, he says,[fn-64-P6442_1992505:273-nf] \"I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.\" He who[fn-64-P6443_1992812:274-nf] is in the merely animal state, and does not receive the things pertaining to the Spirit of God (for he is foolish, and cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned), he is not fed with the food of perfect chastity, but with the coarse milk of marriage. As through man came death, so also through man came the resurrection of the dead. As in Adam we all die, so in Christ we shall all be made alive. Under the law we served the old Adam, under the Gospel let us serve the new Adam. For the first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.[fn-64-P6444_1993681:275-nf] \"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" This is so clear that no explanation can make it clearer: \"Flesh and blood,\" he says, \"cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" If corruption attaches to all intercourse, and incorruption is characteristic of chastity, the rewards of chastity cannot belong to marriage.[fn-64-P6445_1994423:276-nf] \"For we know that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven. We are willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether in the body, or out of the body, to be well-pleasing unto God.\" And by way of more fully explaining what he did not wish them to be he says elsewhere:[fn-64-P6446_1994969:277-nf] \"I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.\" But if you choose to apply the words to the whole Assembly of believers, and in this betrothal to Christ include both married women, and the twice-married, and widows, and virgins, that also makes for us. For whilst he invites all to chastity and to the reward of virginity, he shows that virginity is more excellent than all these conditions. And again writing to the Galatians he says:[fn-64-P6447_1995465:278-nf] \"Because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\" Among the works of the law is marriage, and accordingly under it they are cursed who have no children.

By this method I shall succeed in omitting nothing relating to chastity, and shall avoid being tediously long. Amongst other passages, Paul the Apostle writes to the Romans:[fn-64-P6432_1987303:263-nf] \"What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.\" I suppose too that the end of marriage is death. But the compensating fruit of sanctification, fruit belonging either to virginity or to continence, is eternal life. And afterwards:[fn-64-P6433_1987764:264-nf] \"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.\" \"When,\" he says, \"we were in the flesh, and not in the newness of the Spirit but in the oldness of the letter,\" we did those things which pertained to the flesh, and bore fruit unto death. But now because we are dead to the law, through the body of Christ, let us bear fruit to God, that we may belong to Him who rose from the dead. And elsewhere, having previously said,[fn-64-P6434_1988671:265-nf] \"I know that the law is spiritual,\" and having discussed at some length the violence of the flesh which frequently drives us to do what we would not, he at last continues: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" And again, \"So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And,[fn-64-P6435_1989121:266-nf] \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and death.\" And more clearly in what follows he teaches that Christians do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit:[fn-64-P6436_1989479:267-nf] \"For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,\" and so on to where he says,[fn-64-P6437_1990011:268-nf] \"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.\" If the[fn-64-P6438_1990318:269-nf] wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God, and they who are in the flesh cannot please God, I think that they who perform the functions of marriage love the wisdom of the flesh, and therefore are in the flesh. The Apostle being desirous to withdraw us from the flesh and to join us to the Spirit, says afterwards:[fn-64-P6439_1990653:270-nf] \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think according to chastity\"[fn-64-P6440_1991185:271-nf] (not soberly as the Latin versions badly render), but \"think,\" he says, \"according to chastity,\" for the Greek words are e0ij to swfronein. Let us consider what the Apostle says: \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.\" What he says is something like this-God indeed permits marriage, He permits second marriages, and if necessary, prefers even third marriages to fornication and adultery. But we who ought to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our reasonable service, should consider, not what God permits, but what He wishes: that we may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. It follows that what He merely permits is neither good, nor acceptable, nor perfect. And he gives his reasons for this advice:[fn-64-P6441_1992056:272-nf] \"Knowing the season, that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed. The night is far spent, and the day is at hand.\" And lastly: \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.\" God's will is one thing, His indulgence another. Whence, writing to the Corinthians, he says,[fn-64-P6442_1992505:273-nf] \"I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.\" He who[fn-64-P6443_1992812:274-nf] is in the merely animal state, and does not receive the things pertaining to the Spirit of God (for he is foolish, and cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned), he is not fed with the food of perfect chastity, but with the coarse milk of marriage. As through man came death, so also through man came the resurrection of the dead. As in Adam we all die, so in Christ we shall all be made alive. Under the law we served the old Adam, under the Gospel let us serve the new Adam. For the first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.[fn-64-P6444_1993681:275-nf] \"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" This is so clear that no explanation can make it clearer: \"Flesh and blood,\" he says, \"cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" If corruption attaches to all intercourse, and incorruption is characteristic of chastity, the rewards of chastity cannot belong to marriage.[fn-64-P6445_1994423:276-nf] \"For we know that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven. We are willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether in the body, or out of the body, to be well-pleasing unto God.\" And by way of more fully explaining what he did not wish them to be he says elsewhere:[fn-64-P6446_1994969:277-nf] \"I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.\" But if you choose to apply the words to the whole Assembly of believers, and in this betrothal to Christ include both married women, and the twice-married, and widows, and virgins, that also makes for us. For whilst he invites all to chastity and to the reward of virginity, he shows that virginity is more excellent than all these conditions. And again writing to the Galatians he says:[fn-64-P6447_1995465:278-nf] \"Because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\" Among the works of the law is marriage, and accordingly under it they are cursed who have no children. And if under the Gospel it is permitted to have children, it is one thing to make a concession to weakness another to hold out rewards to virtue.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":52,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_106_word_and_revelation_of_esdras","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"ANF-08","text":"For then neither brother pities brother, nor man wife, nor children parents, nor friends friends, nor a slave his master; for he who is the adversary of men shall come up from Tartarus, and shall show men many things. What shall I make of thee, Esdras? and wilt thou yet plead with me? And the prophet said: Lord, I shall not cease to plead with Thee. And God said: Number the flowers of the earth. If thou shalt be able to number them, thou art able also to plead with me. And the prophet said: Lord, I cannot number them. I wear human flesh; but I shall not cease to plead with Thee. I wish, Lord, to see also the under parts of Tartarus. And God said: Come down and see. And He gave me Michael, and Gabriel, and other thirty-four angels; and I went down eighty-five steps, and they brought me down five hundred steps, and I saw a fiery throne, and an old man sitting upon it; and his judgment was merciless. And I said to the angels: Who is this? and what is his sin? And they said to me: This is Herod, who for a time was a king, and ordered to put to death the children from two years old and under.[fn-84-P8471_2728997:20-nf] And I said: Woe to his soul! And again they took me down thirty steps, and I there saw boilings up of fire, and in them there was a multitude of sinners; and I heard their voice, but saw not their forms. And they took me down lower many steps, which I could not measure. And I there saw old men, and fiery pivots turning in their ears. And I said: Who are these? and what is their sin? And they said to me: These are they who would not listen.[fn-84-P8472_2729460:21-nf] And they took me down again other five hundred steps, and I there saw the worm that sleeps not, and fire burning up the sinners. And they took me down to the lowest part of destruction, and I saw there the twelve plagues of the abyss. And they took me away to the south, and I saw there a man hanging by the eyelids; and the angels kept scourging him. And I asked: Who is this? and what is his sin? And Michael the commander said to me: This is one who lay with his mother; for having put into practice a small wish, he has been ordered to be hanged. And they took me away to the north, and I saw there a man bound with iron chains. And I asked: Who is this? And he said to me: This is he who said, I am the Son of God, that made stones bread, and water wine. And the prophet said: My lord, let me know what is his form, and I shall tell the race of men, that they may not believe in him. And he said to me: The form of his countenance is like that of a wild beast; his right eye like the star that rises in the morning, and the other without motion; his mouth one cubit; his teeth span long; his fingers like scythes; the track of his feet of two spans; and in his face an inscription, Antichrist. He has been exalted to heaven; he shall go down to Hades.[fn-84-P8473_2730744:22-nf] At one time he shall become a child; at another, an old man. And the prophet said: Lord, and how dost Thou permit him, and he deceives the race of men? And God said: Listen, my prophet. He becomes both child and old man, and no one believes him that he is my beloved Son. And after this a trumpet, and the tombs shall be opened, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.[fn-84-P8474_2731142:23-nf] Then the adversary, hearing the dreadful threatening, shall be hidden in outer darkness. Then the heaven, and the earth, and the sea shall be destroyed. Then shall I burn the heaven eighty cubits, and the earth eight hundred cubits. And the prophet said: And how has the heaven sinned? And God said: Since[fn-84-P8475_2731468:24-nf] ...there is evil. And the prophet said: Lord, and the earth, how has it sinned? And God said: Since the adversary, having heard the dreadful threatening, shall be hidden, even on account of this will I melt the earth, and with it the opponent of the race of men. And the prophet said: Have mercy, Lord, upon the race of the Christians. And I saw a woman hanging, and four wild beasts sucking her breasts. And the angels said to me: She grudged to give her milk, but even threw her infants into the rivers. And I saw a dreadful darkness, and a night that had no stars nor moon; nor is there there young or old, nor brother with brother, nor mother with child, nor wife with husband. And I wept, and said: O Lord God, have mercy upon the sinners. And as I said this, there came a cloud and snatched me up, and carried me away again into the heavens. And I saw there many judgments; and I wept bitterly, and said: It is good for a man not to have come out of his mother's womb. And those who were in torment cried out, saying: Since thou hast come hither, O holy one of God, we have found a little remission. And the prophet said: Blessed are they that weep for their sins. And God said: Hear, O beloved Esdras. As a husbandman casts the seed of the corn into the ground, so also the man casts his seed into the parts of the woman. The first month it is all together; the second it increases in size; the third it gets hair; the fourth it gets nails; the fifth it is turned into milk;[fn-84-P8476_2732998:25-nf] and the sixth it is made ready, and receives life;[fn-84-P8477_2733070:26-nf] the seventh it is completely furnished; the ninth the barriers of the gate of the woman are opened; and it is born safe and sound into the earth. And the prophet said: Lord, it is good for man not to have been born. Woe to the human race then, when Thou shall come to judgment! And I said to the Lord: Lord, why hast Thou created man, and delivered him up to judgment? And God said, with a lofty proclamation: I will not by any means have mercy on those who transgress my covenant. And the prophet said Lord, where is Thy goodness? And God said: I have prepared all things for man's sake, and man does not keep my commandments. And the prophet said: Lord, reveal to me the judgments and paradise. And the angels took me away towards the east, and I saw the tree of life. And I saw there Enoch, and Elias, and Moses, and Peter, and Paul, and Luke, and Matthias, and all the righteous, and the patriarchs. And I saw there the keeping of the air within bounds, and the blowing of the winds, and the storehouses of the ice, and the eternal judgments. And I saw there a man hanging by the skull. And they said to me: This man removed landmarks. And I saw there great judgments.[fn-84-P8478_2734262:27-nf] And I said to the Lord: O Lord God, and what man, then, who has been born has not sinned? And they took me lower down into Tartarus, and I saw all the sinners lamenting and weeping and mourning bitterly. And I also wept, seeing the race of men thus tormented. Then God says to me: Knowest thou, Esdras, the names of the angels at the end of the world? Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Gabuthelon, Aker, Arphugitonos, Beburos, Zebuleon.","title":"Word and Revelation of Esdras","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"},{"chapter":15,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But how far (are we to treat) of Paul; since even John appears to give some secret countenance to the opposite side? as if in the Apocalypse he has manifestly assigned to fornication the auxiliary aid of repentance, where, to the angel of the Thyatirenes, the Spirit sends a message that He \"hath against him that he kept (in communion) the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophet, and teacheth,[fn-15-P1587_464312:232-nf] and seduceth my servants unto fornicating and eating of idolsacrifice. And I gave her bounteously a space of time, that she might enter upon repentance; nor is she willing to enter upon it on the count of fornication. Behold, I will give her into a bed, and her adulterers with herself into greatest pressure, unless they shall have repented of her works.\"[fn-15-P1588_464724:233-nf] I am content with the fact that, between apostles, there is a common agreement in rules of faith and of discipline.

This harmony of the Holy Spirit whoever observes, shall by Him be conducted into His meanings. For (the angel of the Thyatirene Church) was secretly introducing into the Church, and urging justly to repentance, an heretical woman, who had taken upon herself to teach what she had learnt from the Nicolaitans. For who has a doubt that an heretic, deceived by (a spurious baptismal) rite, upon discovering his mischance, and expiating it by repentance, both attains pardon and is restored to the bosom of the Church? Whence even among us, as being on a par with an heathen, nay even more than heathen, an heretic likewise, (such an one) is purged through the baptism of truth from each character,[fn-15-P1590_465792:235-nf] and admitted (to the Church). Or else, if you are certain that that woman had, after a living faith, subsequently expired, and turned heretic, in order that you may claim pardon as the result of repentance, not as it were for an heretical, but as it were for a believing, sinner: let her, I grant, repent; but with the view of ceasing from adultery, not however in the prospect of restoration (to Church-fellowship) as well. For this will be a repentance which we, too, acknowledge to be due much more (than you do); but which we reserve, for pardon, to God.[fn-15-P1591_466388:236-nf] ","title":"VII.

And a still more excellent way shew I unto you.\" And after discoursing more in detail of the graces of charity, he added:[fn-68-P6824_2166593:207-nf] \"Whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" And afterwards we read:[fn-68-P6825_2166957:208-nf] \"But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.\" And again:[fn-68-P6826_2167182:209-nf] \"I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues.\" And again:[fn-68-P6827_2167365:210-nf] \"I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all.\" Where there are different gifts, and one man is greater, another less, and all are called spiritual, they are all certainly sheep, and they stand on the right hand; but there is a difference between one sheep and another. It is humility that leads the Apostle Paul to say:[fn-68-P6828_2167716:211-nf] \"I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain: but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\" But the very fact of his thus humbling himself shows the possibility of there being apostles of higher or lower rank, and God is not unjust that lie will forget tim work of him who is called the chosen vessel of election, and who laboured more abundantly than they all, or assign equal rewards to unequal deserts. Afterwards we read,[fn-68-P6829_2168400:212-nf] \"As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be now alive. But each in his own order.\" If each is to rise in his own order, it follows that those who rise are of different degrees of merit.[fn-68-P6830_2168616:213-nf] \"All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.\" Like a learned commentator, you have explained this passage by saying that the spiritual differ from the carnal. It follows that in heaven there will be both spiritual and carnal persons, and not only will the sheep climb thither, but your goats also. \"One star,\" he says, \"differeth from another star in glory\": this is not the distinction of sheep and goat, but of sheep and sheep, star and star. Lastly, he says, \"there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon.\" But for this, you might maintain that the phrase one star from another star covers the whole human race; but he introduces the sun and moon, and you cannot possibly reckon them among the goats. \"So,\" says he, \"is also the resurrection of the dead\"-the just will shine with the brightness of the sun, and those of the next rank will glow with the splendour of the moon, so that one will be a Lucifer, another an Arcturus, a third an Orion, another Mazzaroth, or some other of the stars whose names are hollowed in the book of Job.[fn-68-P6831_2170121:214-nf] [fn-68-P6832_2170157:215-nf] \"For we all,\" he says, \"must be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\" And you cannot say that the mode of our manifestation before the judgment-seat of Christ is such that the good receive good things, the bad evil things; for he[fn-68-P6833_2170535:216-nf] teaches us in the same epistle that he who soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Surely he who sows more and he who sows less are both on the right side. And although they belong to the same class, that of the sower, yet they differ in respect of measure and number.

And I went along with the angel, and he brought me up into the heavens under the firmament; and I perceived and saw powers great and dreadful, full of wrath, and through the mouth of them a flame of fire coming out, and clothed in garments of fire. And I asked the angel: Who are these? And he said to me: These are they who are sent away to the souls of the sinners in the hour of necessity; for they have not believed that there is judgment and retribution. And I looked up into the heaven, and saw angels, whose faces shone like the sun, girded with golden girdles, having in their hands prizes, on which the name of the Lord was inscribed, full of all meekness and compassion. And I asked the angel: Who are these? And he answered and said to me: These are they who are sent forth in the day of the resurrection to bring the souls of the righteous,[fn-85-P8506_2745377:9-nf] who intrepidly walk according to God.[fn-85-P8507_2745441:10-nf] And I said to the angel: I wish to see the souls of the righteous and of the sinners, how they go out of the world.

And he said to me: Yes; for thus every unjust man disappears. And I looked, and saw a cloud of fire wrapped over all the world; and I said: What is this, my lord? And he said to me: This is the unrighteousness mingled with the destruction of the sinners. And I wept, and said to the angel: I wished to see the departures of the righteous and of the sinners, in what manner they go out of the world. And the angel says to me: Paul, look down, and see what thou hast asked. And I looked, and saw one of the sons of men falling near death. And the angel says to me: This is a righteous man, and, behold, all his works stand beside him in the hour of his necessity.[fn-85-P8508_2746414:11-nf] And there were beside him good angels, and along with them also evil angels. And the evil angels indeed found no place in him, but the good took possession of[fn-85-P8509_2746598:12-nf] the soul of the righteous man, and said to it: Take note of the body whence thou art coming out; for it is necessary for thee again to return to it in the day of the resurrection, that thou mayst receive what God hath promised to the righteous. And the good angels who had received the soul of the righteous man, saluted it, as being well known to them. And it went with them; and the Spirit came forth to meet them, saying: Come, soul, enter into the place of the resurrection, which God hath prepared for His righteous ones. And the angel said to me: Look down to the earth, and behold the soul of the impious, how it goes forth from its tabernacle, which has provoked God to anger, saying, Let us eat and drink;[fn-85-P8510_2747338:13-nf] for who is it that has gone down to Hades, and come up and announced that there is judgment and retribution? And take heed, and see all his works which he has done standing before him. And the evil angels came and the good.

And when it had gone forth from its tabernacle, the angel who had lived along with it ran up to it, saying to it: O wretched soul, whither goest thou? I am he who each day wrote down thy sins. Thou hast destroyed the time of repentance; be exceedingly ashamed. And when it came, all the angels saw it, and cried out with one voice, saying: Woe to thee, wretched soul! what excuse hast thou come to give to God? And the angel of that soul said: Weep for it, all of you, along with me. And the angel came up, and worshipped the Lord, saying: Lord, behold the soul which has dwelt in wickedness in its time, and in its temporary life; do to it according to Thy decision. And there came a voice to that soul, saying: Where is the fruit of thy righteousness? And it was silent,[fn-85-P8511_2748671:14-nf] not being able to give an answer.

And a voice came to it. saying: Thou wast altogether merciless, and for this reason thou hast been delivered up to such an angel. Confess thy sins which thou hast done in the world. And that soul said: I have not sinned, O righteous Judge. And the Lord said to that soul: Verily thou seemest as if thou wert in the world, and weft hiding thy deeds from men. Knowest thou not that whensoever any one dies, his deeds run before him, whether they are good or evil? And when it heard this, it was silent. And I heard the Judge saying: Let the angel come, having in his hands the record of thy sins. And the Judge says to the angel: I say to thee the angel, Disclose all. Say what he has done five years before his death. By myself I swear to thee, that in the first period of his life there was forgetfulness of all his former sins. And the angel answered and said: Lord, command the souls to stand beside their angels; and that same hour they stood beside them. And the lord of that soul said: Take note of these souls, and whether thou hast in any way sinned against them. And it answered and said: Lord, a year has not been completed since I killed the one and lived with the other. And not only this, but I also wronged it. And the Lord said to it: Knowest thou not that he who wrongs any one in the world is kept, as soon as he dies, in the place until he whom he has wronged come, and both shall be judged before me, and each receive according to his works?

The First Good is in its nature infinite, and so it follows of necessity that the participation in the enjoyment of it will be infinite also, for more will be always being grasped, and yet something beyond that which has been grasped will always be discovered, and this search will never overtake its Object, because its fund is as inexhaustible as the growth of that which participates in it is ceaseless[fn-6-P690_313231:69-nf] .","title":"Book I","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":15,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_18_book_xii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"For whereas there is one form which is given from without to every bodily substance,-such as the form which is constructed by potters and smiths, and that class of artists who paint and fashion forms like the body of animals,-but another and internal form which is not itself constructed, but, as the efficient cause, produces not only the natural bodily forms, but even the life itself of the living creatures, and which proceeds from the secret and hidden choice of an intelligent and living nature,-let that first-mentioned form be attributed to every artificer, but this latter to one only, God, the Creator and Originator who made the world itself and the angels, without the help of world or angels. For the same divine and, so to speak, creative energy, which cannot be made, but makes, and which gave to the earth and sky their roundness,-this same divine, effective, and creative energy gave their roundness to the eye and to the apple; and the other natural objects which we anywhere see, received also their form, not from without, but from the secret and profound might of the Creator, who said, \"Do not I fill heaven and earth?[fn-21-P2102_1207969:43-nf] and whose wisdom it is that \"reacheth from one end to another mightily; and sweetly doth she order all things.\"[fn-21-P2103_1208176:44-nf] Wherefore I know not what kind of aid the angels, themselves created first, afforded to the Creator in making other things. I cannot ascribe to them what perhaps they cannot do, neither ought I to deny them such faculty as they have. But, by their leave, I attribute the creating and originating work which gave being to all natures to God, to whom they themselves thankfully ascribe their existence. We do not call gardeners the creators of their fruits, for we read, \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.\"[fn-21-P2104_1208767:45-nf] Nay, not even the earth itself do we call a creator, though she seems to be the prolific mother of all things which she aids in germinating and bursting forth from the seed, and which she keeps rooted in her own breast; for we likewise read, \"God giveth it a body, as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body.[fn-21-P2105_1209110:46-nf] \" We ought not even to call a woman the creatress of her own offspring; for He rather is its creator who said to His servant, \"Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.\"[fn-21-P2106_1209304:47-nf] And although the various mental emotions of a pregnant woman do produce in the fruit of her womb similar qualities,-as Jacob with his peeled wands caused piebald sheep to be produced,-yet the mother as little creates her offspring as she created herself. Whatever bodily or seminal causes, then, may be used for the production of things, either by the cooperation of angels, men, or the lower animals, or by sexual generation; and whatever power the desires and mental emotions of the mother have to produce in the tender and plastic foetus corresponding lineaments and colors; yet the natures themselves, which are thus variously affected, are the production of none but the most high God. It is His occult power which pervades all things, and is present in all without being contaminated, which gives being to all that is, and modifies and limits its existence; so that without Him it would not be thus, or thus, nor would have any being at all.[fn-21-P2107_1210273:48-nf] If, then, in regard to that outward form which the workman's hand imposes on his work, we do not say that Rome and Alexandria were built by masons and architects, but by the kings by whose will, plan, and resources they were built, so that the one has Romulus, the other Alexander, for its founder; with how much greater reason ought we to say that God alone is the Author of all natures, since He neither uses for His work any material which was not made by Him, nor any workmen who were not also made by Him, and since, if He were, so to speak, to withdraw from created things His creative power, they would straightway relapse into the nothingness in which they were before they were created? \"Before,\" I mean, in respect of eternity, not of time.

For if he uses such expressions with reference to vain idols and to the erroneous conceptions of those who worship them (even as Paul assures us that there is no agreement between Christ and Belial, and no fellowship between the temple of God and idols[fn-10-P1017_548895:49-nf] ) we agree with him. But if by these assertions he means to sever the Only-begotten God from the Godhead of the Father, let him be informed that he is providing us with a dilemma that may be turned against himself to refute his own impiety. For either he denies the Only-begotten God to be God at all, that he may preserve for the Father those prerogatives of deity which (according to him) are incapable of being shared with the Son, and thus is convicted as a transgressor by denying the God Whom Christians worship, or if he were to grant that the Son also is God, yet not agreeing in nature with the true God, he would be necessarily obliged to acknowledge that he maintains Gods sundered from one another by the difference of their natures. Let him choose which of these he will,-either to deny the Godhead of the Son, or to introduce into his creed a plurality of Gods. For whichever of these he chooses, it is all one as regards impiety: for we who are initiated intothe mystery of godliness by the Divinely inspired words of the Scripture do not see between the Father and the Son a partnership of Godhead, but unity, inasmuch as the Lord hath taught us this by His own words, when He saith, \"I and the Father are one[fn-10-P1018_550159:50-nf] ,\" and \"he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-10-P1019_550229:51-nf] .\" For if He were not of the same nature as the Father, how could He either have had in Himself that which was different[fn-10-P1020_550371:52-nf] ? or how could He have shown in Himself that which was unlike, if the foreign and alien nature did not receive the stamp of that which was of a different kind from itself? But he says, \"nor has He a divider of His glory.\" Herein he speaks in accordance with the fact, even though he does not know what he is saying: for the Son does not divide the glory with the Father, but has the glory of the Father in its entirety, even as the Father has all the glory of the Son. For thus He spake to the Father \"All Mine are Thine and Thine are Mine[fn-10-P1021_550934:53-nf] .\" Wherefore also He says that He will appear on the Judgment Day \"in the glory of the Father[fn-10-P1022_551051:54-nf] ,\" when He will render to every man according to his works. And by this phrase He shows the unity of nature that subsists between them. For as \"there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon[fn-10-P1023_551278:55-nf] ,\" because of the difference between the natures of those luminaries (since if both had the same glory there would not be deemed to be any difference in their nature), so He Who foretold of Himself that He would appear in the glory of the Father indicated by the identity of glory their community of nature.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":15,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The mighty Paul, knowing that the Only-begotten God, Who has the pre-eminence in all things[fn-10-P1067_578878:86-nf] , is the author and cause of all good, bears witness to Him that not only was the creation of all existent things wrought by Him, but that when the original creation of man had decayed and vanished away[fn-10-P1068_579102:87-nf] , to use his own language, and another new creation was wrought in Christ, in this too no other than He took the lead, but He is Himself the first-born of all that new creation of men which is effected by the Gospel. And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, \"first-born of all creation[fn-10-P1069_579579:88-nf] ,\" another time, \"the first-born among many brethren[fn-10-P1070_579649:89-nf] ,\" again, \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1071_579705:90-nf] ,\" and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other words, saying, \"But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him[fn-10-P1072_579955:91-nf] .\" Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase \"first-born of all creation.\" For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become \"the first-born among many brethren?\" in what sense does He become \"the first-born from the dead?\" Assuredly this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, \"He Who for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood[fn-10-P1073_580545:92-nf] ,\" purposing to change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the \"first-fruits of them that slept[fn-10-P1074_581130:93-nf] \" and the \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1075_581186:94-nf] ,\" in that He first by His own act loosed the pains of death[fn-10-P1076_581264:95-nf] , so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration[fn-10-P1077_581533:96-nf] He became \"the first-born among many brethren,\" and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He obtains the name of the \"first-born from the dead,\" so having in all things the pre-eminence, after that \"all old things,\" as the apostle says, \"have passed away[fn-10-P1078_581877:97-nf] ,\" He becomes the first-born of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life[fn-10-P1079_582141:98-nf] , the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, \"Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-10-P1080_582374:99-nf] .\" In these words He sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man.

They will say of course that \"all things were made by Him[fn-12-P1248_675231:232-nf] ,\" and that in the term \"all things\" \"this Spirit also\" is included. Our answer to them shall be this, All things were made by Him, that were made. Now the things that were made, as Paul tells us, were things visible and invisible, thrones, authorities, dominions, principalities, powers, and among those included under the head of thrones and powers are reckoned by Paul the Cherubim and Seraphim[fn-12-P1249_675654:233-nf] : so far does the term \"all things\" extend. But of the Holy Spirit, as being above the nature of things that have come into being, Paul said not a word in his enumeration of existing things, not indicating to us by his words either His subordination or His coming into being; but just as the prophet calls the Holy Spirit \"good,\" and \"right,\" and \"guiding[fn-12-P1250_676074:234-nf] \" (indicating by the word \"guiding\" the power of control), even so the apostle ascribes independent authority to the dignity of the Spirit, when he affirms that He works all in all as He wills[fn-12-P1251_676555:235-nf] . Again, the Lord makes manifest the Spirit's independent power and operation in His discourse with Nicodemus, when He says, \"The Spirit breatheth where He willeth[fn-12-P1252_676746:236-nf] .\" How is it then that Eunomius goes so far as to define that He also is one of the things that came into being by the Son, condemned to eternal subjection. For he describes Him as \"once for all made subject,\" enthralling the guiding and governing Spirit in I know not what form of subjection. For this expression of \"subjection\" has many significations in Holy Scripture, and is understood and used with many varieties of meaning. For the Psalmist says that even irrational nature is put in subjection[fn-12-P1253_677272:237-nf] , and brings under the same term those who are overcome in war[fn-12-P1254_677368:238-nf] , while the apostle bids servants to be in subjection to their own masters[fn-12-P1255_677464:239-nf] , and that those who are placed over the priesthood should have their children in subjection[fn-12-P1256_677576:240-nf] , as their disorderly conduct brings discredit upon their fathers, as in the case of the sons of Eli the priest. Again, he speaks of the subjection of all men to God, when we all, being united to one another by the faith, become one body of the Lord Who is in all, as the subjection of the Son to the Father, when the adoration paid to the Son by all things with one accord, by things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, redounds to the glory of the Father; as Paul says elsewhere, \"To Him every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father[fn-12-P1257_678293:241-nf] .\" For when this takes place, the mighty wisdom of Paul affirms that the Son, Who is in all, is subject to the Father by virtue of the subjection of those in whom He is. What kind of \"subjection once for all\" Eunomius asserts of the Holy Spirit, it is thus impossible to learn from the phrase which he has thrown out,-whether he means the subjection of irrational creatures, or of captives, or of servants, or of children who are kept in order, or of those who are saved by subjection. For the subjection of men to God is salvation for those who are so made subject, according to the voice of the prophet, who says that his soul is subject to God, since of Him cometh salvation by subjection[fn-12-P1258_679098:242-nf] , so that subjection is the means of averting perdition. As therefore the help of the healing art is sought eagerly by the sick, so is subjection by those who are in need of salvation. But of what life does the Holy Spirit, that quickeneth all things, stand in need, that by subjection He should obtain salvation for Himself? Since then it is not on the strength of any Divine utterance that he asserts such an attribute of the Spirit, nor yet is it as a consequence of probable arguments that he has launched this blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, it must be plain at all events to sensible men that he vents his impiety against Him without any warrant whatsoever, unsupported as it is by any authority from Scripture or by any logical consequence.

Again and again, my reader, I admonish you to be patient, and to learn what I also have learnt through patience; and yet, before I take the veil off the dragon's face, and briefly explain Origen's views respecting the resurrection (for you cannot know the efficacy of the antidote unless you see clearly what the poison is), I beg you to read his statements with caution, and to go over them again and again. Mark well that, though he nine times speaks of the resurrection of the body, he has not once introduced the resurrection of the flesh, and you may fairly suspect that he left it out on purpose. Well, Origen says in several places, and especially in his fourth book \"Of the Resurrection,\" and in the \"Exposition of the First Psalm,\" and inthe \"Miscellanies,\" that there is a double error common in the Church, in which both we and the heretics are implicated: \"We, in our simplicity and fondness for the flesh, say that the same bones, and blood, and flesh, in a word, limbs and features, and the whole bodily structure, rise again at the last day: so that, forsooth, we shall walk with our feet, work with our hands, see with our eyes, hear with our ears, and carry about with us a belly never satisfied, and a stomach which digests our food. Consequently, believing this, we say that we must eat, drink, perform the offices of nature, marry wives, beget children. For what is the use of organs of generation, if there is to be no marriage? For what purpose are teeth, if the food is not to be masticated? What is the good of a belly and of meats, if, according to the Apostle, both it and they are to be destroyed? And the same Apostle again exclaims,[fn-70-P7081_2324838:56-nf] `Flesh and blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, nor shall corruption inherit incorruption.'\" This, according to him, is what we in our rustic innocence maintain. But as for the heretics, amongst whom are Marcion, Apelles, Valentinus, Manes (a synomym for Mania), he says that they utterly deny the resurrection of the flesh and of the body, and allow salvation only to the soul, and hold that it is futile for us to say that we shall rise after the pattern of our Lord, since our Lord also Himself rose again in a phantom body, and not only His resurrection, but His very nativity was docetic or imaginary; that is, more apparent than real. Origen himself is dissatisfied with both opinions. He says that he shuns both errors, that of the flesh, which our party maintain, and that of the phantoms, maintained by the heretics, because both sides go to the opposite extremes, some wishing to be the same that they have been, others denying altogether the resurrection of the body. \"There are four elements,\" he says, \"known to philosophers and physicians: earth, water, air, and fire, and out of these all things and human bodies are compacted. We find earth in flesh, air in the breath, water in the moisture of the body, fire in its heat. When, then, the soul, at the command of God, lets go this perishing and feeble body, little by little all things return to their parent substances: flesh is again absorbed into the earth, the breath is mingled with the air, the moisture returns to the depths, the heat escapes to the ether. And as if you throw into the sea a pint of milk and wine, and wish again to separate what is mixed together, although the wine and milk which you threw in is not lost, and yet it is impossible to keep separate what was poured out; so the substance of flesh and blood does not perish, indeed, so far as concerns the original matter, yet they cannot again become the former structure, nor can they be altogether the same that they were.\" Observe that when such things are said, the firmness of the flesh, the fluidity of the blood, the density of the sinews, the interlacing of the veins, and the hardness of the bones is denied.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"26. \"For another reason,\" he says, \"we confess the resurrection of our bodies, those which have been laid in the grave and have turned to dust; Paul's body will be that of Paul, Peter's that of Peter, and each will have his own; for it is not right that souls should sin in one body and be tormented in another, nor is it worthy of the Righteous Judge that one body should shed its blood for Christ and another be crowned.\" Who, hearing this, would think he denied the resurrection of the flesh? \"And,\" he says. \"every seed has its own law of being inherent in it by the gift of God, the Creator, which law contains in embryonic form the future growth.

The true confession of the resurrection declares that the flesh will be glorious, but without destroying its reality. And when the Apostle says,[fn-71-P7101_2338505:72-nf] \"This is corruptible and mortal,\" his words denote this very body, that is to say, the flesh which was then seen. But when he adds that it puts on incorruption and immortality, he does not say that that which is put on, that is the clothing, does away with the body which it adorns in glory, but that it makes that body glorious, which before lacked glory; so that the more worthless robe of mortality and weakness being laid aside, we may be clothed with the gold of immortality, and, so to speak, with the blessedness of strength as well as virtue; since we wish not to be stripped of the flesh, but to put on over it the vesture of glory, and desire to be clothed upon with our house, which is from heaven, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. Certainly, no one is clothed upon who was not previously clothed. Accordingly, our Lord was not so transfigured on the mountain that He lost His hands and feet and other members, and suddenly began to roll along in a round shape like that of the sun or a ball; but the same members glowed with the brightness of the sun and blinded the eyes of the Apostles. Hence, also, His garments were changed, but so as to become white and glistening, not aërial, for I suppose you do not intend to maintain that His clothes also were spiritual.[fn-71-P7102_2339814:73-nf] The Evangelist adds that His face shone like the sun; but when mention is made of His face, I reckon that His other members were beheld as well. Enoch was translated in the flesh; Elias was carried up to heaven in the flesh. They are not dead, they are inhabitants of Paradise, and even there retain the members with which they were rapt away and translated. What we aim at in fasting, they have through fellowship with God.

I pray you, who use such elaborate arguments against the resurrection, let us have some simple talk together. Do you believe that our Lord really rose again in the same body in which He died and was buried, or do you not believe it? If you believe it, why do you make propositions which lead to the denial of the resurrection? If you do not believe, you who thus try to deceive the minds of the ignorant, and parade the word resurrection, though you mean nothing by it, listen to me. Not long ago, a certain disciple of Marcion said: \"Woe to him who rises again with this flesh and these bones!\" Our heart at once with joy replied,[fn-71-P7157_2363285:121-nf] \"We are buried together, and we shall rise together with Christ through baptism.\" \"Do you speak of the resurrection of the soul, or of the flesh?\" I answered, \"Not that of the soul alone, but that of the flesh, which, together with the soul, is born again in the layer.

Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.'[fn-25-P2539_1018195:80-nf] And in another passage: `I shall be blameless with Him.'[fn-25-P2540_1018271:81-nf] And yet again: `Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'[fn-25-P2541_1018379:82-nf] To the same effect it is written in Solomon: `The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.'\"[fn-25-P2542_1018531:83-nf] Now some of these passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, \"Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.\"[fn-25-P2543_1019210:84-nf] So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"108","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Then again, as for what he says, \"For I have kept His ways, and have not turned aside from His commandments, nor will I depart from them; \"[fn-25-P2588_1029613:110-nf] he has kept God's ways who does not so turn aside as to forsake them, but makes progress by running his course therein; although, weak as he is, he sometimes stumbles or falls, onward, however, he still goes, sinning less and less until he reaches the perfect state in which he will sin no more. For in no other way could he make progress, except by keeping His ways. The man, indeed, who declines from these and becomes an apostate at last, is certainly not he who, although he has sin, yet never ceases to persevere in fighting against it until he arrives at the home where there shall remain no more conflict with death. Well now, it is in our present struggle therewith that we are clothed with the righteousness in which we here live by faith,-clothed with it as it were with a breastplate.[fn-25-P2589_1030435:111-nf] Judgment also we take on ourselves; and even when it is against us, we turn it round to our own behalf; for we become our own accusers and condemn our sins: whence that scripture which says, \"The righteous man accuses himself at the beginning of his speech.\"[fn-25-P2590_1030714:112-nf] Hence also he says: \"I put on righteousness, and clothed myself with judgment like a mantle.\"[fn-25-P2591_1030832:113-nf] Our vesture at present no doubt is wont to be armour for war rather than garments of peace, while concupiscence has still to be subdued; it will be different by and by, when our last enemy death shall be destroyed,[fn-25-P2592_1031069:114-nf] and our righteousness shall be full and complete, without an enemy to molest us more.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":56,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_19_book_xiii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"The apostle, wishing to show how hurtful a thing sin is, when grace does not aid us, has not hesitated to say that the strength of sin is that very law by which sin is prohibited. \"The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.\"[fn-21-P2144_1227123:6-nf] Most certainly true; for prohibition increases the desire of illicit action, if righteousness is not so loved that the desire of sin is conquered by that love. But unless divine grace aid us, we cannot love nor delight in true righteousness. But lest the law should be thought to be an evil, since it is called the strength of sin, the apostle, when treating a similar question in another place, says, \"The law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is holy made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.\"[fn-21-P2145_1227812:7-nf] Exceeding, he says, because the transgression is more heinous when through the increasing lust of sin the law itself also is despised. Why have we thought it worth while to mention this? For this reason, because, as the law is not an evil when it increases the lust of those who sin, so neither is death a good thing when it increases the glory of those who suffer it, since either the former is abandoned wickedly, and makes transgressors, or the latter is embraced, for the truth's sake, and makes martyrs. And thus the law is indeed good, because it is prohibition of sin, and death is evil because it is the wages of sin; but as wicked men make an evil use not only of evil, but also of good things, so the righteous make a good use not only of good, but also of evil things. Whence it comes to pass that the wicked make an ill use of the law, though the law is good; and that the good die well, though death is an evil.","title":"Book XIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_103_letter_xlix_letter_to_dracontius_written_a_d_354_or_355_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4.

But, as it was `woe to me' if he did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his converts as his joy and crown[fn-98-P9848_3517378:16-nf] . This explains why the saint[fn-98-P9849_3517427:17-nf] was zealous to preach as far as Illyricum, and not to shrink from proceeding to Rome[fn-98-P9850_3517555:18-nf] , or even going as far as the Spains[fn-98-P9851_3517609:19-nf] , in order that the more he laboured, he might receive so much the greater reward for his labour.

We, however, claim this (operation) for the soul, which we acknowledge to be an indivisible simple substance, and therefore we must call it spirit in a definitive sense-not because of its condition, but of its action; not in respect of its nature, but of its operation; because it respires, and not because it is spirit in any especial sense.[fn-26-P2671_891545:73-nf] For to blow or breathe is to respire. So that we are driven to describe, by (the term which indicates this respiration-that is to say) spirit-the soul which we hold to be, by the propriety of its action, breath. Moreover, we properly and especially insist on calling it breath (or spirit), in opposition to Hermogenes, who derives the soul from matter instead of from the afflatus or breath of God. He, to be sure, goes flatly against the testimony of Scripture, and with this view converts breath into spirit, because he cannot believe that the (creature on which was breathed the) Spirit of God fell into sin, and then into condemnation; and therefore he would conclude that the soul came from matter rather than from the Spirit or breath of God. For this reason, we on our side even from that passage, maintain the soul to be breath and not the spirit, in the scriptural and distinctive sense of the spirit; and here it is with regret that we apply the term spirit at all in the lower sense, in consequence of the identical action of respiring and breathing. In that passage, the only question is about the natural substance; to respire being an act of nature. I would not tarry a moment longer on this point, were it not for those heretics who introduce into the soul some spiritual germ which passes my comprehension: (they make it to have been) conferred upon the soul by the secret liberality of her mother Sophia (Wisdom), without the knowledge of the Creator.[fn-26-P2672_893054:74-nf] But (Holy) Scripture, which has a better knowledge of the soul's Maker, or rather God, has told us nothing more than that God breathed on man's face the breath of life, and that man became a living soul, by means of which he was both to live and breathe; at the same time making a sufficiently clear distinction between the spirit and the soul,[fn-26-P2673_893449:75-nf] in such passages as the following, wherein God Himself declares: \"My Spirit went forth from me, and I made the breath of each. And the breath of my Spirit became soul.\"[fn-26-P2674_893725:76-nf] And again: \"He giveth breath unto the people that are on the earth, and Spirit to them that walk thereon.\"[fn-26-P2675_893876:77-nf] First of all there comes the (natural) soul, that is to say, the breath, to the people that are on the earth,-in other words, to those who act carnally in the flesh; then afterwards comes the Spirit to those who walk thereon,-that is, who subdue the works of the flesh; because the apostle also says, that \"that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, (or in possession of the natural soul, ) and afterward that which is spiritual.\"[fn-26-P2676_894348:78-nf] For, inasmuch as Adam straightway predicted that \"great mystery of Christ and the church,\"[fn-26-P2677_894459:79-nf] when he said, \"This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall become one flesh,\"[fn-26-P2678_894673:80-nf] he experienced the influence of the Spirit. For there fell upon him that ecstasy, which is the Holy Ghost's operative virtue of prophecy. And even the evil spirit too is an influence which comes upon a man. Indeed, the Spirit of God not more really \"turned Saul into another man,\"[fn-26-P2679_894976:81-nf] that is to say, into a prophet, when \"people said one to another, What is this which is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? \"[fn-26-P2680_895142:82-nf] than did the evil spirit afterwards turn him into another man-in other words, into an apostate. Judas likewise was for a long time reckoned among the elect (apostles), and was even appointed to the office of their treasurer; he was not yet the traitor, although he was become fraudulent; but afterwards the devil entered into him. Consequently, as the spirit neither of God nor of the devil is naturally planted with a man's soul at his birth, this soul must evidently exist apart and alone, previous to the accession to it of either spirit: if thus apart and alone, it must also be simple and un-compounded as regards its substance; and therefore it cannot respire from any other cause than from the actual condition of its own substance.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":57,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"ANF-03","text":"By ourselves the lower regions (of Hades) are not supposed to be a bare cavity, nor some subterranean sewer of the world, but a vast deep space in the interior of the earth, and a concealed recess in its very bowels; inasmuch as we read that Christ in His death spent three days in the heart of the earth,[fn-30-P3043_1098549:310-nf] that is, in the secret inner recess which is hidden in the earth, and enclosed by the earth, and superimposed on the abysmal depths which lie still lower down.

How is it that the most heroic martyr Perpetua on the day of her passion saw only her fellow-martyrs there, in the revelation which she received of Paradise, if it were not that the sword which guarded the entrance permitted none to go in thereat, except those who had died in Christ and not in Adam? A new death for God, even the extraordinary one for Christ, is admitted into the reception-room of mortality, specially altered and adapted to receive the new-comer. Observe, then, the difference between a heathen and a Christian in their death: if you have to lay down your life for God, as the Comforter[fn-30-P3053_1101709:320-nf] counsels, it is not in gentle fevers and on soft beds, but in the sharp pains of martyrdom: you must take up the cross and bear it after your Master, as He has Himself instructed you.[fn-30-P3054_1101912:321-nf] The sole key to unlock Paradise is your own life's blood.[fn-30-P3055_1101992:322-nf] You have a treatise by us,[fn-30-P3056_1102130:323-nf] (on Paradise), in which we have established the position that every soul is detained in safe keeping in Hades until the day of the Lord.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"First, we must see what it is to live after the flesh, and what to live after the spirit. For any one who either does not recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language of sacred Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose that the Epicurean philosophers live after the flesh, because they place man's highest good in bodily pleasure; and that those others do so who have been of opinion that in some form or other bodily good is man's supreme good; and that the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or philosophizing on the subject, are so prone to lust that they cannot delight in any pleasure save such as they receive from bodily sensations: and he may suppose that the Stoics, who place the supreme good of men in the soul, live after the spirit; for what is man's soul, if not spirit? But in the sense of the divine Scripture both are proved to live after the flesh.

And therefore that place too of the Apostle John must be understood rather according to this image, when he says, \"We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;\" because he spoke too of Him of whom be had said, \"We are the sons of God.\"[fn-18-P1886_941991:75-nf] And the immortality of the flesh will be perfected in that moment of the resurrection, of which the Apostle Paul says, \"In the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\"[fn-18-P1887_942246:76-nf] For in that very twinkling of an eye, before the judgment, the spiritual body shall rise again in power, in incorruption, in glory, which is now sown a natural body in weakness, in corruption, in dishonor.

And then, in bringing to a close this weighty and protracted discourse, He said, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" The beginning of such tribulation was to be found in that whereof, in order to show that they were infants, to whom, as still wanting in intelligence, and mistaking one thing for another, all the great and divine things He had said were little better than proverbs, He had previously said, \"Do ye now believe? Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own.\" Such, I say, was the beginning of the tribulation, but not in the same measure of their perseverance. For in adding, \"and ye shall leave me alone,\" He did not mean that they would be of such a character in the subsequent tribulation, which they should have to endure in the world after His ascension, as thus to desert Him; but that in Him they should have peace by still abiding in Him. But on the occasion of His apprehension, not only did they outwardly abandon His bodily presence, but they mentally abandoned their faith. And to this it is that His words have reference, \"Do ye now believe? Behold, the hour cometh, that ye shall be scattered to your own, and shall leave me:\" as if He had said, You will then be so confounded as to leave behind you even what you now believe. For they fell into such despair and such a death, so to speak, of their old faith, as was apparent in the case of Cleophas, who, after His resurrection, unaware that he was speaking with Himself, and narrating what had befallen Him, said, \"We trusted that it had been He who should have redeemed Israel.\"[fn-33-P3397_1887592:1-nf] That was the way in which they then left Him, abandoning even the very faith wherewith they had formerly believed in Him. But in that tribulation, which they encountered after His glorification and they themselves had received the Holy Spirit, they did not leave Him: and though they fled from city to city, from Himself they did not flee; but in order that, while having tribulation in the world, they might have peace in Him, instead of being fugitives from Him, it was rather Himself that they made their refuge. For in receiving the Holy Spirit, there was wrought in them the very state described to them now in the words, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" They were of good cheer, and they conquered. But in whom, save in Him? For He had not overcome the world, were it still to overcome His members. Hence said the apostle, \"Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory;\" and immediately added, \"through our Lord Jesus Christ:\"[fn-33-P3398_1888558:2-nf] through Him who had said to His own, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"","title":"Tractate CIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":58,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"ANF-04","text":"9. The teaching of the apostles was surely in everything according to the mind of God: they forgot and omitted nothing of the Gospel. Where, then, do you show that they renewed the command to flee from city to city? In fact, it was utterly impossible that they should have laid down anything so utterly opposed to their own examples as a command to flee, while it was just from bonds, or the islands in which, for confessing, not fleeing from the Christian name, they were confined, they wrote their letters to the Churches. Paul[fn-19-P1974_594332:34-nf] bids us support the weak, but most certainly it is not when they flee. For how can the absent be supported by you? By bearing with them? Well, he says that people must be supported, if anywhere they have committed a fault through the weakness of their faith, just as (he enjoins) that we should comfort the faint-hearted; he does not say, however, that they should be sent into exile. But when he urges us not to give place to evil,[fn-19-P1975_594786:35-nf] he does not offer the suggestion that we should take to our heels, he only teaches that passion should be kept under restraint; and if he says that the time must be redeemed, because the days are evil,[fn-19-P1976_595006:36-nf] he wishes us to gain a lengthening of life, not by flight, but by wisdom. Besides, he who bids us shine as sons of light,[fn-19-P1977_595145:37-nf] does not bid us hide away out of sight as sons of darkness. He commands us to stand stedfast,[fn-19-P1978_595259:38-nf] certainly not to act an opposite. part by fleeing; and to be girt, not to play the fugitive or oppose the Gospel. He points out weapons, too, which persons who intend to run away would not require. And among these he notes the shield[fn-19-P1979_595513:39-nf] too, that ye may be able to quench the darts of the devil, when doubtless ye resist him, and sustain his assaults in their utmost force. Accordingly John also teaches that we must lay down our lives for the brethren;[fn-19-P1980_595748:40-nf] much more, then, we must do it for the Lord. This cannot be fulfilled by those who flee. Finally, mindful of his own Revelation, in which he had heard the doom of the fearful, (and so) speaking from personal knowledge, he warns us that fear must be put away. \"There is no fear,\" says he, \"in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear has torment\"-the fire of the lake, no doubt. \"He that feareth is not perfect in love\"[fn-19-P1981_596201:41-nf] -to wit, the love of God. And yet who will flee from persecution, but he who fears? Who will fear, but he who has not loved? Yes; and if you ask counsel of the Spirit, what does He approve more than that utterance of the Spirit? For, indeed, it incites all almost to go and offer themselves in martyrdom, not to flee from it; so that we also make mention of it. If you are exposed to public infamy, says he, it is for your good; for he who is not exposed to dishonour among men is sure to be so before the Lord. Do not be ashamed; righteousness brings you forth into the public gaze. Why should you be ashamed of gaining glory? The opportunity is given you when you are before the eyes of men. So also elsewhere: seek not to die on bridal beds, nor in miscarriages, nor in soft fevers, but to die the martyr's death, that He may be glorified who has suffered for you.","title":"IX.

Now this, to be sure, is the very gist of our question; for undoubtedly in this grace of apostleship all those graces are contained. For it was neither convenient nor right that an apostle should not possess the gift of prophecy, nor be a teacher, nor be illustrious for miracles and the gifts of healings, nor furnish needful helps, nor provide governments over the churches, nor excel in diversities of tongues. All these functions the one name of apostleship embraces. Let us, therefore, consult the man himself, nay listen wholly to him. Let us say to him: \"Holy Apostle Paul, the monk Pelagius declares that thou wast worthy to receive all the graces of thine apostleship. What dost thou say thyself?\" He answers: \"I am not worthy to be called an apostle.\" Shall I then, under pretence of honouring Paul, in a matter concerning Paul, dare to believe Pelagius in preference to Paul? I will not do so; for if I did, I should only prove to be more onerous to myself than honouring to him.[fn-30-P3027_1172556:115-nf] Let us hear also why he is not worthy to be called an apostle: \"Because,\" says he, \"I persecuted the Church of God.\"[fn-30-P3028_1172775:116-nf] Now, were we to follow up the idea here expressed, who would not judge that he rather deserved from Christ condemnation, instead of an apostolic call? Who could so love the preacher as not to loathe the persecutor? Well, therefore, and truly does he say of himself: \"I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.\" As thou wroughtest then such evil, how camest thou to earn such good? Let all men hear his answer: \"But by the grace of God, I am what I am.\" Is there, then, no other way in which grace is commended, than because it is conferred on an unworthy recipient? \"And His grace,\" he adds, \"which was bestowed on me was not in vain.\"[fn-30-P3029_1173470:117-nf] He says this as a lesson to others also, to show the freedom of the will, when he says: \"We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.\"[fn-30-P3030_1173684:118-nf] Whence however does he derive his proof, that \"His grace bestowed on himself was not in vain,\" except from the fact which he goes on to mention: \"But I laboured more abundantly than they all?\"[fn-30-P3031_1173898:119-nf] So it seems he did not labour in order to receive grace, but he received grace in order that he might labour. And thus, when unworthy, he gratuitously received grace, whereby he might become worthy to receive the due reward. Not that he ventured to claim even his labour for himself; for, after saying: \"I laboured more abundantly than they all,\" he at once subjoined: \"Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\"[fn-30-P3032_1174342:120-nf] O mighty teacher, confessor, and preacher of grace!

If he could not for some reason or other consider or recollect the narrative of his holiness the bishop John, which he had heard some time before, he might surely have respected his own very recent answer at the synod, and remembered how he anathematized, but a short while before, the opinions which had been alleged against him out of Coelestius. Now among these it was objected to him that Coelestius had said: \"That the grace of God is bestowed according to our merits.\" If, then, Pelagius truthfully anathematized this, why does he say that all those graces were conferred on the apostle because he deserved them? Is the phrase \"worthy to receive\" of different meaning from the expression \"to receive according to merit\"? Can he by any disputatious subtlety show that a man is worthy who has no merit? But neither Coelestius, nor any other, all of whose opinions he anathematized, has any intention to allow him to throw clouds over the phrase, and to conceal himself behind them. He presses home the matter, and plainly says: \"And this grace has been placed in my will, according as I have been either worthy or unworthy of it.\" If, then, a statement, wherein it is declared that \"God's grace is given in proportion to our deserts, to such as are worthy,\"[fn-30-P3055_1181843:131-nf] was rightly and truly condemned by Pelagius, how could his heart permit him to think, or his mouth to utter, such a sentence as this: \"We say that God gives to the person who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces? \"[fn-30-P3056_1182104:132-nf] Who that carefully considers all this can help feeling some anxiety about his answer or defence?","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":57,"source_paragraph":"188","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"For I will not be silent as to the transactions which took place after this trial, and which rather augment the suspicion against him. A certain epistle found its way into our hands, which was ascribed to Pelagius himself, writing to a friend of his, a presbyter, who had kindly admonished him (as appears from the same epistle) not to allow any one to separate himself from the body of the Church on his account. Among the other contents of this document, which it would be both tedious and unnecessary to quote here, Pelagius says: \"By the sentence of fourteen bishops our statement was received with approbation, in which we affirmed that 'a man is able to be without sin, and easily to keep the commandments of God, if he wishes? This sentence,\" says he, \"has filled the mouths of the gainsayers with confusion, and has separated asunder the entire set which was conspiring together for evil.\" Whether, indeed, this epistle was really written by Pelagius, or was composed by somebody in his name, who can fail to see, after what manner this error claims to have achieved a victory, even in the judicial proceedings where it was refuted and condemned? Now, he has adduced the words we have just quoted according to the form in which they occur in his book of \"Chapters,\" as it is called, not in the shape in which they were objected to him at his trial, and even repeated by him in his answer. For even his accusers, through some unaccountable inaccuracy, left out a word in their indictment, concerning which there is no small controversy. They made him say, that \"a man is able to be without sin, if he wishes; and, if he wishes, to keep the commandments of God.\" There is nothing said here about this being \"easily\" done. Afterwards, when he gave his answer, he spake thus: \"We said, that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep the commandments of God, if he wishes;\" he did not then say, \"easily keep,\" but only \"keep.\" So in another place, amongst the statements about which Hilary consulted me, and I gave him my views, it was objected to Pelagius that he had said, \"A man is able, if he wishes, to live without sin.\" To this he himself responded, \"That a man is able to be without sin has been said above.\" Now, on this occasion, we do not find on the part either of those who brought the objection or of him who rebutted it, that the word \"easily\" was used at all. Then, again, in the narrative of the holy Bishop John, which we have partly quoted above,[fn-31-P3113_1207448:146-nf] he says, \"When they were importunate and exclaimed, `He is a heretic, because he says, It is true that a man is able, if he only will, to live without sin;' and then, when we questioned him on this point, he answered, `I did not say that man's nature has received the power of beingimpeccable,-but I said, whosoever is willing, in the pursuit of his own salvation, to labour and I struggle to abstain froth sinning and to walk in the commandments of God, receives the abilityto do so from God.' Then, whilst some were whispering, and remarking on the statement of Pelagius, that `without God's grace man wasable to attain perfection,' I censured the statement, and reminded them, besides, that even the Apostle Paul, after so many labours,-not, indeed, in his own strength, but by the grace of God,-said, `I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.'\"[fn-31-P3114_1208368:147-nf] And so on, as I have already mentioned.","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":55,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"190","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"What, then, is the meaning of those vaunting words of theirs in this epistle, wherein they boast of having induced the fourteen bishops who sat in that trial to believe not merely that a man has ability but that he has \"facility\" to abstain from sinning, according to the position laid down in the \"Chapters\" of this same Pelagius,-when, in the draft of the proceedings, notwithstanding the frequent repetition of the general charge and full consideration bestowed on it, this is nowhere found? How, indeed, can this word fail to contradict the very defence and answer which Pelagius made; since the Bishop John asserted that Pelagius put in this answer in his presence, that \"he wished it to be understood that the man who was willing to labour and agonize for his salvation was able to avoid sin,\" while Pelagius himself, at this time engaged in a formal inquiry anti conducting his defence,[fn-31-P3118_1209362:148-nf] said, that \"it was by his own labour and the grace of God that a man is able to be without sin?\" Now, is a thing easy when labour is required to effect it? For I suppose that every man would agree with us in the opinion, that wherever there is labour there cannot be facility. And yet a carnal epistle of windiness and inflation flies forth, and, outrunning in speed the tardy record of the proceedings, gets first into men's hands; so as to assert that fourteen bishops in the East have determined, not only \"that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep God's commandments,\" but \"easily to keep.\" Nor is God's assistance once named: it is merely said, \"If he wishes;\" so that, of course, as nothing is affirmed of the divine grace, for which the earnest fight was made, it remains that the only thing one reads of in this epistle is the unhappy and self-deceiving-because represented as victorious-human pride.

It has indeed not been defined when a man may become without sin; it has only been judicially settled, that this result can only be reached by the assisting grace of God; it has not, I say, been defined whether a man, whilst he is in this flesh which lusts against the Spirit, ever has been, or now is, or ever can be, by his present use of reason and free will, either in the full society of man or in monastic solitude, in such a state as to be beyond the necessity of offering up the prayer, not in behalf of others, but for himself personally: \"Forgive us our debts;\"[fn-31-P3120_1212412:150-nf] or whether this gift shall be consummated at the time when \"we shall be like Him, when we shall see Him as He is,\"[fn-31-P3121_1212548:151-nf] -when it shall be said, not by those that are fighting: \"I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,\"[fn-31-P3122_1212697:152-nf] but by those that are triumphing: \"O death, where is thy victory?

Dost thou see what strictness of virtue he demands from the bishop? For as some most excellent painter from life, having mixed many colors, if he be about to furnish an original likeness of the royal form, works with all accuracy, so that all who are copying it, and painting from it, may have a likeness accurately drawn, so accordingly the blessed Paul, as though painting some royal likeness, and furnishing an original sketch of it, having mixed the different colors of virtue, has painted in the features of the office of bishop complete, in order that each of those who mount to that dignity, looking thereupon, may administer their own affairs with just such strictness.","title":"Eulogy.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"116","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"51.

For, being placed midway between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of the Fruit of which he tasted,[fn-49-P4997_1507688:20-nf] he was changed into the nature of the latter, himself being neither the tree of life nor that of corruption; but having been shown forth as mortal, from his participation in and presence with corruption, and, again, as incorrupt and immortal by connection with and participation in life; as Paul also taught, saying, \"Corruption shall not inherit incorruption, nor death life,\"[fn-49-P4998_1508083:21-nf] rightly defining corruption and death to be that which corrupts and kills, and not that which is corrupted and dies; and incorruption and life that which gives life and immortality, and not that which receives life and immortality. And thus man is neither a discord and an inequality, nor an equality and a harmony. But when he received discord, which is transgression and sin, he became discordant and unseemly; but when he received harmony, that is righteousness, he became a harmonious and seemly organ, in order that the Lord, the Incorruption which conquered death, might harmonize the resurrection with the flesh, not suffering it again to be inherited by corruption. And on this point also let these statements suffice.","title":"Discourse III.-Thaleia.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":15,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But I perceive that while the necessities of the subject compelled me to follow this line of thought, I have lingered too long over this passage[fn-16-P1663_958949:1-nf] . I must now resume the train of his complaints, that we may pass by none of the charges brought against us without an answer. And first I propose that we should examine this point, that he charges us with asserting that an ordinary man has wrought the salvation of the world. For although this point has been to some extent already cleared up by the investigations we have made, we shall yet briefly deal with it once more, that the mind of those who are acting as our judges on this slanderous accusation may be entirely freed from misapprehension. So far are we from referring to an ordinary man the cause of this great and unspeakable grace, that even if any should refer so great a boon to Peter and Paul, or to an angel from heaven, we should say with Paul, \"let him be anathema[fn-16-P1664_959817:2-nf] .\" For Paul was not crucified for us, nor were we baptized into a human name[fn-16-P1665_959923:3-nf] . Surely the doctrine which our adversaries oppose to the truth is not thereby strengthened when we confess that the saving power of Christ is more potent than human nature[fn-16-P1666_960112:4-nf] :-yet it may seem to be so, for their aim is to maintain at all points the difference of the essence of the Son from that of the Father, and they strive to show the dissimilarity of essence not only by the contrast of the Generated with the Ungenerate, but also by the opposition of the passible to the impassible. And while this is more openly maintained in the last part of their argument, it is also clearly shown in their present discourse[fn-16-P1667_961029:5-nf] . For if he finds fault with those who refer the Passion to the Human Nature, his intention is certainly to subject to the Passion the Godhead Itself. For our conception being twofold, and admitting of two developments, accordingly as the Divinity or the Humanity is held to have been in a condition of suffering, an attack on one of these views is clearly a maintaining of the other. Accordingly, if they find fault with those who look upon the Passion as concerning the Man, they will clearly approve those who say that the Godhead of the Son was subject to passion, and the position which these last maintain becomes an argument in favour of their own absurd doctrine. For if, according to their statement, the Godhead of the Son suffers, while that of the Father is preserved in absolute impassibility, then the impassible Nature is essentially different from that which admits passion. Seeing, therefore, that the dictum before us, though, so far as it is limited by number of words, it is a short one, yet affords principles and hypotheses for every kind ofdoctrinal pravity, it would seem right that ourreaders should require in our reply not so much brevity as soundness. We, then, neither attribute our own salvation to a man, nor admit that the incorruptible and Divine Nature is capable of suffering and mortality: but since we must assuredly believe the Divine utterances which declare to us that the Word that was in the beginning was God[fn-16-P1668_962564:6-nf] , and that afterward the Word made flesh was seen upon the earth and conversed with men[fn-16-P1669_962673:7-nf] , we admit in our creed those conceptions which are consonant with the Divine utterance. For when we hear that He is Light, and Power, and Righteousness, and Life, and Truth, and that by Him all things were made, we account all these and such-like statements as things to be believed, referring them to God the Word: but when we hear of pain, of slumber, of need, of trouble, of bonds, of nails, of the spear, of blood, of wounds, of burial, of the sepulchre, and all else of this kind, even if they are somewhat opposed to what has previously been stated, we none the less admit them to be things to be believed, and true, having regard to the flesh; which we receive by faith as conjoined with the Word. For as it is not possible to contemplate the peculiar attributes of the flesh as existing in the Word that was in the beginning, so also on the other hand we may not conceive those which are proper to the Godhead as existing in the nature of the flesh. As, therefore, the teaching of the Gospel concerning our Lord is mingled, partly of lofty and Divine ideas, partly of those which are lowly and human, we assign every particular phrase accordingly to one or other of these Natures which we conceive in the mystery, that which is human to the Humanity, that which is lofty to the Godhead, and say that, as God, the Son is certainly impassible and incapable of corruption: and whatever suffering is asserted concerning Him in the Gospel, He assuredly wrought by means of His Human Nature which admitted of such suffering. For verily the Godhead works the salvation of the world by means of that body which encompassed It, in such wise that the suffering was of the body, but the operation was of God; and even if some wrest to the support of the opposite doctrine the words of the Apostle, \"God spared not His own Sons,[fn-16-P1670_964521:8-nf] ,\" and, \"God sent His own Son[fn-16-P1671_964569:9-nf] ,\" and other similar phrases which seem to refer, in the matter of the Passion, to the Divine Nature, and not to the Humanity, we shall none the less refuse to abandon sound doctrine, seeing that Paul himself declares to us more clearly the mystery of this subject. For he everywhere attributes to the Human element in Christ the dispensation of the Passion, when he says, \"for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-16-P1672_965040:10-nf] ,\" and, \"God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh[fn-16-P1673_965154:11-nf] \" (for he says, \"in the flesh,\" not \"in the Godhead\"); and \"He was crucified through weakness\" (where by \"weakness\" he means \"the flesh\"), \"yet liveth by power[fn-16-P1674_965337:12-nf] \" (while he indicates by \"power\" the Divine Nature); and, \"He died unto sin\" (that is, with regard to the body), \"but liveth unto God[fn-16-P1675_965492:13-nf] \" (that is, with regard to the Godhead, so that by these words it is established that, while the Man tasted death, the immortal Nature did not admit the suffering of death); and again; \"He made Him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin[fn-16-P1676_965742:14-nf] ,\" giving once more the name of \"sin\" to the flesh.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":15,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_112_second_latin_form_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-08","text":"4.

In his regard for the perplexities and scruples of the weak and sensitive believer, he adds these solemn concluding words, according to the Scriptures, to his proclamation of the death and the resurrection. He would not have us grow weaker, driven about by every wind of vain doctrine, or vexed by empty subtleties and false doubts: he would summon faith to return, before it were shipwrecked, to the haven of piety, believing and confessing the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, Son of Man and Son of God, according to the Scriptures, this being the safeguard of reverence against the attack of the adversary, so to understand the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as it was written of Him. There is no danger in faith: the reverent confession of the hidden mystery of God is always safe. Christ was born of the Virgin, but conceived of the Holy Ghost according to the Scriptures. Christ wept, but according to the Scriptures: that which made Him weep was also a cause of joy. Christ hungered; but according to the Scriptures, He used His power as God against the tree which bore no fruit, when He had no loath Christ suffered: but according to the Scriptures, He was about to sit at the right hand of Power. He complained that He was abandoned to die: but according to the Scriptures, at the same moment He received in His kingdom in Paradise the thief who confessed Him.

If this, however, were true, in vain would the apostle say: \"By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\"[fn-36-P3666_1402584:59-nf] For inasmuch as those ancient saints, according to the vain conceits of these men, found their nature self-sufficient, and required not the man Christ to be their Mediator to reconcile them to God, so neither shall they be made alive in Him, to whose body they are shown not to belong as members, according to the statement that it was on man's account that He became man. If, however, as the Truth says through His apostles, even as all die in Adam, even so shall all be made alive in Christ; forasmuch as the resurrection of the dead comes through the one man, even as death comes through the other man; what Christian man can be bold enough to doubt that even those righteous men who pleased God in the more remote periods of the human race are destined to attain to the resurrection of eternal life, and not eternal death, because they shall be made alive in Christ? that they are made alive in Christ, because they belong to the body of Christ? that they belong to the body of Christ, because Christ is the head even to them?[fn-36-P3667_1403639:60-nf] and that Christ is the head even to them, because there is but one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus?

As regards the passage from Paul's epistle which teaches, in opposition to your heresy, that the Son of God was born of the seed of David, it is found in all manuscripts both new and old of all Churches, and in all languages. So the profession which Faustus makes of believing the apostle is hypocritical. Instead of saying, \"Assuredly I believe,\" he should have said, Assuredly I do not believe, as he would have said if he had not wished to deceive people. What part of his belief does he get from the apostle? Not the first man, of whom the apostle says that he is of the earth, earthy; and again, \"The first man Adam was made a living soul.\" Faustus' First Man is neither of the earth, earthy, nor made a living soul, but of the substance of God, and the same in essence as God; and this being is said to have mixed up with the race of darkness his members, or vesture, or weapons, that is, the five elements, which also are part of the substance of God, so that they became subject to confinement and pollution. Nor does Faustus get from Paul his Second Man, of whom Paul says that He is from heaven, and that He is the last Adam, and a quickening spirit; and also that He was born of the seed of David after the flesh, that He was made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law.[fn-13-P1343_712133:5-nf] Of Him Paul says to Timothy: \"Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead, according to my gospel.\"[fn-13-P1344_712282:6-nf] And this resurrection he quotes as an example of our resurrection: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures.\" And a little further on he draws an inference from this doctrine: \"Now, if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?\"[fn-13-P1345_712774:7-nf] Our professed believer in Paul believes nothing of all this. He denies that Jesus was born of the seed of David, that He was made of a woman (by the word woman is not meant a wife in the common sense of the word, but merely one of the female sex, as in the book of Genesis, where it is said that God made a woman before she was brought to Adam[fn-13-P1346_713142:8-nf] ); he denies His death, His burial, and His resurrection. He holds that Christ had not a mortal body, and therefore could not really die; and that the marks of His wounds which He showed to His disciples when He appeared to them alive after His resurrection, which Paul also mentions,[fn-13-P1347_713443:9-nf] were not real. He denies, too, that our mortal body will be raised again, changed into a spiritual body; as Paul teaches: \"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\" To illustrate this distinction between the natural and the spiritual body, the apostle adds what I have quoted already about the first and the last Adam. Then he goes on: \"But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\" And to explain what he means by flesh and blood, that it is not the bodily substance, but corruption, which will not enter into the resurrection of the just, he immediately says, \"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" And in case any one should still suppose that it is not what is buried that is to rise again, but that it is as if one garment were laid aside and a better taken instead, he proceeds to show distinctly that the same body will be changed for the better, as the garments of Christ on the mount were not displaced, but transfigured: \"Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all be changed, but we shall all rise.\"[fn-13-P1348_714540:10-nf] Then he shows who are to be changed: \"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\" And if it should be said that it is not as regards our mortal and corruptible body, but as regards our soul, that we are to be changed, it should be observed that the apostle is not speaking of the soul, but of the body, as is evident from the question he starts with: \"But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?\" So also, in the conclusion of his argument, he leaves no doubt of what he is speaking: \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-13-P1349_715270:11-nf] Faustus denies this; and the God whom Paul declares to be \"immortal, incorruptible, to whom alone is glory and honor,\"[fn-13-P1350_715412:12-nf] he makes corruptible. For in this monstrous and horrible fiction of theirs, the substance and nature of God was in danger of being wholly corrupted by the race of darkness, and to save the rest part actually was corrupted.

As regards the passage from Paul's epistle which teaches, in opposition to your heresy, that the Son of God was born of the seed of David, it is found in all manuscripts both new and old of all Churches, and in all languages. So the profession which Faustus makes of believing the apostle is hypocritical. Instead of saying, \"Assuredly I believe,\" he should have said, Assuredly I do not believe, as he would have said if he had not wished to deceive people. What part of his belief does he get from the apostle? Not the first man, of whom the apostle says that he is of the earth, earthy; and again, \"The first man Adam was made a living soul.\" Faustus' First Man is neither of the earth, earthy, nor made a living soul, but of the substance of God, and the same in essence as God; and this being is said to have mixed up with the race of darkness his members, or vesture, or weapons, that is, the five elements, which also are part of the substance of God, so that they became subject to confinement and pollution. Nor does Faustus get from Paul his Second Man, of whom Paul says that He is from heaven, and that He is the last Adam, and a quickening spirit; and also that He was born of the seed of David after the flesh, that He was made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law.[fn-13-P1343_712133:5-nf] Of Him Paul says to Timothy: \"Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead, according to my gospel.\"[fn-13-P1344_712282:6-nf] And this resurrection he quotes as an example of our resurrection: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures.\" And a little further on he draws an inference from this doctrine: \"Now, if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?\"[fn-13-P1345_712774:7-nf] Our professed believer in Paul believes nothing of all this. He denies that Jesus was born of the seed of David, that He was made of a woman (by the word woman is not meant a wife in the common sense of the word, but merely one of the female sex, as in the book of Genesis, where it is said that God made a woman before she was brought to Adam[fn-13-P1346_713142:8-nf] ); he denies His death, His burial, and His resurrection. He holds that Christ had not a mortal body, and therefore could not really die; and that the marks of His wounds which He showed to His disciples when He appeared to them alive after His resurrection, which Paul also mentions,[fn-13-P1347_713443:9-nf] were not real. He denies, too, that our mortal body will be raised again, changed into a spiritual body; as Paul teaches: \"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\" To illustrate this distinction between the natural and the spiritual body, the apostle adds what I have quoted already about the first and the last Adam.

That the Son of God was made man of the seed of David, is not only said in other places by Paul, but is taught elsewhere in sacred Scripture. As regards the words, \"Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more,\" the context shows what is the apostle's meaning. Here, or elsewhere, he views with an assured hope, as if it were already present and in actual possession, our future life, which is now fulfilled in our risen Head and Mediator, the man Christ Jesus. This life will certainly not be after the flesh, even as Christ's life is now not after the flesh. For by flesh the apostle here means not the substance of our bodies, in which sense the Lord used the word when, after His resurrection, He said, \"Handle me, and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have,\"[fn-13-P1359_721768:17-nf] but the corruption and mortality of flesh, which will then not be in us, as now it is not in Christ. The apostle uses the word flesh in the sense of corruption in the passage about the resurrection quoted before: \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" So, after the event described in the next verse, \"Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall all rise, but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump (for the trumpet shall sound); and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,\"[fn-13-P1360_722481:18-nf] -then flesh, in the sense of the substance of the body, will, after this change, no longer have flesh, in the sense of the corruption of mortality; and yet, as regards its own nature, it will be the same flesh, the same which rises and which is changed. What the Lord said after His resurrection is true, \"Handle me, and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have;\" and what the apostle says is true, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\" The first is said of the bodily substance, which exists as the subject of the change: the second is said of the corruption of the flesh, which will cease to exist, for, after its change, flesh will not be corrupted. So, \"we have known Christ after the flesh,\" that is, after the mortality of flesh, before His resurrection; \"now henceforth we know Him no more,\" because, as the same apostle says, \"Christ being risen from the dead, dieth no more, and death hath no more dominion over Him.\"[fn-13-P1361_723466:19-nf] The words, \"we have known Christ after the fleshy\" strictly speaking, imply that Christ was after the flesh, for what never was cannot be known. And it is not \"we have supposed,\" but \"we have known.\" But not to insist on a word, in case some one should say that known is used in the sense of supposed, it is astonishing, if one could be surprised at want of sight in a blind man, that these blind people do not perceive that if what the apostle says about not knowing Christ after the flesh proves that Christ had not flesh, then what he says in the same place of not knowing any one henceforth after the flesh proves that all those here referred to had not flesh. For when he speaks of not knowing any one, he cannot intend to speak only of Christ; but in his realization of the future life with those who are to be changed at the resurrection, he says, \"Henceforth we know no man after the flesh;\" that is, we have such an assured hope of our future incorruption and immortality, that the thought of it makes us rejoice even now. So he says elsewhere: \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affections upon things above, and not on things on the earth.\"[fn-13-P1362_724724:20-nf] It is true we have not yet risen as Christ has, but we are said to have risen with Him on account of the hope which we have in Him. So again he says: \"According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration.\"[fn-13-P1363_724965:21-nf] Evidently what we obtain in the washing of regeneration is not the salvation itself, but the hope of it. And yet, because this hope is certain, we are said to be saved, as if the salvation were already bestowed. Elsewhere it is said explicitly: \"We groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope. But hope which is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for what we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-13-P1364_725500:22-nf] The apostle says not, \"we are to be saved,\" but, \"We are now saved,\" that is, in hope, though not yet in reality. And in the same way it is in hope, though not yet in reality, that we now know no man after the flesh. This hope is in Christ, in whom what we hope for as promised to us has already been fulfilled. He is risen, and death has no more dominion over Him. Though we have known Him after the flesh, before His death, when there was in His body that mortality which the apostle properly calls flesh, now henceforth know we Him no more; for that mortal of His has now put on immortality, and His flesh, in the sense of mortality, no longer exists.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_28_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_tarsians","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And that He Himself is not God over all, and the Father, but His Son, He [shows when He] says, \"I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.\"[fn-26-P2645_435445:18-nf] And again, \"When all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall He also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.\"[fn-26-P2646_435625:19-nf] Wherefore it is one [Person] who put all things under, and who is all in all, and another [Person] to whom they were subdued, who also Himself, along with all other things, becomes subject [to the former].","title":"The Epistle of Ignatius to the Tarsians","author":"Ignatius"},{"chapter":15,"verse":53,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_28_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_tarsians","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And that our bodies are to rise again, He shows when He says, \"Verily I say unto you, that the hour cometh, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.\"[fn-26-P2663_437574:30-nf] And [says] the apostle, \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-26-P2664_437709:31-nf] And that we must live soberly and righteously, he [shows when he] says again, \"Be not deceived: neither adulterers, nor effeminate persons, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor fornicators, nor revilers, nor drunkards, nor thieves, can inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-26-P2665_438001:32-nf] And again, \"If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised; our preaching therefore is vain, and your faith is also vain: ye are yet in your sins.

But when this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in strife. O death, where is thy sting? O death, where is thy strife[fn-22-P2258_1440636:62-nf] ? In the subjection of His enemies death is Conquered; and, death conquered, life immortal follows. The Apostle tells us also of the special reward attained by this subjection which is made perfect by the subjection of belief: Who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of His glory, according to the works of His power, whereby He is able to subject all things to Himself[fn-22-P2259_1441195:63-nf] . There is then another subjection, which consists in a transition from one nature to another, for our nature ceases, so far as its present character is concerned, and is subjected to Him, into Whose form it passes.

It is thus that God shall be all in all: according to the Dispensation He becomes by His Godhead and His manhood the Mediator between men and God, and so by the Dispensation He acquires the nature of flesh, and by the subjection shall obtain the nature of God in all things, so as to be God not in part, but wholly and entirely.

That it is indeed imperfect has been already sufficiently shown, since it is found to be neither natural nor rational. The same conclusion, however, shall now be made clear[fn-41-P4180_1362357:301-nf] by another method; it is not simply[fn-41-P4181_1362412:302-nf] imperfect, but actually[fn-41-P4182_1362452:303-nf] feeble, weak, and exhausted, failing to embrace the full number[fn-41-P4183_1362529:304-nf] of its material objects, and not manifesting itself in them all. For all are not put into a state of salvation[fn-41-P4184_1362661:305-nf] by it; but the Creator's subjects, both Jew and Christian, are all excepted.[fn-41-P4185_1362778:306-nf] Now, when the greater part thus perish, how can that goodness be defended as a perfect one which is inoperative in most cases, is somewhat only in few, naught in many, succumbs to perdition, and is a partner with destruction?[fn-41-P4186_1363022:307-nf] And if so many shall miss salvation, it will not be with goodness, but with malignity, that the greater perfection will lie. For as it is the operation of goodness which brings salvation, so is it malevolence which thwarts it.[fn-41-P4187_1363274:308-nf] Since, however, this goodness) saves but few, and so rather leans to the alternative of not saving, it will show itself to greater perfection by not interposing help than by helping. Now, you will not be able to attribute goodness (to your god) in reference to the Creator, (if accompanied with) failure towards all. For whomsoever you call in to judge the question, it is as a dispenser of goodness, if so be such a title can be made out,[fn-41-P4188_1363739:309-nf] and not as a squanderer thereof, as you claim your god to be, that you must submit the divine character for determination. So long, then, as you prefer your god to the Creator on the simple ground of his goodness, and since he professes to have this attribute as solely and wholly his own, he ought not to have been wanting in it to any one. However, I do not now wish to prove that Marcion's god is imperfect in goodness because of the perdition of the greater number. I am content to illustrate this imperfection by the fact that even those whom he saves are found to possess but an imperfect salvation-that is, they are saved only so far as the soul is concerned,[fn-41-P4189_1364511:310-nf] but lost in their body, which, according to him, does not rise again. Now, whence comes this halving of salvation, if not from a failure of goodness? What could have been a better proof of a perfect goodness, than the recovery of the whole man to salvation? Totally damned by the Creator, he should have been totally restored by the most merciful god. I rather think that by Marcion's rule the body is baptized, is deprived of marriage,[fn-41-P4190_1365172:311-nf] is cruelly tortured in confession. But although sins are attributed to the body, yet they are preceded by the guilty concupiscence of the soul; nay, the first motion of sin must be ascribed to the soul, to which the flesh acts in the capacity of a servant. By and by, when freed from the soul, the flesh sins no more.[fn-41-P4191_1365607:312-nf] So that in this matter goodness is unjust, and likewise imperfect, in that it leaves to destruction the more harmless substance, which sins rather by compliance than in will. Now, although Christ put not on the verity of the flesh, as your heresy is pleased to assume, He still vouchsafed to take upon Him the semblance thereof. Surely, therefore, some regard was due to it from Him, because of this His reigned assumption of it. Besides, what else is man than flesh, since no doubt it was the corporeal rather than the spiritual[fn-41-P4192_1366170:313-nf] element from which the Author of man's nature gave him his designation?[fn-41-P4193_1366344:314-nf] \"And the Lord God made man of the dust of the ground,\" not of spiritual essence; this afterwards came from the divine afflatus: \"and man became a living soul.\" What, then, is man? Made, no doubt of it, of the dust; and God placed him in paradise, because He moulded him, not breathed him, into being-a fabric of flesh, not of spirit. Now, this being the case, with what face will you contend for the perfect character of that goodness which did not fail in some one particular only of man's deliverance, but in its general capacity? If that is a plenary grace and a substantial mercy which brings salvation to the soul alone, this were the better life which we now enjoy whole and entire; whereas to rise again but in part will be a chastisement, not a liberation. The proof of the perfect goodness is, that man, after his rescue, should be delivered from the domicile and power of the malignant deity unto the protection of the most good and merciful God. Poor dupe of Marcion, fever[fn-41-P4194_1367416:315-nf] is hard upon you; and your painful flesh produces a crop of all sorts of briers and thorns. Nor is it only to the Creator's thunderbolts that you lie exposed, or to wars, and pestilences, and His other heavier strokes, but even to His creeping insects. In what respect do you suppose yourself liberated from His kingdom when His flies are still creeping upon your face? If your deliverance lies in the future, why not also in the present, that it may be perfectly wrought? Far different is our condition in the sight of Him who is the Author, the Judge, the injured[fn-41-P4195_1368001:316-nf] Head of our race!

If, then, we believe that the saints who shall be found alive at Christ's coming, and shall be caught up to meet Him, shall in that same ascent pass from mortal to immortal bodies, we shall find no difficulty in the words of the apostle, either when he says, \"That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die,\" or when he says, \"We Shall all rise,\" or \"all sleep,\" for not even the saints shall be quickened to immortality unless they first die, however briefly; and consequently they shall not be exempt from resurrection which is preceded by sleep, however brief. And why should it seem to us incredible that that multitude of bodies should be, as it were, sown in the air, and should in the air forthwith revive immortal and incorruptible, when we believe, on the testimony of the same apostle, that the resurrection shall take place in the twinkling of an eye, and that the dust of bodies long dead shall return with incomprehensible facility and swiftness to those members that are now to live endlessly? Neither do we suppose that in the case of these saints the sentence, \"Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,\" is null, though their bodies do not, on dying, fall to earth, but both die and rise again at once while caught up into the air. For \"Thou shalt return to earth\" means, Thou shalt at death return to that which thou weft before life began. Thou shalt, when examinate, be that which thou weft before thou wast animate. For it was into a face of earth that God breathed the breath of life when man was made a living soul; as if it were said, Thou art earth with a soul, which thou wast not; thou shalt be earth without a soul, as thou wast. And this is what all bodies of the dead are before they rot; and what the bodies of those saints shall be if they die, no matter where they die, as soon as they shall give up that life which they are immediately to receive back again. In this way, then, they return or go to earth, inasmuch as from being living men they shall be earth, as that which becomes cinder is said to go to cinder; that which decays, to go to decay; and so of six hundred other things.

For if the prophets were able to know things that had not yet happened, by means of that indwelling of God in their minds, limited though it was, shall not the immortal saints know things that have already happened, when God shall be all in all?[fn-39-P3977_2186009:120-nf] The seed, then, and the name of the saints shall remain in that blessedness,-the seed, to wit, of which John says, \"And his seed remaineth in him;\"[fn-39-P3978_2186179:121-nf] and the name, of which it was said through Isaiah himself, \"I will give them an everlasting name.\"[fn-39-P3979_2186300:122-nf] \"And there shall be to them month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath,\" as if it were said, Moon after moon, and rest upon rest, both of which they shall themselves be when they shall pass from the old shadows of time into the new lights of eternity. The worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched, which constitute the punishment of the wicked, are differently interpreted by different people. For some refer both to the body, others refer both to the soul; while others again refer the fire literally to the body, and the worm figuratively to the soul, which seems the more credible idea. But the present is not the time to discuss this difference, for we have undertaken to occupy this book with the last judgment, in which the good and the bad are separated: their rewards and punishments we shall more carefully discuss elsewhere.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"28.

For why did they preach Christ, in Whom, according to Eunomius, there does not reside the power of eternal life? Why do they make mention of those who had believed in Christ, unless it was through Him that they were to be partakers of eternal life? \"For the intelligence,\" he says, \"of those who have believed in the Lord, overleaping all sensible and intellectual existence, cannot stop even at the generation of the Son, but speeds beyond even this in its yearning for eternal life, eager to meet the First.\" What ought I most to bewail in this passage? that the wretched men do not think that eternal life is in the Son, or that they conceive of the Person of the Only-begotten in so grovelling and earthly a fashion, that they fancy they can mount in their reasonings upon His beginning, and so look by the power of their own intellect beyond the life of the Son, and, leaving the generation of the Lord somewhere beneath them, can speed onward beyond this in their yearning for eternal life? For the meaning of what I have quoted is nothing else than this, that the human mind, scrutinizing the knowledge of real existence, and lifting itself above the sensible and intelligible creation, will leave God the Word, Who was in the beginning, below itself, just as it has left below it all other things, and itself comes to be in Him in Whom God the Word was not, treading, by mental activity, regions which lie beyond the life of the Son, there searching for eternal life, where the Only-begotten God is not. \"For in its yearning for eternal life,\" he says, \"it is borne in thought, beyond the Son\"-clearly as though it had not in the Son found that which it was seeking.If the eternal life is not in the Son, then assuredly He Who said, \"I am the life[fn-19-P1958_1173966:14-nf] ,\" will be convicted of falsehood, or else He is life, it is true. but not eternal life.

Why, either that irrational animals are rational, or that the Reason must be confessed to be irrational. Have we any further need of words to confute their accursed and malignant blasphemy? Do such statements even pretend to conceal their intention of denying the Lord? For if the Apostle plainly says that what is not eternal is temporary[fn-19-P1961_1175158:17-nf] , and if these people see eternal life in the essence of the Father alone, and if by alienating the Son from the Nature of the Father they also cut Him off from eternal life, what is this but a manifest denial and rejection of the faith in the Lord? while the Apostle clearly says that those who \"in this life only have hope in Christ are of all men most miserable[fn-19-P1962_1175571:18-nf] .\" If then the Lord is life, but not eternal life, assuredly the life is temporal, and but for a day, that which is operative only for the present time, or else[fn-19-P1963_1175756:19-nf] the Apostle bemoans those who have hope, as having missed the true life.","title":"Book X","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":15,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_27_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"13.

And, indeed, on this subject of the Father and the Son, learned and spiritual[fn-32-P3259_1501126:77-nf] men have conducted discussions in many books, in which, so far as men could do with men, they have endeavored to introduce an intelligible account as to how the Father was not one personally with the Son, and yet the two were one substantially;[fn-32-P3260_1501447:78-nf] and as to what the Father was individually (proprie), and what the Son: to wit, that the former was the Begetter, the latter the Begotten; the formernot of the Son, the latter of the Father: theformer the Beginning of the latter, whence also He is called the Head of Christ,[fn-32-P3261_1501854:79-nf] although Christ likewise is the Beginning,[fn-32-P3262_1501917:80-nf] but not of the Father; the latter, moreover, the Image[fn-32-P3263_1502149:81-nf] of the former, although in no respect dissimilar, and although absolutely and without difference equal (omnino et indifferenter aequalis). These questions are handled with greater breadth by those who, in less narrow limits than ours are at present, seek to set forth the profession of the Christian faith in its totality. Accordingly, in so far as He is the Son, of the Father received He it that He is, while that other [the Father] received not this of the Son; and in so far as He, in unutterable mercy, in a temporal dispensation took upon Himself the [nature of] man (hominem),-to wit, the changeable creature that was thereby to be changed into something better,-many statements concerning Him are discovered in the Scriptures, which are so expressed as to have given occasion to error in the impious intellects of heretics, with whom the desire to teach takes precedence of that to understand, so that they have supposed Him to be neither equal with the Father nor of the same substance. Such statements [are meant] as the following: \"For the Father is greater than I;\"[fn-32-P3264_1503245:82-nf] and, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God;\"[fn-32-P3265_1503368:83-nf] and, \"Then shall He Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him;\"[fn-32-P3266_1503467:84-nf] and, \"I go to my Father and your Father, my God and your God,\"[fn-32-P3267_1503550:85-nf] together with some others of like tenor. Now all these have had a place given them, [certainly] not with the object of signifying an inequality of nature and substance; for to take them so would be to falsify a different class of statements, such as, \"I and my Father are one\" (unum);[fn-32-P3268_1503853:86-nf] and, \"He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also;\"[fn-32-P3269_1503923:87-nf] and, \"The Word was God,\"[fn-32-P3270_1503966:88-nf] for He was not made, inasmuch as \"all things were made by Him;\"[fn-32-P3271_1504046:89-nf] and, \"He thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\"[fn-32-P3272_1504117:90-nf] together with all the other passages of a similar order. But these statements have had a place given them, partly with a view to that administration of His assumption of human nature (administrationem suscepti hominis), in accordance with which it is said that \"He emptied Himself:\" not that that Wisdom was changed, since it is absolutely unchangeable; but that it was His will to make Himself known in such humble fashion to men. Partly then, I repeat, it is with a view to this administration that those things have been thus written which the heretics make the ground of their false allegations; and partly it was with a view to the consideration that the Son owes to the Father that which He is,[fn-32-P3273_1504849:91-nf] -thereby also certainly owing this in particular to the Father, to wit, that He is equal to the same Father, or that He is His Peer (eidem Patri aequalis aut par est), whereas the Father owes whatsoever He is to no one.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":52,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_27_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"23.

For a certain part thereof resists[fn-33-P3311_1517544:121-nf] the Spirit, not in virtue of nature, but in virtue of the custom of sins; whence it is said, \"With the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And this custom has been turned into a nature, according to mortal generation, by the sin of the first man. Consequently it is also written in this wise, \"And we were sometime by nature the children of wrath,\"[fn-33-P3312_1518089:122-nf] that is, of vengeance, through which it has come to pass that we serve the law of sin.

But inasmuch as this same soul is also made pure, and receives the stability of its own nature, under the dominance of the spirit, which is the head for it, which head of the said soul has again its own head in Christ, we ought not to despair of the restoration of the body also to its own proper nature. But this certainly will not be effected so speedily as is the case with the soul; just as the soul too, is not restored so speedily as the spirit. Yet it will take place in the appropriate season, at the last trump, when \"the dead shall rise uncorrupted, and we shall be changed.\"[fn-33-P3315_1519321:125-nf] And accordingly we believe also in The Resurrection of the Flesh, to wit, not merely that that soul, which at present by reason of carnal affections is called the flesh, is restored; but that it shall be so likewise with this visible flesh, which is the flesh according to nature, the name of which has been received by the soul, not in virtue of nature, but in reference to carnal affections: this visible flesh, then, I say, which is the flesh properly so called, must without doubt be believed to be destined to rise again.

Rise again, therefore, the body will, according to the Christian faith, which is incapable of deceiving. And if this appears incredible to any one, [it is because] he looks simply to what the flesh is at present, while he fails to consider of what nature it shall be hereafter. For at that time of angelic change it will no more be flesh and blood, but onlybody.[fn-33-P3319_1521279:128-nf] For when the apostle speaks of the flesh, he says, \"There is one flesh of cattle, another of birds, another of fishes, another of creeping things: there are also both celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies.\"[fn-33-P3320_1521611:129-nf] Now what he has said here is not \"celestial flesh,\" but \"both celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies.\" For all flesh is also body; but every body is not also flesh. In the first instance, [for example, this holds good] in the case of those terrestrial bodies, inasmuch as wood is body, but not flesh. In the case of man, again, or in that of cattle, we have both body and flesh. In the case of celestial bodies, on the other hand, there is no flesh, but only those simple and lucent bodies which the apostle designates spiritual, while some call them ethereal. And consequently, when he says, \"Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-33-P3321_1522287:130-nf] that does not contradict the resurrection of the flesh; but the sentence predicates what will be the nature of that hereafter which at present is flesh and blood. And if any one refuses to believe that the flesh is capable of being changed into the sort of nature thus indicated, he must be led on, step by step, to this faith. For if you require of him whether earth is capable of being changed into water, the nearness of the thing will make it not seem incredible to him. Again, if you inquire whether water is capable of being changed into air, he replies that this also is not absurd, for the elements are near each other. And if, on the subject of the air, it is asked whether that can be changed into an ethereal, that is, a celestial body, the simple fact of the nearness at once convinces him of the possibility of the thing. But if, then, he concedes that through such gradations it is quite a possible thing that earth should be changed into an ethereal body, why does he refuse to believe, when that will of God, too, enters in addition, whereby a human body had power to walk upon the waters, that the same change is capable of being effected with the utmost rapidity, precisely in accordance with the saying, \"in the twinkling of an eye,\"[fn-33-P3322_1523562:131-nf] and without any such gradations, even as, according to common wont, smoke is changed into flame with marvellous quickness?

Except, indeed, that this opinion of his will be sure to have others to maintain it in his precocious and somewhat abortive Marcionites, whom the Apostle John designated as antichrists, when they denied that Christ was come in the flesh; not that they did this with the view of establishing the right of the other god (for on this point also they had been branded by the same apostle), but because they had started with assuming the incredibility of an incarnate God. Now, the more firmly the antichrist Marcion had seized this assumption, the more prepared was he, of course, to reject the bodily substance of Christ, since he had introduced his very god to our notice as neither the author nor the restorer of the flesh; and for this very reason, to be sure, as pre-eminently good, and most remote from the deceits and fallacies of the Creator. His Christ, therefore, in order to avoid all such deceits and fallacies, and the imputation, if possible, of belonging to the Creator, was not what he appeared to be, and reigned himself to be what he was not-incarnate without being flesh, human without being man, and likewise a divine Christ without being God! But why should he not have propagated also the phantom of God? Can I believe him on the subject of the internal nature, who was all wrong touching the external substance? How will it be possible to believe him true on a mystery, when he has been found so false on a plain fact? How, moreover, when he confounds the truth of the spirit with the error of the flesh,[fn-49-P4907_1551618:118-nf] could he combine within himself that communion of light and darkness, or truth and error, which the apostle says cannot co-exist?[fn-49-P4908_1551802:119-nf] Since however, Christ's being flesh is now discovered to be a lie, it follows that all things which were done by the flesh of Christ were done untruly,[fn-49-P4909_1551976:120-nf] -every act of intercourse,[fn-49-P4910_1552020:121-nf] of contact, of eating or drinking,[fn-49-P4911_1552074:122-nf] yea, His very miracles. If with a touch, or by being touched, He freed any one of a disease, whatever was done by any corporeal act cannot be believed to have been truly done in the absence of all reality in His body itself. Nothing substantial can be allowed to have been effected by an unsubstantial thing; nothing full by a vacuity. If the habit were putative, the action was putative; if the worker were imaginary the works were imaginary. On this principle, too, the sufferings of Christ will be found not to warrant faith in Him. For He suffered nothing who did not truly suffer; and a phantom could not truly suffer. God's entire work, therefore, is subverted. Christ's death, wherein lies the whole weight and fruit of the Christian name, is denied although the apostle asserts[fn-49-P4912_1552878:123-nf] it so expressly[fn-49-P4913_1552911:124-nf] as undoubtedly real, making it the very foundation of the gospel, of our salvation and of his own preaching.[fn-49-P4914_1553056:125-nf] \"I have delivered unto you before all things,\" says he, \"how that Christ died for our sins, and that he was buried, and that He rose again the third day.\" Besides, if His flesh is denied, how is His death to be asserted; for death is the proper suffering of the flesh, which returns through death back to the earth out of which it was taken, according to the law of its Maker? Now, if His death be denied, because of the denial of His flesh, there will be no certainty of His resurrection. For He rose not, for the very same reason that He died not, even because He possessed not the reality of the flesh, to which as death accrues, so does resurrection likewise. Similarly, if Christ's resurrection be nullified, ours also is destroyed. If Christ's resurrection be not realized,[fn-49-P4915_1553871:126-nf] neither shall that be for which Christ came. For just as they, who said that there is no resurrection of the dead, are refuted by the apostle from the resurrection of Christ, so, if the resurrection of Christ falls to the ground, the resurrection of the dead is also swept away.[fn-49-P4916_1554166:127-nf] And so our faith is vain, and vain also is the preaching of the apostles. Moreover, they even show themselves to be false witnesses of God, because they testified that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise.

For they deny that God created those things which the apostle plainly declares to be the creatures of God, when he says of food, \"Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it is received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-15-P1596_872336:9-nf] This is sound doctrine, which you cannot bear, and so turn to fables. The apostle praises the creature of God, but forbids the worship of it; and in the same way Moses gives due praise to the sun and moon, while at the same time he states the fact of their having been made by God, and placed by Him in their courses,-the sun to rule the day, and the moon to rule the night. Probably you think Moses spared nothing divine, simply because he forbade the worship of the sun and moon, whereas you turn towards them in all directions in your worship. But the sun and moon take no pleasure in your false praises. It is the devil, the transgressor, that delights in false praises. The powers of heaven, who have not fallen by sin, wish their Creator to be praised in them; and their true praise is that which does no wrong to their Creator. He is wronged when they are said to be His members, or parts of His substance. For He is perfect and independent, underived, not divided or scattered in space, but unchangeably self-existent, self-sufficient, and blessed in Himself. In the abundance of His goodness, He by His word spoke, and they were made: He commanded, and they were created. And if earthly bodies are good, of which the apostle spoke when he said that no food is unclean, because every creature of God is good, much more the heavenly bodies, of which the sun and moon are the chief; for the apostle says again, \"The glory of the terrestrial is one, and the glory of the celestial is another.\"[fn-15-P1597_873853:10-nf] ","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_114_tractate_cix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. In this prayer, therefore, Jesus may seem to have omitted praying for some of His own, unless we carefully examine His words in the prayer itself. For if He prayed first for those, as we have already shown, who were then with Him, and afterwards for those also who should believe on Him through their word, it may be said that He prayed not for those who were neither with Him when He so spake, nor afterwards believed through their word, but had done so at some previous time either of themselves, or in some other supposable manner. For was Nathanael with Him at that time?[fn-35-P3510_1949490:2-nf] Was Joseph of Arimathea, who begged His body from Pilate, and of whom this same evangelist John testifies that he was already His disciple?[fn-35-P3511_1949823:3-nf] Were His mother, Mary, and other women who, we know from the Gospel, had been prior to that time His disciples? Were those with Him then, of whom this evangelist John frequently says, \"Many believed on Him\"?[fn-35-P3512_1950049:4-nf] For whence came the multitude of those who, with branches of trees, partly preceded and partly followed Him as He sat on the ass, saying, \"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord ;\" and along with them the children of whom He Himself declared that the prophecy had been uttered, \"Out of the mouth of babes and of sucklings Thou hast perfected praise\"?[fn-35-P3513_1950462:5-nf] Whence the five hundred brethren, to all of whom at once He would not have appeared after His resurrection[fn-35-P3514_1950599:6-nf] had they not previously believed on Him? Whence that hundred and nine who, with the eleven, were a hundred and twenty, when, being assembled together after His ascension, they waited and received the promise of the Holy Spirit?[fn-35-P3515_1950844:7-nf] Whence came all these, save from those of Whom it was said, \"Many believed on Him\"? For them, therefore, the Saviour did not at this time pray, seeing it was for those He prayed who were then with Him, and for others not who had already, but who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But these were certainly not with Him on that occasion, and had already believed on Him at some previous period. I say nothing of the aged Simeon, who believed on Him when an infant; of Anna the prophetess;[fn-35-P3516_1951370:8-nf] of Zachariah and Elisabeth, who prophesied of Him before He was born of the Virgin;[fn-35-P3517_1951473:9-nf] of their son John, His forerunner, the friend of the Bridegroom, who both recognized Him in the Holy Spirit, and preached Him in His absence, and pointed Him out when He was present to the recognition of others;[fn-35-P3518_1951712:10-nf] -I say nothing of these, as it might be replied that He ought not to have prayed for such when dead, who had gone hence with their great merits, and having met with a welcome reception were now at rest; for a similar answer is also given in connection with the righteous of olden time. For which of them could have been saved from the damnation awaiting the whole mass of perdition, which has been caused by one man, had he not believed, through the revelation of the Spirit, in the one Mediator between God and men as yet to come in the flesh?

Accordingly it remains that if we are to believe that the Lord Jesus, in this prayer, prayed for all of His own who either then were or should thereafter be in this life, which is a state of trial upon earth,[fn-35-P3525_1955083:14-nf] we must so understand the expression, \"through their word,\" as to believe that it here signified the word of faith itself which they preached in the world, and that it was called their word because it was primarily and principally preached by them. For it was already in the course of being preached by them in the earth when Paul received that same word of theirs by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whence also it came about that he compared the Gospel with them, lest by any means he had run, or should run, in vain; and they gave him their right hand because in him also they found, although not given him by them, their own word which they were already preaching, and in which they were now established.[fn-35-P3526_1955990:15-nf] And in regard to this word of the resurrection of Christ, it is said by the same apostle, \"Whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so ye believed;\"[fn-35-P3527_1956164:16-nf] and again, \"This is the word of faith,\" he says, \"which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-35-P3528_1956412:17-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles we read that in Christ, God hath marked out [the ground of] faith unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.[fn-35-P3529_1956585:18-nf] Accordingly, this word of faith, because principally and primarily preached by the apostles who adhered to Him, was called their word. Not, however, on that account does it cease to be the word of God because it is called their word; for the same apostle says that the Thessalonians received it from him \"not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God.\"[fn-35-P3530_1956977:19-nf] \"Of God,\" for the very reason that it was freely given by God; but called \"their word,\" because primarily and principally committed to them by God to be preached. In the same way also the thief mentioned above had in the matter of his own faith their word, which was called theirs precisely because the preaching of it primarily and principally pertained to the office they filled. And once more, when murmuring arose among the Grecian widows in reference to the serving of the tables, previous to the time when Paul was brought to the faith of Christ, the reply given by the apostles, who before then had adhered to the Lord, was: \"It is not good that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\"[fn-35-P3531_1957704:20-nf] Then it was that they provided for the ordination of deacons, that they themselves might not be drawn aside from the duty of preaching the word. Hence that was properly enough called their word which is the word of faith, whereby all, from whatever quarter they had heard it, believed on Christ, or, as yet to hear it, should thereafter believe. In this prayer, therefore, all whom He redeemed, whether then alive or thereafter to live in the flesh, were prayed for by our Redeemer when, praying for the apostles who were then with Him, He also conjoined those who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But what, after such conjunction, He then proceeds to say, must be reserved for discussion in another discourse.","title":"Tractate CIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":45,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_29_on_the_creation_of_the_world","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"ANF-07","text":"And thus in the sixth Psalm for the eighth day,[fn-45-P4503_1733947:10-nf] David asks the Lord that He would not rebuke him in His anger, nor judge him in His fury; for this is indeed the eighth day of that future judgment, which will pass beyond the order of the sevenfold arrangement. Jesus also, the son of Nave, the successor of Moses, himSelf broke the Sabbath-day; for on the Sabbath-day he commanded the children of Israel[fn-45-P4504_1734365:11-nf] to go round the walls of the city of Jericho with trumpets, and declare war against the aliens. Matthias[fn-45-P4505_1734487:12-nf] also, prince of Judah, broke the Sabbath; for he slew the prefect of Antiochus the king of Syria on the Sabbath, and subdued the foreigners by pursuing them.

There is not, to be sure, anything remaining which may be remitted whenever, as the Scripture says, \"the Lord forgiveth all our iniquities.\"[fn-40-P4002_1514705:95-nf] But until that happens which immediately follows in the same passage, \"Who healeth all thine infirmities, who redeemeth thy life from corruption,\"[fn-40-P4003_1514870:96-nf] there remains this concupiscence of the flesh in the body of this death. Now we are admonished not to obey its sinful desires to do evil: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body.\"[fn-40-P4004_1515067:97-nf] Still this concupiscence is daily lessened in persons of continence and increasing years, and most of all when old age makes a near approach. The man, however, who yields to it a wicked service, receives such great energies that, even when all his members are now failing through age, and those especial parts of his body are unable to be applied to their proper function, he does not ever cease to revel in a still increasing rage of disgraceful and shameless desire.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_28_book_xxii","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Whatever, therefore, has been taken from the body, either during life or after death shall be restored to it, and, in conjunction with what has remained in the grave, shall rise again, transformed from the oldness of the animal body into the newness of the spiritual body, and clothed in incorruption and immortality. But even though the body has been all quite ground to powder by some severe accident, or by the ruthlessness of enemies, and though it has been so diligently scattered to the winds, or into the water, that there is no trace of it left, yet it shall not be beyond the omnipotence of the Creator,-no, not a hair of its head shall perish. The flesh shall then be spiritual, and subject to the spirit, but still flesh, not spirit, as the spirit itself, when subject to the flesh, was fleshly, but still spirit and not flesh. And of this we have experimental proof in the deformity of our penal condition. For those persons were carnal, not in a fleshly, but in a spiritual way, to whom the apostle said, \"I could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.\"[fn-44-P4477_2467195:48-nf] And a man is in this life spiritual in such a way, that he is yet carnal with respect to his body, and sees another law in his members warring against the law of his mind; but even in his body he will be spiritual when the same flesh shall have had that resurrection of which these words speak, \"It is sown an animal body, it shall rise a spiritual body.\"[fn-44-P4478_2467571:49-nf] But what this spiritual body shall be and how great its grace, I fear it were but rash to pronounce, seeing that we have as yet no experience of it.

On this account, although I am conscious of extreme poverty, I do not cease to imitate the ostentatious among entertainers, both setting before you my table continuously, and placing on it the cup of my teaching, filled full: for I see that after having drunk it all, you retire again thirsting. And this indeed has become evident during the whole time, but especially since the last Lord's Day: For that ye partake of the divine oracles insatiably, that day particularly shewed: whereon I discoursed about the unlawfulness of speaking ill one of another, when I furnished you witha sure subject for self accusation, suggesting that you should speak ill of your own sins, but should not busy yourselves about those of other people: when I brought forward the Saints as accusing themselves indeed, but sparing others: Paul saying I am the chief of sinners, and that God had compassion on him who was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious,[fn-9-P990_660438:1-nf] and calling himself one born out of due time, and not even thinking himself worthy of the title of Apostle:[fn-9-P991_660567:2-nf] Peter saying \"Depart from me because I am a sinful man:\"[fn-9-P992_660644:3-nf] Matthew styling himself a publican even in the days of his Apostleship:[fn-9-P993_660731:4-nf] David crying out and saying \"My iniquities have gone over my head, and as a heavy burden have been burdensome to me:\"[fn-9-P994_660865:5-nf] and Isaiah lamenting and bewailing \"I am unclean, and have unclean lips:\"[fn-9-P995_660959:6-nf] The three children in the furnace of fire, confessing and saying that they have sinned and transgressed, and have not kept the commandments of God. Daniel again makes the same lamentation. When after the enumeration of these Saints, I called their accusers flies, and introduced the right reason for the comparison, saying, that just as they fasten themselves upon the wounds of others, so also the accusers bite at other people's sins, collecting disease therefrom for their acquaintance, and those who do the opposite, I designated bees, not gathering together diseases, but building honeycombs with the greatest devotion, and so flying to the meadow of the virtue of the Saint: Then accordingly-then ye shewed your insatiable longing. For when my discourse was extended to some length, yea to an interminable length, such as never was, many indeed expected that your eagerness would be quenched by the abundance of what was said. But the contrary happened. For your heart was the rather warmed, your desire was the rather kindled: and whence was this evident? The acclamations at least which took place at the end were greater, and the shouts more clear, and the same thing took place as at the forge. For as there at the beginning indeed the light of the fire is not very clear, but when the flame has caught the whole of the wood that is laid upon it, it is raised to a great height; so also accordingly this happened on the occasion of that day. At the beginning indeed, this assembly was not vehemently stirred by me. But when the discourse was extended to some length, and gradually took hold of all the subjects and the teaching spread more widely, then accordingly, then the desire of listening was kindled in you, and the applause broke forth, more vehemently. On this account, although I had been prepared to say less than was spoken, I then exceeded the measure, nay rather I never exceeded the measure. For I am wont to measure the amount of the teaching not by the multitude of the words spoken, but by the disposition of the audience. For he who meets with a disgusted audience, even if he abridge his teaching, seems to be vexatious, but he who meets with eager, and wide-awake, and attentive hearers, though he extend his discourse to some length, not even thus fulfils their desire.","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":15,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We must follow, then, the clue[fn-53-P5325_1655790:82-nf] of our discussion, meeting every effort of our opponents with reciprocal vigor. I say that my Gospel is the true one; Marcion, that his is. I affirm that Marcion's Gospel is adulterated; Marcion, that mine is. Now what is to settle the point for us, except it be that principle[fn-53-P5326_1656094:83-nf] of time, which rules that the authority lies with that which shall be found to be more ancient; and assumes as an elemental truth,[fn-53-P5327_1656237:84-nf] that corruption (of doctrine) belongs to the side which shall be convicted of comparative lateness in its origin.[fn-53-P5328_1656370:85-nf] For, inasmuch as error[fn-53-P5329_1656549:86-nf] is falsification of truth, it must needs be that truth therefore precede error. A thing must exist prior to its suffering any casualty;[fn-53-P5330_1656698:87-nf] and an object[fn-53-P5331_1656727:88-nf] must precede all rivalry to itself. Else how absurd it would be, that, when we have proved our position to be the older one, and Marcion's the later, ours should yet appear to be the false one, before it had even received from truth its objective existence;[fn-53-P5332_1656999:89-nf] and Marcion's should also be supposed to have experienced rivalry at our hands, even before its publication; and, in fine, that that should be thought to be the truer position which is the later one-a century[fn-53-P5333_1657235:90-nf] later than the publication of all the many and great facts and records of the Christian religion, which certainly could not have been published without, that is to say, before, the truth of the gospel. With regard, then, to the pending[fn-53-P5334_1657490:91-nf] question, of Luke's Gospel (so far as its being the common property[fn-53-P5335_1657572:92-nf] of ourselves and Marcion enables it to be decisive of the truth,[fn-53-P5336_1657657:93-nf] ) that portion of it which we alone receive[fn-53-P5337_1657729:94-nf] is so much older than Marcion, that Marcion, himself once believed it, when in the first warmth of faith he contributed money to the Catholic church, which along with himself was afterwards rejected,[fn-53-P5338_1657984:95-nf] when he fell away from our truth into his own heresy. What if the Marcionites have denied that he held the primitive faith amongst ourselves, in the face even of his own letter? What, if they do not acknowledge the letter? They, at any rate, receive his Antitheses; and more than that, they make ostentatious use[fn-53-P5339_1658337:96-nf] of them. Proof out of these is enough for me. For if the Gospel, said to be Luke's which is current amongst us[fn-53-P5340_1658465:97-nf] (we shall see whether it be also current with Marcion), is the very one which, as Marcion argues in his Antitheses, was interpolated by the defenders of Judaism, for the purpose of such a conglomeration with it of the law and the prophets as should enable them out of it to fashion their Christ, surely he could not have so argued about it, unless he had found it (in such a form). No one censures things before they exist,[fn-53-P5341_1658905:98-nf] when he knows not whether they will come to pass. Emendation never precedes the fault. To be sure,[fn-53-P5342_1659022:99-nf] an amender of that Gospel, which had been all topsy-turvy[fn-53-P5343_1659092:100-nf] from the days of Tiberius to those of Antoninus, first presented himself in Marcion alone-so long looked for by Christ, who was all along regretting that he had been in so great a hurry to send out his apostles without the support of Marcion! But for all that,[fn-53-P5344_1659368:101-nf] heresy, which is for ever mending the Gospels, and corrupting them in the act, is an affair of man's audacity, not of God's authority; and if Marcion be even a disciple, he is yet not \"above his master; \"[fn-53-P5345_1659591:102-nf] if Marcion be an apostle, still as Paul says, \"Whether it be I or they, so we preach; \"[fn-53-P5346_1659699:103-nf] if Marcion be a prophet, even \"the spirits of the prophets will be subject to the prophets,\"[fn-53-P5347_1659814:104-nf] for they are not the authors of confusion, but of peace; or if Marcion be actually an angel, he must rather be designated \"as anathema than as a preacher of the gospel,\"[fn-53-P5348_1660007:105-nf] because it is a strange gospel which he has preached. So that, whilst he amends, he only confirms both positions: both that our Gospel is the prior one, for he amends that which he has previously fallen in with; and that that is the later one, which, by putting it together out of the emendations of ours, he has made his own Gospel, and a novel one too.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"185","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"It is obvious that Eunomius and Aetius held the same opinions. In several passages of his writings, Eunomius boasts and frequently testifies that Aetius was his instructor. Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen, speaks in the following terms of Apolinarius in a letter addressed to Nectarius, the leader of the church in Constantinople:[fn-42-P4205_1847175:60-nf] \"Eunomius, who is a constant source of trouble among us, is not content with being a burden to us himself, but would consider himself to blame if he did not strive to drag every one with him to the destruction whither he is hastening. Such conduct, however, may be tolerated in some degree. The most grievous calamity against which the Church has now to struggle arises from the audacity of the Apolinarians. I know not how your Holiness could have agreed that they should be as free to hold meetings as we ourselves. You have been fully instructed by the grace of God, in the Divine mysteries, and not only understand the defense of the Word of God, but also whatever innovations have been made by heretics against the sound faith; yet it may not be amiss for your revered Excellency to hear from our narrowness, that a book written by Apolinarius has fallen into my hands, in which the proposition surpasses all forms of heretical pravity. He affirms that the flesh assumed for the transformation of our nature, under the dispensation of the only begotten Son of God was not acquired for this end; but that this carnal nature existed in the Son from the beginning. He substantiates this evil hypothesis by a misapplication of the following words of Scripture: `No man hath ascended up into heaven.'[fn-42-P4206_1848519:61-nf] He alleges from this text, that Christ was the Son of man before He descended from heaven, and that when He did descend, He brought with Him His own flesh which He had already possessed in heaven which was before the ages and essentially united. He also states another apostolic saying: `The second man is from heaven.'[fn-42-P4207_1848858:62-nf] He, moreover, maintains that the man who came down from heaven was destitute of intellect (nouj), but that the Deity of the only begotten Son fulfilled the nature of intellect, and constituted the third part of the human compound. The body and soul (yuxh) formed two parts, as in other men, but there was no intellect, but the Word of God filled the place of intellect. Nor does this end the awful spectacle; for the most grievous point of the heresy is, that he asserts that the only-begotten God, the Judge of all men, the Giver of life, and the Destroyer of death, is Himself subject to death; that He suffered in His own Godhead, and that in the resurrection of the body in the third day, the Godhead also was raised from the dead with the body; and that it was raised again from the dead by the Father. It would take too long to recount all the other extravagant doctrines propounded by these heretics.\" What I have said may, I think, suffice to show the nature of the sentiments maintained by Apolinarius and Eunomius. If any one desire more detailed information, I can only refer him to the works on the subject written either by them or by others concerning these men. I do not profess easily to understand or to expound these matters, as it seems to me the fact that these dogmas did not prevail and make further advance is to be attributed, in addition to the causes mentioned, especially to the monks of that period; for all those philosophers in Syria, Cappadocia, and the neighboring provinces, were sincerely attached to the Nicene faith. The eastern regions, however, from Cilicia to Phoenicia, were endangered by the heresy of Apolinarius. The heresy of Eunomius was spread from Cilicia and the mountains of Taurus as far as the Hellespont and Constantinople. These two heretics found it easy to attract to their respective parties the persons among whom they dwelt, and those of the neighborhood. But the same fate awaited them that had been experienced by the Arians; for the people admired the monks who manifested their virtue by works and believed that they held right opinions, while they turned away from those who held other opinions, as impious and as holding spurious doctrines. In the same way the Egyptians were led by the monks to oppose the Arians.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":15,"verse":53,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_30_commentary_on_the_apocalypse_of_the_blessed_john","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-07","text":"16. \"And He had in His right hand seven stars.\"] He said that in His right hand He had seven stars, because the Holy Spirit of sevenfold agency was given into His power by the Father.

Not that they are themselves the only, or even the principal churches; but what he says to one, he says to all. For they are in no respect different, that on that ground any one should prefer them to the larger number of similar small ones. In the whole world Paul taught that all the churches are arranged by sevens, that they are called seven, and that the Catholic Church is one. And first of all, indeed, that he himself also might maintain the type of seven churches, he did not exceed that number. But he wrote to the Romans, to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Thessalonians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians; afterwards he wrote to individual persons, so as not to exceed the number of seven churches. And abridging in a short space his announcement, he thus says to Timothy: \"That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the Church of the living God.\"[fn-45-P4582_1749774:18-nf] We read also that this typical number is announced by the Holy Spirit by the month of Isaiah: \"Of seven women which took hold of one man.\"[fn-45-P4583_1749934:19-nf] The one man is Christ, not born of seed; but the seven women are seven churches, receiving His bread, and clothed with his apparel, who ask that their reproach should be taken away, only that His name should be called upon them. The bread is the Holy Spirit, which nourishes to eternal life, promised to them, that is, by faith. And His garments wherewith they desire to be clothed are the glory of immortality, of which Paul the apostle says: \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on mortality.\"[fn-45-P4584_1750484:20-nf] Moreover, they ask that their reproach may be taken away-that is, that they may be cleansed from their sins: for the reproach is the original sin which is taken away in baptism, and they begin to be called Christian men, which is, \"Let thy name be called upon us.\" Therefore in these seven churches, of one Catholic Church are believers, because it is one in seven by the quality of faith and election. Whether writing to them who labour in the world, and live[fn-45-P4585_1750965:21-nf] of the frugality of their labours, and are patient, and when they see certain men in the Church wasters, and pernicious, they hear them, lest there should become dissension, he yet admonishes them by love, that in what respects their faith is deficient they should repent; or to those who dwell in cruel places among persecutors, that they should continue faithful; or to those who, under the pretext of mercy, do unlawful sins in the Church, and make them manifest to be done by others; or to those that are at ease in the Church; or to those who are negligent, and Christians only in name; or to those who are meekly instructed, that they may bravely persevere in faith; or to those who study the Scriptures, and labour to know the mysteries of their announcement, and are unwilling to do God's work that is mercy and love: to all he urges penitence, to all he declares judgment.","title":"Commentary on the Apocalypse of the Blessed John","author":"Victorinus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Carefully consider the rest of his remarks: \"This likewise,\" says he, \"is confirmed by the apostle's authority.

When Abraham, struck with fear among a foreign nation, said that Sarah, his wife, was his sister, it is said that Abimelech, the king of the country, abducted her for a night's enjoyment of her. But God, who had the holy woman's honour in His keeping, appeared to Abimelech in his sleep, and restrained the royal audacity; threatening him with death if he went to the length of violating the wife. Then Abimelech said: `Wilt thou, O Lord, slay an innocent and righteous nation? Did they not tell me that they were brother and sister? Therefore Abimelech arose early in the morning, and took a thousand pieces of silver, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and sent away his wife untouched. But Abraham prayed unto God for Abimelech; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants.'\"[fn-42-P4234_1601230:64-nf] Now why he narrated all this at so great a length, you may find in these few words which he added: \"God,\" he says, \"at the prayer of Abraham, restored their potency of generation, which had been taken away from the wombs of even the meanest servants; because God had closed up every womb in the house of Abimelech[fn-42-P4235_1601582:65-nf] Consider now,\" says he, \"whether that ought to be called a natural evil which sometimes God when angry takes away, and when appeased restores. He,\" says he, \"makes the children both of the pious and of the ungodly, inasmuch as the circumstance of their being parents appertains to that nature which rejoices in God as its Author, whilst the fact of their impiety belongs to the depravity of their desires, and this comes to every person whatever as the consequence of free will.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now to this lengthy statement of his we have to say in answer, that, in the passages which he has quoted from the sacred writings, there is nothing said about that shameful lust, which we say did not exist in the body of our first parents in their blessedness, when they were naked and were not ashamed.[fn-42-P4239_1602464:66-nf] The first passage from the apostle was spoken of the seeds of corn, which first die in order to be quickened.

It is on the same principle, indeed, that he says in another passage: \"By the law is the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-43-P4326_1640721:99-nf] \"Nevertheless,\" says he, \"death reigned from Adam to Moses;\"[fn-43-P4327_1640802:100-nf] that is, as he had already expressed it, \"until the law.\" Not that there was no sin after Moses, but because even the law, which was given by Moses, was unable to deprive death of its power, which, of course, reigns only by sin. Its reign, too, is such as to plunge mortal man even into that second death which is to endure for evermore. \"Death reigned,\" but over whom? \"Even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that was to come.\"[fn-43-P4328_1641317:101-nf] Of whom that was to come, if not Christ? And in what sort a figure, except in the way of contrariety? which he elsewhere briefly expresses: \"As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\"[fn-43-P4329_1641541:102-nf] The one condition was in one, even as the other condition was in the other; this is the figure. But this figure is not conformable in every respect; accordingly the apostle, following up the same idea, added, \"But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.\"[fn-43-P4330_1641983:103-nf] But why \"hath it much more abounded,\" except it be that all who are delivered through Christ suffer temporal death on Adam's account, but have everlasting life in store for the sake of Christ Himself? \"And not as it was by one that sinned,\" says he, \"so is the gift: for the judgment was from one to condemnation, but the free gift is from many offences unto justification.\"[fn-43-P4331_1642378:104-nf] \"By one\" what, but offence? since it is added, \"the free gift is from many offences.\" Let these objectors tell us how it can be \"by one offence unto condemnation,\" unless it be that even the one original sin which has passed over unto all men is sufficient for condemnation? Whereas the free gift delivers from many offences to justification, because it not only cancels the one offence, which is derived from the primal sin, but all others also which are added in every individual man by the motion of his own will. \"For if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace and righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ. Therefore, by the offence of one upon all men to condemnation; so by the righteousness of one upon all men unto justification of life.\"[fn-43-P4332_1643210:105-nf] Let them after this persist intheir vain imaginations, and maintain that one man did not hand on sin by propagation, but only set the example of committing it. How is it, then, that by one's offence judgment comes on all men to condemnation, and not rather by each man's own numerous sins, unless it be that even if there were but that one sin, it is sufficient, without the addition of any more, to lead to condemnation,-as, indeed, it does lead all who die in infancy who are born of Adam, without being born again in Christ? Why, then, does he, when he refuses to hear the apostle, ask us for an answer to his question, \"By what means may sin be discovered in an infant,-through the will, or through marriage, or through its parents?\" Let him listen in silence, and hear by what means sin may be discovered in an infant. \"By the offence of one,\" says the apostle, \"upon all men to condemnation.\" He said, moreover, all to condemnation through Adam, and all to justification through Christ: not, of course, that Christ removes to life all those who die in Adam; but he said \"all\" and \"all,\" because, as without Adam no one goes to death, so without Christ no man to life. Just as we say of a teacher of letters, when he is alone in a town: This man teaches all their learning; not because all the inhabitants take lessons, but because no man who learns at all is taught by any but him. Indeed, the apostle afterwards designates as many those whom he had previously described as all, meaning the self-same persons by the two different terms. \"For,\" says he, \"as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.\"[fn-43-P4333_1644904:106-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":52,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"As to the passage, which he seemed to himself to indite in a pious vein, as it were, \"If nature is of God, there cannot be original sin in it,\" would not another person seem even to him to give a still more pious turn to it, thus: \"If nature is of God, there cannot arise any sin in it?\" And yet this is not true. The Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they endeavoured to steep in all sorts of evil the very nature of God itself, and not His creature, made out of nothing. For evil arose in nothing else than what was good-not, however, the supreme and unchangeable good which is God's nature, but that which was made out of nothing by the wisdom of God. This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine work; for he would not be man unless he were made by the operation of God. But evil would not exist in infants, if evil had not been committed by the wilfulness of the first man, and original sin derived from a nature thus corrupted. It is not true, then, as he puts it, \"He is completely a Manichean who maintains original sin;\" but rather,he is completely a Pelagian who does not believe in original sin. For it is not simply from the time when the pestilent opinions of Manichaeus began to grow that in the Church of God infants about to be baptized were for the first time exorcised with exsufflation,-which ceremonial was intended to show that they were not removed into the kingdom of Christ without first being delivered from the power of darkness;[fn-43-P4349_1652384:110-nf] nor is it in the books of Manichaeus that we read how \"the Son of man come to seek and to save that which was lost,\"[fn-43-P4350_1652520:111-nf] or how \"by one man sin entered into the world,\"[fn-43-P4351_1652589:112-nf] with those other similar passages which we have quoted above; or how God \"visits the sins of the fathers upon the children;\"[fn-43-P4352_1652733:113-nf] or how it is written in the Psalm, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-43-P4353_1652852:114-nf] or again, how \"man was made like unto vanity: his days pass away like a shadow;\"[fn-43-P4354_1652951:115-nf] or again, \"behold, Thou hast made my days old, and my existence as nothing before Thee; nay, every man living is altogether vanity;\"[fn-43-P4355_1653105:116-nf] or how the apostle says, \"every creature was made subject to vanity;\"[fn-43-P4356_1653196:117-nf] or how it is written in the book of Ecclesiastes, \"vanity of vanities; all is vanity: what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?\"[fn-43-P4357_1653377:118-nf] and in the book of Ecclesiasticus, \"a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam from the day that they go out of their mother's womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things;\"[fn-43-P4358_1653585:119-nf] or how again the apostle writes, \"in Adam all die;\"[fn-43-P4359_1653659:120-nf] or how holy Job says, when speaking about his own sins, \"for man that is born of a woman is short-lived and full of wrath: as the flower of grass, so does he fall; and he departs like a shadow, nor shall he stay.

Neither should we stumble at the circumstance that the same Matthew has stated that the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the Lord, and asked Him by what authority He did these things, and who gave Him this authority, on the occasion when He to, in turn, interrogated them concerning the baptism of John, inquiring whence it was, whether from heaven or of men; to whom also, on their replying that they did not know, He said, \"Neither do I tell you by what authority I do those things.\" For he has followed up this with the words introduced in the immediate context, \"But what think ye? A certain man had two sons,\" and so forth. Thus this discourse is brought into a connection which is continued, uninterrupted by the interposition either of any thing or of any person, down to what is related regarding the vineyard which was let out to the husbandmen. It may, indeed, be supposed that He spake all these words to the chief priests and the eiders of the people, by whom He had been interrogated with regard to His authority. But then, if these persons had indeed questioned Him with a view to tempt Him, and with a hostile intention, they could not be taken for men who had believed, and who cited the remarkable testimony in favour of the Lord which was taken from a prophet; and surely it is only if they had the character of those who believed, and not of those who were ignorant, that they could have given a reply like this: \"He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen.\" This peculiarity [of Matthew's account], however, should not by any means so perplex us as to lead us to imagine that there were none who believed among the multitudes who listened at this time to the Lord's parables. For it is only for the sake of brevity that the same Matthew has passed over in silence what Luke does not fail to mention,-namely, the fact that the said parable was not spoken only to the parties who had interrogated Him on the subject of His authority, but to the people. For the latter evangelist puts it thus: \"Then began He to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard,\" and so on. Accordingly, we may well understand that among the people then assembled there might also have been persons who could listen to Him as those did who before this had said, \"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord;\" and that either these, or some of them, were the individuals who replied in the words, \"He will miserably destroy these wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen.\" The answer actually returned by these men, moreover, has been attributed to the Lord Himself by Mark and Luke, not only because their words were really His words, inasmuch[fn-21-P2117_880795:496-nf] as He is the Truth that ofttimes speaks even by the wicked and the ignorant, moving the mind of man by a certain hidden instinct, not in the merit of man's holiness, but by the right of His own proper power; but also because the men may have been of a character admitting of their being reckoned, not without reason, as already members in the true body of Christ, so that what was said by them might quite warrantably be ascribed to Him whose members they were. For by this time He had baptized more than John,[fn-21-P2118_881412:497-nf] and had multitudes of disciples, as the same evangelists repeatedly testify; and from among these followers He also drew those five hundred brethren, to whom the Apostle Paul tells us that He showed Himself after His resurrection.[fn-21-P2119_881662:498-nf] And this explanation of the matter is supported by the fact that the phrase which occurs in the version. by this same Matthew,-namely, \"They say unto Him,[fn-21-P2120_881838:499-nf] He will miserably destroy those wicked men,\"-is not put in a form necessitating us to take the pronoun illi in the plural number, as if it was intended to mark out the words expressly as the reply made by the persons who had craftily questioned Him on the subject of His authority; but the clause, \"They say unto Him,\"[fn-21-P2121_882177:500-nf] is so expressed that the term illi should be taken for the singular pronoun, and not the plural, and should be held to signify \"unto Him,\" that is to say, unto the Lord Himself, as is made clear in the Greek codices,[fn-21-P2122_882413:501-nf] without a single atom of ambiguity.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":50,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"29. Unless Christ had considered this Sabbath-which in your want of knowledge and of piety you laugh at-one of the prophecies written of Himself, He would not have borne such a testimony to it as He did. For when, as you say in praise of Christ, He suffered voluntarily, and so could choose His own time for suffering and for resurrection, He brought it about that His body rested from all its works on Sabbath in the tomb, and that His resurrection on the third day. which we call the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, and therefore the eighth, proved the circumcision of the eighth day to be also prophetical of Him. For what does circumcision mean, but the eradication of the mortality which comes from our carnal generation? So the apostle says: \"Putting off from Himself His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers, triumphing over them in Himself.\"[fn-17-P1736_979119:52-nf] The flesh here said to be put off is that mortality of flesh on account of which the body is properly called flesh. The flesh is the mortality, for in the immortality of the resurrection there will be no flesh; as it is written, \"Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\" You are accustomed to argue from these words against our faith in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, which has already taken place in the Lord Himself. You keep out of view the following words, in which the apostle explains his meaning. To show what he here means by flesh, he adds, \"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" For this body, which from its mortality is properly called flesh, is changed in the resurrection, so as to be no longer corruptible and mortal. This is the apostle's statement, and not a supposition of ours, as his next words prove. \"Lo\" he says, \"I show you a mystery: we shall all use again, but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the last trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-17-P1737_980339:53-nf] To put on immortality, the body puts off mortality. This is the mystery of circumcision, which by the law took place on the eighth day; and on the eighth day, the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, was fulfilled in its true meaning by the Lord. Hence it is said, \"Putting off His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers.\" For by means of this mortality the hostile powers of hell ruled over us. Christ is said to have made a show or example of these, because in Himself, our Head, He gave an example which will be fully realized in the liberation of His whole body, the Church, from the power of the devil at the last resurrection. This is our faith. And according to the prophetic declaration quoted by Paul, \"The just shall live by faith.\" This is our justification.[fn-17-P1738_981146:54-nf] Even Pagans believe that Christ died. But only Christians believe that Christ rose again. \"If thou confess with thy mouth,\" says the apostle, \"that Jesus is the Lord, and believest in thy heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-17-P1739_981431:55-nf] Again, because we are justified by faith in Christ's resurrection, the apostle says, \"He died for our offenses, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-17-P1740_981598:56-nf] And because this resurrection by faith in which we are justified was prefigured by the circumcision of the eighth day, the apostle says of Abraham, with whom the observance began, \"He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith.\"[fn-17-P1741_981874:57-nf] Circumcision, then, is one of the prophecies of Christ, written by Moses, of whom Christ said, \"He wrote of me.\" In the words of the Lord, \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,\"[fn-17-P1742_982214:58-nf] it is not the circumcision of the proselyte which is meant, but his imitation of the conduct of the scribes and Pharisees, which the Lord forbids His disciples to imitate, when He says: \"The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat: what they say unto you, do; but do not after their works; for they say, and do not.\"[fn-17-P1743_982554:59-nf] These words of the Lord teach us both the honor due to the teaching of Moses, in whose seat even bad men were obliged to teach good things, and the reason of the proselyte becoming a child of hell, which was not that he heard from the Pharisees the words of the law, but that he copied their example. Such a circumcised proselyte might have been addressed in the words of Paul: \"Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law.\"[fn-17-P1744_983011:60-nf] His imitation of the Pharisees in not keeping the law made him a child of hell. And he was twofold more than they, probably because of his neglecting to fulfill what he voluntarily undertook, when, not being born a Jew, he chose to become a Jew.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":53,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_113_letter_lix_to_epictetus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"6. And this above all shews the foolishness of those who say that the Word was changed into bones and flesh. For if this had been so, there were no need of a tomb. For the Body would have gone by itself to preach to the spirits in Hades. But as it was, He Himself went to preach, while the Body Joseph wrapped in a linen cloth, and laid it away at Golgotha[fn-100-P10050_3596617:20-nf] . And so it is shewn to all that the Body was not the Word, but Body of the Word. And it was this that Thomas handled when it had risen from the dead, and saw in it the print of the nails, which the Word Himself had undergone, seeing them fixed in His own Body, and though able to prevent it, did not do so. On the contrary, the incorporeal Word made His own the properties of the Body, as being His own Body. Why, when the Body was struck by the attendant, as suffering Himself He asked, `Why smitest thou Me[fn-100-P10051_3597145:21-nf] ?' And being by nature intangible, the Word yet said, `I gave My back to the stripes, and My cheeks to blows, and hid not My face from shame and spitting[fn-100-P10052_3597319:22-nf] .' For what the human Body of the Word suffered, this the Word, dwelling in the body, ascribed to Himself, in order that we might be enabled to be partakers of the Godhead of the Word[fn-100-P10053_3597519:23-nf] . And verily it is strange that He it was Who suffered and yet suffered not. Suffered, because His own Body suffered, and He was in it, which thus suffered; suffered not, because the Word, being by Nature God, is impassible. And while He, the incorporeal, was in the passible Body, the Body had in it the impassible Word, which was destroying the infirmities inherent in the Body. But this He did, and so it was, in order that Himself taking what was ours and offering it as a sacrifice, He might do away with it, and conversely might invest us with what was His, and cause the Apostle to say: `This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality[fn-100-P10054_3598232:24-nf] .'","title":"Letter LIX.

These things being thus demonstrated, it is superfluous to touch upon the other points, or to enter upon any discussion relating to them, since the body in which the Word was is not coessential with the Godhead, but was truly born of Mary, while the Word Himself was not, changed into bones and flesh, but came in the flesh. For what John said, `The Word was made flesh[fn-100-P10058_3600290:26-nf] ,' has this meaning, as we may see by a similar passage; for it is written in Paul:`Christ has become a curse for us[fn-100-P10059_3600424:27-nf] .' And just as He has not Himself become a curse, but is said to have done so because He took upon Him the curse on our behalf, so also He has become flesh not by being changed into flesh, but because He assumed on our behalf living flesh, and has become Man. For to say `the Word became flesh,' is equivalent to saying `the Word has become man;' according to what is said in Joel: `I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-100-P10060_3600871:28-nf] ;' for the promise did not extend to the irrational animals, but is for men, on whose account the Lord is become Man. As then this is the sense of the above text, they all will reasonably condemn themselves who have thought that the flesh derived from Mary existed before her, and that the Word, prior to her, had a human soul, and existed in it always even before His coming. And they too will cease who have said that the Flesh was not accessible to death, but belonged to the immortal Nature. For if it did not die, how could Paul deliver to the Corinthians `that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures[fn-100-P10061_3601510:29-nf] ,' or how did He rise at all if He did not also die? Again, they will blush deeply who have even entertained the possibility of a Tetrad instead of a Triad resulting, if it were said that the Body was derived from Mary. For if (they argue) we say the Body is of one Essence with the Word, the Triad remains a Triad; for then the Word imports no foreign element into it; but if we admit that the Body derived from Mary is human, it follows, since the Body is foreign in Essence, and the Word is in it, that the addition of the Body causes a Tetrad instead of a Triad.","title":"Letter LIX.

We must take up the consideration of the manner in which the Lord showed Himself to the disciples after His resurrection, and that with the view not only of bringing out clearly the consistency of the four evangelists with each other on these subjects, but also of exhibiting their agreement with the Apostle Paul, who discourses of the theme in his First Epistle to the Corinthians. The statement by the latter runs in the following terms: \"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:[fn-26-P2648_1155881:290-nf] after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this day, but some are fallen asleep. After that, He was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.\"[fn-26-P2649_1156175:291-nf] Now this succession of the appearances is one which has been given by none of the evangelists. Hence we must examine whether the order which they have put on record does not stand in antagonism to this. For neither has Paul related all, nor have the evangelists included everything in their reports. And the real subject for our investigation, therefore, is the question, whether, among the incidents which do come under our notice in these various narratives, there is anything fitted to establish a discrepancy between the writers. Now Luke is the only one among the four evangelists who omits to tell us how the Lord was seen by the women, and confines his statement to the appearance of the angels. Matthew, again, informs us that He met them as they were returning from the sepulchre. Mark likewise mentions that He appeared first to Mary Magdalene; as also does John. Only Mark does not state how He manifested Himself to her, while John does give us an explanation of that. Moreover, Luke not only passes by in silence the fact that He showed Himself to the women, as I have already remarked, but also reports that two disciples, one of whom was Cleophas, talked with Him, before they recognised Him, in a strain which seems to imply that the women had related no other appearance seen by them than that of the angels who told them that He was alive. For Luke's narrative proceeds thus: \"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. And they talked together of all these things which hadhappened. And it came to pass that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus Himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden, that they should not know Him. And He said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said unto Him, Art thou only a stranger[fn-26-P2650_1158274:292-nf] in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? And He said unto them, What things? And they said unto Him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and have crucified Him. But we trusted that it had been He that should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; and when they found not His body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that He was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women said; but Him they saw[fn-26-P2651_1159194:293-nf] not.\"[fn-26-P2652_1159226:294-nf] All these things they relate, according to Luke's narrative, just as they were able to command their recollections and bethink themselves of what had been reported to them by the women, or by the disciples who had run to the sepulchre when the intelligence was conveyed to them that His body had been removed from the place. It is at the same time true that Luke himself reports only Peter to have run to the tomb, and there to have stooped down and seen the linen clothes laid by themselves, and then to have departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. This notice about Peter, moreover, is introduced previous to the narrative of these two disciples whom He found on the way, and subsequently to the story of the women who had seen the angels, and who had heard from them that Jesus had risen again; so that this position might seem to mark the period at which Peter ran to the sepulchre. But still we must suppose that Luke has inserted the passage about Peter here in the form of a recapitulation. For the time when Peter ran to the sepulchre was also the time when John ran to it; and at that point all that they had heard was simply the statement conveyed to them by the women, and in particular by Mary Magdalene, to the effect that the body had been carried away. Furthermore, the period at which the said woman brought such tidings was just the occasion when she saw the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And it was at a later point that these other things occurred, connected with the vision of the angels, and the appearance of the Lord Himself, who showed Himself twice over to the women, namely, once at the sepulchre, and a second time when He met them as they were returning from the tomb. This, however, took place previous to His being seen by those two upon the journey, one of whom was Cleophas. For, when this Cleophas was talking with the Lord, before he recognized who He was, he did not say expressly that Peter had gone to the sepulchre. But his words were these: \"Certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women said;\" which last statement is also to be understood as introduced in the form of a recapitulation. For the reference is to the report brought first of all by the women to Peter and John about the removal of the body. And thus, when Luke here informs us that Peter ran to the sepulchre, and also states how Cleophas mentioned that some of those who were with them went to the tomb, he is to be taken as attesting John's account, which bears that two persons proceeded to the sepulchre. But Luke has specified Peter alone in the first instance, just because it was to him that Mary had brought the earliest tidings. A difficulty, however, may also be felt in the circumstance that the same Luke does not say that Peter entered, but only that he stooped down and saw the linen clothes hid by themselves, and that thereupon he departed, wondering in himself; whereas John intimates that it was rather himself (for he is the disciple whom Jesus loved) that looked at the scene in this fashion, not going within the sepulchre, which he was the first to reach, but simply bending down and beholding the linen clothes laid in their place; although he also adds that he did enter the tomb afterwards. The explanation, therefore, is simply this, that Peter at first did stoop down and look in after the fashion which Luke specifies, but to which John makes no allusion; and that he went actually in somewhat later, but still before John entered. And in this way we shall find that all these writers have given a true account of what occurred in terms which betray no discrepancies.[fn-26-P2653_1163093:295-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"85. Let us therefore compare what is said by the Apostle Paul with the view of deciding whether it raises any question of difficulty. His statement proceeds thus: \"That He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen of Cephas.\"[fn-27-P2722_1208290:349-nf] He does not say, \"He was seen first of Cephas\" For this would be inconsistent with the fact that it is recorded in the Gospel that He appeared first to the women. He continues thus: \"then of the twelve;\" and whoever the individuals may have been to whom He then showed Himself, and whatever the precise hour, this was at least on the very day of His resurrection. Again he goes on: \"After that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.\" And whether these were gathered together with the eleven when the doors were shut for fear of the Jews, and when Jesus came to them after Thomas had gone out from the company, or whether the reference is to some other appearance subsequent to these eight days, no discrepancy is created. Again he says, \"after that He was seen of James.\" We ought not, however, to suppose this to mean that this was the first occasion on which He was seen of James; but we may take it to allude to some special appearance to that apostle by himself. Next he adds, \"then of all the apostles,\" which does not imply that this was the first time that He showed Himself to them, but that from this period He lived in more familiar intercourse with them on to the day of His ascension. Finally he says, \"And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.\" But that was a revelation of Himself from heaven some considerable time after His ascension.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_30_on_the_creed_a_sermon_to_the_catechumens_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"13.

If he had built a temple for the sun or moon or some star or some angel, would not God condemn him Because therefore he built a temple for God he showed that he worshipped God. And of what did he build? Of wood and stone, because God deigned to make unto Himself by His servant an house on earth, where He might be asked, where He might be had in mind.

For the flesh lusts after nothing save through the soul, but the flesh is said to lust against the spirit, when the soul with fleshly lust wrestles against the spirit. This whole are we: and the flesh itself, which on the departure of the soul dies, the lowest part of us is not put away as what we are to flee from, but is laid aside as what we are to receive again, and, after having received it, never again to leave. But \"there is sown an animal body, there shall rise again a spiritual body.\"[fn-36-P3656_1726072:64-nf] Then from that time the flesh will not lust after any thing against the spirit, when as itself also shall be called spiritual, forasmuch as not only without any opposition, but also without any need of bodily aliment, it shall be for ever made subject unto the spirit, to be quickened by Christ. Therefore these two things, which are now opposed the one to the other within us, since we exist in both, let us pray and endeavor that they may agree. For we ought not to think the one of them an enemy, but the fault, whereby the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and this, when healed, will itself cease to exist, and either substance will be safe, and no strife between either. Let us hear the Apostle; \"I know,\" saith he, \"that there dwelleth not in me, that is, in my flesh, any good.\"[fn-36-P3657_1726880:65-nf] This certainly he saith; that the fault of the flesh, in a good thing, is not good; and, when this shall have ceased to exist, it will be flesh, but it will not be now corrupted or faulty[fn-36-P3658_1727087:66-nf] flesh. And yet that this pertains to our nature the same teacher shows, by saying, first, \"I know that there dwelleth not in me,\" in order to expound which, he added, \"that is, in my flesh, any good.\" Therefore he saith that his flesh is himself. It is not then itself that is our enemy: and when its faults are resisted, itself is loved, because itself is cared for; \"For no one ever hated his own flesh,\"[fn-36-P3659_1727521:67-nf] as the Apostle himself saith.

The heaven also, with all things which are contained in heaven, will cease even as it began. The nourishment of the seas by the sweet waters of the springs shall pass away into the power of fire.[fn-57-P5740_922666:108-nf] The Stoics have a constant belief that, the moisture being dried up, all this world will take fire; and the Epicureans have the very same opinion concerning the conflagration of the elements and the destruction of the world. Plato speaks, saying that parts of the world are now inundated, and are now burnt up by alternate changes; and although he says that the world itself is constructed perpetual and indissoluble, yet he adds that to God Himself, the only artificer,[fn-57-P5741_923226:109-nf] it is both dissoluble and mortal. Thus it is no wonder if that mass be destroyed by Him by whom it was reared. You observe that philosophers dispute of the same things that we are saying, not that we are following up their tracks, but that they, from the divine announcements of the prophets, imitated the shadow of the corrupted truth. Thus also the most illustrious of the wise men, Pythagoras first, and Plato chiefly, have delivered the doctrine of resurrection with a corrupt and divided faith; for they will have it, that the bodies being dissolved, the souls alone both abide for ever, and very often pass into other new bodies. To these things they add also this, by way of misrepresenting the truth, that the souls of men return into cattle, birds, and beasts. Assuredly such an opinion as that is not worthy of a philosopher's inquiry, but of the ribaldry of a buffoon.[fn-57-P5742_924163:110-nf] But for our argument it is sufficient, that even in this your wise men do in some measure harmonize with us. But who is so foolish or so brutish as to dare to deny that man, as he could first of all be formed by God, so can again be re-formed; that he is nothing after death, and that he was nothing before he began to exist; and as from nothing it was possible for him to be born, so from nothing it may be possible for him to be restored? Moreover, it is more difficult to begin that which is not, than to repeat that which has been. Do you think that, if anything is withdrawn from our feeble eyes, it perishes to God? Every body, whether it is dried up into dust, or is dissolved into moisture, or is compressed into ashes, or is attenuated into smoke, is withdrawn from us, but it is reserved for God in the custody of the elements. Nor, as you believe, do we fear any loss from sepulture,[fn-57-P5743_925125:111-nf] but we adopt the ancient and better custom of burying in the earth. See, therefore, how for our consolation all nature suggests a future resurrection. The sun sinks down and arises, the stars pass away and return, the flowers die and revive again, after their win-try decay the shrubs resume their leaves, seeds do not flourish again. unless they are rotted:[fn-57-P5744_925511:112-nf] thus the body in the sepulchre is like the trees which in winter hide their verdure with a deceptive dryness. Why are you in haste for it to revive and return, while the winter is still raw? We must wait also for the spring-time of the body. And I am not ignorant that many, in the consciousness of what they deserve, rather desire than believe that they shall be nothing after death; for they would prefer to be altogether extinguished, rather than to be restored for the purpose of punishment. And their error also is enhanced, both by the liberty granted them in this life, and by God's very great patience, whose judgment, the more tardy it is, is so much the more just.

Let him, then, boldly maintain at this rate that He does not give us flesh, on the ground that our flesh derives its original from our parents.

For they who receive the Holy Ghost despise earthly things in their love of heavenly things. None of these opinions, however, is contrary to the faith, whether one regards the two terms, breath and spirit, to pertain to human nature, or both of them to the Holy Ghost, or one of them, breath, to the soul, and the other, spirit, to the Holy Ghost.

But let him say, I indeed am not better than Abraham, but the chastity of the unmarried is better than the chastity of marriage; whereof Abraham had one in use, both in habit. For he lived chastely in the marriage state: but it was in his power to be chaste without marriage, but at chat time it behoved not. But I with more ease use not marriage, which Abraham used, than so use marriage as Abraham used it: and therefore I am better than those, who through incontinence of mind cannot do what I do; not than those, who, on account of difference of time, did not do what I do. For what I now do, they would have done better, if it had been to be done at that time; but what they did, I should not so do, although it were now to be done.

Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, \"For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,\"[fn-75-P7575_2170616:404-nf] we can see at once[fn-75-P7576_2170661:405-nf] from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following promise to Christ: \"Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.\"[fn-75-P7577_2170998:406-nf] It is necessary for me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that they sustain my view. Now they say that this Psalm[fn-75-P7578_2171199:407-nf] was a chant in honour of Hezekiah,[fn-75-P7579_2171249:408-nf] because \"he went up to the house of the Lord,\"[fn-75-P7580_2171326:409-nf] and God turned back and removed his enemies. Therefore, (as they further hold, ) those other words, \"Before the morning star did I beget thee from the womb,\"[fn-75-P7581_2171627:410-nf] are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God have said, \"I have begotten Thee,\" except to His true Son. For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to say which side has the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed. Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down.

For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ.

For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to say which side has the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed. Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, \"For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,\"[fn-75-P7575_2170616:404-nf] we can see at once[fn-75-P7576_2170661:405-nf] from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following promise to Christ: \"Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.\"[fn-75-P7577_2170998:406-nf] It is necessary for me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that they sustain my view. Now they say that this Psalm[fn-75-P7578_2171199:407-nf] was a chant in honour of Hezekiah,[fn-75-P7579_2171249:408-nf] because \"he went up to the house of the Lord,\"[fn-75-P7580_2171326:409-nf] and God turned back and removed his enemies. Therefore, (as they further hold, ) those other words, \"Before the morning star did I beget thee from the womb,\"[fn-75-P7581_2171627:410-nf] are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God have said, \"I have begotten Thee,\" except to His true Son. For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.) The Februarian lustrations[fn-76-P7612_2180099:438-nf] will perhaps[fn-76-P7613_2181471:439-nf] answer him (quite as well), by praying for the dead.[fn-76-P7614_2181541:440-nf] Do not then suppose that the apostle here indicates some new god as the author and advocate of this (baptism for the dead. His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":38,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":42,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":45,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":49,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":52,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":50,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":55,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation?

For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom.

God would be unjust, if any one were not punished or else rewarded in that very condition,[fn-77-P7753_2215058:573-nf] wherein the merit was itself achieved. \"If therefore any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old; things are passed away; behold, all things are become new; \"[fn-77-P7754_2215260:574-nf] and so is accomplished the prophecy of Isaiah.[fn-77-P7755_2215328:575-nf] When also he (in a later passage) enjoins us \"to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and blood\"[fn-77-P7756_2215458:576-nf] (since this substance enters not the kingdom of Gods[fn-77-P7757_2215548:577-nf] ); when, again, he \"espouses the church as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-77-P7758_2215641:578-nf] a spouse to a spouse in very deed,[fn-77-P7759_2215697:579-nf] an image cannot be combined and compared with what is opposed to the real nature the thing (with which it is compared). when he designates \"false apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves\" into likenesses of himself,[fn-77-P7760_2215957:580-nf] of course by their hypocrisy, he charges them with the guilt of disorderly conversation, rather than of false doctrine.[fn-77-P7761_2216099:581-nf] The contrariety, therefore, was one of conduct, not of gods.[fn-77-P7762_2216195:582-nf] If \"Satan himself, too, is transformed into an angel of light,\"[fn-77-P7763_2216412:583-nf] such an assertion must not be used to the prejudice of the Creator. The Creator is not an angel, but God. Into a god of light, and not an angel of light, must Satan then have been said to be transformed, if he did not mean to call him \"the angel,\" which both we and Marcion know him to be. On Paradise is the title of a treatise of ours, in which is discussed all that the subject admits of.[fn-77-P7764_2216826:584-nf] I shall here simply wonder, in connection with this matter, whether a god who has no dispensation of any kind on earth could possibly have a paradise to call his own-without perchance availing himself of the paradise of the Creator, to use it as he does His world-much in the character of a mendicant.[fn-77-P7765_2217237:585-nf] And yet of the removal of a man from earth to heaven we have an instance afforded us by the Creator in Elijah.[fn-77-P7766_2217489:586-nf] But what will excite my surprise still more is the case (next supposed by Marcion), that a God so good and gracious, and so averse to blows and cruelty, should have suborned the angel Satan-not his own either, but the Creator's-\"to buffet\" the apostle,[fn-77-P7767_2217765:587-nf] and then to have refused his request, when thrice entreated to liberate him! It would seem, therefore, that Marcion's god imitates the Creator's conduct, who is an enemy to the proud, even \"putting down the mighty from their seats.\"[fn-77-P7768_2218023:588-nf] Is he then the same God as He who gave Satan power over the person of Job that his \"strength might be made perfect in weakness? \"[fn-77-P7769_2218204:589-nf] How is it that the censurer of the Galatians[fn-77-P7770_2218285:590-nf] still retains the very formula of the law: \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established? \"[fn-77-P7771_2218423:591-nf] How again is it that he threatens sinners \"that he will not spare\" them[fn-77-P7772_2218518:592-nf] -he, the preacher of a most gentle god? Yea, he even declares that \"the Lord hath given to him the power of using sharpness in their presence!\"[fn-77-P7773_2218685:593-nf] Deny now, O heretic, (at your cost, ) that your god is an object to be feared, when his apostle was for making himself so formidable!","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":50,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the Father \"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-78-P7832_2232206:646-nf] it must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom. For he in a previous verse ascribed sin to the flesh, and made it out to be \"the law of sin dwelling in his members,\" and \"warring against the law of the mind.\"[fn-78-P7833_2232476:647-nf] On this account, therefore, (does he mean to say that) the Son was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might redeem this sinful flesh by a like substance, even a fleshly one, which bare a resemblance to sinful flesh, although it was itself free from sin. Now this will be the very perfection of divine power to effect the salvation (of man) in a nature like his own,[fn-78-P7834_2232890:648-nf] For it would be no great matter if the Spirit of God remedied the flesh; but when a flesh, which is the very copy[fn-78-P7835_2233017:649-nf] of the sinning substance-itself flesh also-only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a great thing). The likeness, therefore, will have reference to the quality[fn-78-P7836_2233215:650-nf] of the sinfulness, and not to any falsity[fn-78-P7837_2233273:651-nf] of the substance. Because he would not have added the attribute \"sinful,\"[fn-78-P7838_2233365:652-nf] if he meant the \"likeness\" to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case he would only have used the word \"flesh,\" and omitted the \"sinful.\" But inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said \"sinful flesh,\" (or \"flesh of sin,\")[fn-78-P7839_2234360:653-nf] he has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose[fn-78-P7840_2234533:654-nf] that the likeness was predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition[fn-78-P7841_2234765:655-nf] with our own; but true still, as being of a nature[fn-78-P7842_2234831:656-nf] not really unlike ours.[fn-78-P7843_2235083:657-nf] And again, in contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness. The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he would not have us \"live in the flesh,\" although in the flesh-even by not living in the works of the flesh[fn-78-P7846_2236549:660-nf] -he shows that when he wrote the words, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-78-P7847_2236670:661-nf] it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,[fn-78-P7848_2236925:662-nf] not on the substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if \"the body indeed is dead because of sin\" (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the body), \"but the spirit is life because of righteousness,\"[fn-78-P7849_2237246:663-nf] it follows that this life accrues to that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the body[fn-78-P7850_2237401:664-nf] is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: \"He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\"[fn-78-P7851_2237664:665-nf] In these words he both affirmed the resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called[fn-78-P7852_2237793:666-nf] body, nor can anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God. So says the Creator's Psalmist: \"It is better to hope in the Lord, than to hope even in princes.\"[fn-78-P7870_2243623:684-nf] \"Patient in tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7871_2243671:685-nf] You have (this in) the Psalm: \"The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7872_2243770:686-nf] \"Bless, and curse not,\"[fn-78-P7873_2243812:687-nf] (says your apostle.) But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things, and blessed them? \"Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\"[fn-78-P7874_2244046:688-nf] For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces a woe.[fn-78-P7875_2244123:689-nf] \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\"[fn-78-P7876_2244180:690-nf] (Like unto which is the Creator's precept: ) \"Thou shalt not remember thy brother's evil against thee.\"[fn-78-P7877_2244305:691-nf] (Again: ) \"Avenge not yourselves; \"[fn-78-P7878_2244366:692-nf] for it is written, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"[fn-78-P7879_2244457:693-nf] \"Live peaceably with all men.\"[fn-78-P7880_2244538:694-nf] The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense. Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion's god (after all).[fn-78-P7882_2245034:696-nf] If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator's Christ, what is the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it? \"[fn-78-P7883_2245389:697-nf] In vain has (our man of) Pontus laboured to deny this statement.[fn-78-P7884_2245474:698-nf] If the gospel has not fulfilled the law, then all I can say is,[fn-78-P7885_2245698:699-nf] the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":41,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When (the apostle) mentions the several motives of those who were preaching the gospel, how that some, \"waxing confident by his bonds, were more fearless in speaking the word,\" while others \"preached Christ even out of envy and strife, and again others out of good-will\" many also \"out of love,\" and certain \"out of contention,\" and some \"in rivalry to himself,\"[fn-81-P8108_2304056:904-nf] he had a favourable opportunity, no doubt,[fn-81-P8109_2304122:905-nf] of taxing what they preached with a diversity of doctrine, as if it were no less than this which caused so great a variance in their tempers. But while he exposes these tempers as the sole cause of the diversity, he avoids inculpating the regular mysteries of the faith,[fn-81-P8110_2304408:906-nf] and affirms that there is, notwithstanding, but one Christ and His one God, whatever motives men had in preaching Him. Therefore, says he, it matters not to me \"whether it be in pretence or in truth that Christ is preached,\"[fn-81-P8111_2304663:907-nf] because one Christ alone was announced, whether in their \"pretentious\" or their \"truthful\" faith. For it was to the faithfulness of their preaching that he applied the word truth, not to the rightness of the rule itself, because there was indeed but one rule; whereas the conduct of the preachers varied: in some of them it was true, i. e. single-minded, while in others it was sophisticated with over-much learning. This being the case, it is manifest that that Christ was the subject of their preaching who was always the theme of the prophets. Now, if it were a completely different Christ that was being introduced by the apostle, the novelty of the thing would have produced a diversity (in belief.). For there would not have been wanting, in spite of the novel teaching,[fn-81-P8112_2305460:908-nf] men to interpret the preached gospel of the Creator's Christ, since the majority of persons everywhere now-a-days are of our way of thinking, rather than on the heretical side. So that the apostle would not in such a passage as the present one have refrained from remarking and censuring the diversity. Since, however, there is no blame of a diversity, there is no proof of a novelty. Of course[fn-81-P8113_2305875:909-nf] the Marcionites suppose that they have the apostle on their side in the following passage in the matter of Christ's substance-that in Him there was nothing but a phantom of flesh. For he says of Christ, that, \"being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God;[fn-81-P8114_2306173:910-nf] but emptied[fn-81-P8115_2306249:911-nf] Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant,\" not the reality, \"and was made in the likeness of man,\" not a man, \"and was found in fashion as a man,\"[fn-81-P8116_2306431:912-nf] not in his substance, that is to say, his flesh; just as if to a substance there did not accrue both form and likeness and fashion. It is well for us that in another passage (the apostle) calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-81-P8117_2306690:913-nf] For will it not follow with equal force from that passage, that Christ is not truly God, because the apostle places Him in the image of God, if, (as Marcion contends, ) He is not truly man because of His having taken on Him the form or image of a man? For in both cases the true substance will have to be excluded, if image (or \"fashion\") and likeness and form shall be claimed for a phantom. But since he is truly God, as the Son of the Father, in His fashion and image, He has been already by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, \"found in the fashion \"and image\" of a man.\" For when he propounded[fn-81-P8118_2307348:914-nf] Him as thus \"found\" in the manner[fn-81-P8119_2307397:915-nf] of a man, he in fact affirmed Him to be most certainly human. For what is found, manifestly possesses existence. Therefore, as He was found to be God by His mighty power, so was He found to be man by reason of His flesh, because the apostle could not have pronounced Him to have \"become obedient unto death,\"[fn-81-P8120_2307731:916-nf] if He had not been constituted of a mortal substance. Still more plainly does this appear from the apostle's additional words, \"even the death of the cross.\"[fn-81-P8121_2307909:917-nf] For he could hardly mean this to be a climax[fn-81-P8122_2307974:918-nf] to the human suffering, to extol the virtue[fn-81-P8123_2308047:919-nf] of His obedience, if he had known it all to be the imaginary process of a phantom, which rather eluded the cross than experienced it, and which displayed no virtue[fn-81-P8124_2308247:920-nf] in the suffering, but only illusion. But \"those things which he had once accounted gain,\" and which he enumerates in the preceding verse-\"trust in the flesh,\" the sign of \"circumcision,\" his origin as \"an Hebrew of the Hebrews,\" his descent from \"the tribe of Benjamin,\" his dignity in the honours of the Pharisee[fn-81-P8125_2308592:921-nf] -he now reckons to be only \"loss\" to himself;[fn-81-P8126_2308686:922-nf] (in other words, ) it was not the God of the Jews, but their stupid obduracy, which he repudiates. These are also the things \"which he counts but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ\"[fn-81-P8127_2308905:923-nf] (but by no means for the rejection of God the Creator); \"whilst he has not his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" i.e. Christ, \"the righteousness which is of God.\"[fn-81-P8128_2309127:924-nf] Then, say you, according to this distinction the law did not proceed from the God of Christ. Subtle enough! But here is something still more subtle for you. For when (the apostle) says, \"Not (the righteousness) which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" he would not have used the phrase through Him of any other than Him to whom the law belonged. \"Our conversation,\" says he, \"is in heaven.\"[fn-81-P8129_2309551:925-nf] I here recognise the Creator's ancient promise to Abraham: \"I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven.\"[fn-81-P8130_2309683:926-nf] Therefore \"one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-81-P8131_2309764:927-nf] If, again, Christ in His advent from heaven \"shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body,\"[fn-81-P8132_2309928:928-nf] it follows that this body of ours shall rise again, which is now in a state of humiliation in its sufferings and according to the law of mortality drops into the ground. But how shall it be changed, if it shall have no real existence? If, however, this is only said of those who shall be found in the flesh[fn-81-P8133_2310368:929-nf] at the advent of God, and who shall have to be changed,\"[fn-81-P8134_2310451:930-nf] what shall they do who will rise first? They will have no substance from which to undergo a change. But he says (elsewhere), \"We shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord (in the air).\"[fn-81-P8135_2310824:931-nf] Then, if we are to be caught up alone with them, surely we shall likewise be changed together with them.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":51,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When (the apostle) mentions the several motives of those who were preaching the gospel, how that some, \"waxing confident by his bonds, were more fearless in speaking the word,\" while others \"preached Christ even out of envy and strife, and again others out of good-will\" many also \"out of love,\" and certain \"out of contention,\" and some \"in rivalry to himself,\"[fn-81-P8108_2304056:904-nf] he had a favourable opportunity, no doubt,[fn-81-P8109_2304122:905-nf] of taxing what they preached with a diversity of doctrine, as if it were no less than this which caused so great a variance in their tempers.

For he says of Christ, that, \"being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God;[fn-81-P8114_2306173:910-nf] but emptied[fn-81-P8115_2306249:911-nf] Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant,\" not the reality, \"and was made in the likeness of man,\" not a man, \"and was found in fashion as a man,\"[fn-81-P8116_2306431:912-nf] not in his substance, that is to say, his flesh; just as if to a substance there did not accrue both form and likeness and fashion. It is well for us that in another passage (the apostle) calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-81-P8117_2306690:913-nf] For will it not follow with equal force from that passage, that Christ is not truly God, because the apostle places Him in the image of God, if, (as Marcion contends, ) He is not truly man because of His having taken on Him the form or image of a man? For in both cases the true substance will have to be excluded, if image (or \"fashion\") and likeness and form shall be claimed for a phantom. But since he is truly God, as the Son of the Father, in His fashion and image, He has been already by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, \"found in the fashion \"and image\" of a man.\" For when he propounded[fn-81-P8118_2307348:914-nf] Him as thus \"found\" in the manner[fn-81-P8119_2307397:915-nf] of a man, he in fact affirmed Him to be most certainly human. For what is found, manifestly possesses existence. Therefore, as He was found to be God by His mighty power, so was He found to be man by reason of His flesh, because the apostle could not have pronounced Him to have \"become obedient unto death,\"[fn-81-P8120_2307731:916-nf] if He had not been constituted of a mortal substance. Still more plainly does this appear from the apostle's additional words, \"even the death of the cross.\"[fn-81-P8121_2307909:917-nf] For he could hardly mean this to be a climax[fn-81-P8122_2307974:918-nf] to the human suffering, to extol the virtue[fn-81-P8123_2308047:919-nf] of His obedience, if he had known it all to be the imaginary process of a phantom, which rather eluded the cross than experienced it, and which displayed no virtue[fn-81-P8124_2308247:920-nf] in the suffering, but only illusion. But \"those things which he had once accounted gain,\" and which he enumerates in the preceding verse-\"trust in the flesh,\" the sign of \"circumcision,\" his origin as \"an Hebrew of the Hebrews,\" his descent from \"the tribe of Benjamin,\" his dignity in the honours of the Pharisee[fn-81-P8125_2308592:921-nf] -he now reckons to be only \"loss\" to himself;[fn-81-P8126_2308686:922-nf] (in other words, ) it was not the God of the Jews, but their stupid obduracy, which he repudiates. These are also the things \"which he counts but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ\"[fn-81-P8127_2308905:923-nf] (but by no means for the rejection of God the Creator); \"whilst he has not his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" i.e. Christ, \"the righteousness which is of God.\"[fn-81-P8128_2309127:924-nf] Then, say you, according to this distinction the law did not proceed from the God of Christ. Subtle enough! But here is something still more subtle for you. For when (the apostle) says, \"Not (the righteousness) which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" he would not have used the phrase through Him of any other than Him to whom the law belonged. \"Our conversation,\" says he, \"is in heaven.\"[fn-81-P8129_2309551:925-nf] I here recognise the Creator's ancient promise to Abraham: \"I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven.\"[fn-81-P8130_2309683:926-nf] Therefore \"one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-81-P8131_2309764:927-nf] If, again, Christ in His advent from heaven \"shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body,\"[fn-81-P8132_2309928:928-nf] it follows that this body of ours shall rise again, which is now in a state of humiliation in its sufferings and according to the law of mortality drops into the ground. But how shall it be changed, if it shall have no real existence? If, however, this is only said of those who shall be found in the flesh[fn-81-P8133_2310368:929-nf] at the advent of God, and who shall have to be changed,\"[fn-81-P8134_2310451:930-nf] what shall they do who will rise first? They will have no substance from which to undergo a change. But he says (elsewhere), \"We shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord (in the air).\"[fn-81-P8135_2310824:931-nf] Then, if we are to be caught up alone with them, surely we shall likewise be changed together with them.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"126","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"49. There are also valid processes of reasoning which lead to false conclusions, by following out to its logical consequences the error of the man with whom one is arguing; and these conclusions are sometimes drawn by a good and learned man, with the object of making the person from whose error these consequences result, feel ashamed of them and of thus leading him to give up his error when he finds that if he wishes to retain his old opinion, he must of necessity also hold other opinions which he condemns. For example, the apostle did not draw true conclusions when he said, \"Then is Christ not risen,\" and again, \"Then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain;\"[fn-49-P4989_2690201:63-nf] and further on drew other inferences which are all utterly false; for Christ has risen, the preaching of those who declared this fact was not in vain, nor was their faith in vain who had believed it. But all these false inferences followed legitimately from the opinion of those who said that there is no resurrection of the dead. These inferences, then, being repudiated as false, it follows that since they would be true if the dead rise not, there will be a resurrection of the dead.

It is, therefore, the present necessity that we are to avoid, but yet such as is a hindrance to somewhat of the good things to come; by which necessity the married life is forced to have thought of the things of the world, how to please, the husband the wife or the wife the husband. Not that these separate from the kingdom of God, as there are sins, which are restrained by command, not by counsel, on this account, because it is matter of condemnation not to obey the Lord when He commands: but that, which, within the kingdom of God itself, might be more largely possessed, if there were larger thoughts how they were to please God, will assuredly be less, when as this very thing is less thought of by necessity of marriage.

Wherefore, because it is not sin to marry a wife or to be married, (but if it were a sin, it would be forbidden by a \"Commands\") on this account there is no \"Command\" of the Lord concerning virgins. But since, after we have shunned or had forgiveness of sins, we must approach eternal life, wherein is a certain or more excellent glory, to be assigned not unto all who shall live for ever, but unto certain there; in order to obtain which it is not enough to have been set free from sins, unless there be vowed unto Him, Who setteth us free, something, which it is no matter of fault not to have vowed, but matter of praise to have vowed and performed; he saith, \"I give counsel, as having obtained mercy from God that I should be faithful.\" For neither ought I to grudge faithful counsel, who not by my own merits, but by the mercy of God, am faithful. \"I think therefore that this is good, by reason of the present necessity.\"[fn-39-P3910_1859030:24-nf] This, saith he, on which I have not command of the Lord, but give counsel, that is concerning virgins, I think to be good by reason of the present necessity.

And therefore the apostle answers, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.\"[fn-58-P5898_1793465:98-nf] But the corruptible and mortal putting on incorruption and immortality, what else is this, but that which is sown in corruption rising in incorruption?[fn-58-P5899_1793637:99-nf] For, \"as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.\"[fn-59-P5900_1793754:100-nf] For the \"image of the earthly\" which we have borne refers to the saying, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\"[fn-59-P5901_1793899:101-nf] And the \"image of the heavenly is the resurrection from the dead and incorruption.\"","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":15,"verse":50,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_122_from_the_discourse_on_the_resurrection_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-06","text":"VI.

Now if the translator had chosen to say, propterea consolationem habuimus fratres in vobis, he would have followed the words less literally, but there would have been less doubt about the meaning; or, indeed, if he had added nostri, hardly any one would have doubted that the vocative case was meant when he heard propterea consolati sumus fratres nostri in vobis.

Remember then, that Jechonias, rejected without any fault of his, ceased to reign, and passed over unto the Gentiles, when the carrying away unto Babylon took place. Now observe the figure hereby manifested beforehand, of things to come in the Lord Jesus Christ. For the Jews would not that our Lord Jesus Christ should reign over them, yet found they no fault in Him. He was rejected in His own person, and in that of His servants also, and so they passed over unto the Gentiles as into Babylon in a figure. For this also did Jeremiah prophesy, that the Lord commanded them to go into Babylon: and whatever other prophets told the people not to go into Babylon, them he reproved as false prophets.[fn-29-P2944_1302934:37-nf] Let those who read the Scriptures, remember this as we do; and let those who do not, give us credit. Jeremiah then on the part of God threatened those who would not go into Babylon, whereas to them who should go he promised rest there, and a sort of happiness in the cultivation of their vines, and planting of their gardens, and the abundance of their fruits. How then does the people of Israel, not now in figure but in verity, pass over unto Babylon? Whence came the Apostles? Were they not of the nation of the Jews?

For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.\"[fn-29-P2951_1304904:44-nf] For they were not yet Christian kings, yet he prayed for them.

Whoever, then, denies that our body and its members, which the apostle so approves and extols, are the handiwork of God, you see whom he contradicts, preaching contrary to what you have received. So, instead of refuting his opinions, I may leave him to be accursed of all Christians. The apostle says, God tempered the body. Faustus says, Not God, but Hyle. Anathemas are more suitable than arguments to such contradictions. You cannot say that God is here called the God of this world. And if any one understands the passage where this expression does occur to mean that the devil blinds the minds of unbelievers, we grant that he does so by his evil suggestions, from yielding to which, men lose the light of righteousness in God's righteous retribution. This is all in accordance with sacred Scripture. The apostle himself speaks of temptation from without: \"I fear lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and purity. that is in Christ.\"[fn-19-P1994_1165246:14-nf] To the same purpose are the words. \"Evil communications corrupt good manners;\"[fn-19-P1995_1165344:15-nf] and when he speaks of a man deceiving himself, \"Whoever thinketh himself to be anything, when he is nothing, deceiveth himself;\"[fn-19-P1996_1165493:16-nf] or again, in the passage already quoted of the judgment of God, \"God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.\"[fn-19-P1997_1165661:17-nf] Similarly, in the Old Testament, after the words, \"God did not create death, nor hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living,\" we read, \"By the envy of the devil death entered into the world.\"[fn-19-P1998_1165877:18-nf] And again of death, that men may not put the blame from themselves, \"The wicked invite her with hands and voice; and thinking her a friend, they are drawn down.\"[fn-19-P1999_1166069:19-nf] Elsewhere. however, it is said, \"Good and evil, life and death, riches and poverty, are from the Lord God.\"[fn-20-P2000_1166195:20-nf] This seems perplexing to people who do not understand that, apart from the manifest judgment to follow hereafter upon every evil work, there is an actual judgment at the time; so that in one action, besides the craft of the deceiver and the wickedness of the voluntary agent, there is also the just penalty of the judge: for while the devil suggests, and man consents, God abandons. So, if you join the words, God of this world, and understand that the devil blinds unbelievers by his mischievous delusions, the meaning is not a bad one. For the word God is not used by itself, but with the qualification of this world, that is, of wicked men, who seek to prosper only in this age. In this sense the world is also called evil, where it is written, \"that He might deliver us from this present evil age.\"[fn-20-P2001_1167018:21-nf] In the same way, in the expression, \"whose god is their belly,\" it is only in connection with the word whose that the belly is called god. So also, in the Psalms, the devils would not be called gods without adding \"of the nations.\"[fn-20-P2002_1167266:22-nf] But in the passage we are now considering it is not said, The god of this world, or, Whose god is their belly, or, The gods of the nations are devils; but simply, God has tempered the body, which can be understood only of the true God, the Creator of all. There is no disparaging addition here, as in the other cases. But perhaps Faustus will say that God tempered the body, not as the maker of it, in the arrangement of its members, but by mixing His light with it. Thus Faustus would attribute to some other being than God the construction of the body, and the arrangement of its members, while God tempered the evil of the construction by the mixture of His goodness. Such are the inventions with which the Manichaeans cram feeble minds. But God, in aid of the feeble, by the mouth of the sacred writers rebukes this opinion. For we read a few verses before: \"God has placed the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased Him.\" Evidently, God is said to have tempered the body, because He has constructed it of many members, which in their union preserve the variety of their respective functions.","title":"Book XXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_34_book_iv_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And now, as far as the Lord vouchsafes to enable me, I must reply also to that allegation of yours, in which, speaking of the soul, you again mention my name, and say, \"We do not, as the very able and learned bishop Augustin professes, allow it to be incorporeal and also a spirit.\" We have therefore, first, to discuss the question, whether the soul is to be deemed incorporeal, as I have said; or corporeal, as you hold.

But since Apelles' precious set[fn-93-P9382_2580215:118-nf] lay a very great stress on the shameful condition[fn-93-P9383_2580289:119-nf] of the flesh, which they will have to have been furnished with souls tampered with by the fiery author of evil,[fn-93-P9384_2580419:120-nf] and so unworthy of Christ; and because they on that account suppose that a sidereal substance is suitable for Him, I am bound to refute them on their own ground. They mention a certain angel of great renown as having created this world of ours, and as having, after the creation, repented of his work. This indeed we have treated of in a passage by itself; for we have written a little work in opposition to them, on the question whether one who had the spirit, and will, and power of Christ for such operations, could have done anything which required repentance, since they describe the said angel by the figure of \"the lost sheep.\" The world, then, must be a wrong thing,[fn-93-P9385_2581208:121-nf] according to the evidence of its Creator's repentance; for all repentance is the admission of fault, nor has it indeed any existence except through fault. Now, if the world[fn-93-P9386_2581398:122-nf] is a fault, as is the body, such must be its parts-faulty too; so in like manner must be the heaven and its celestial (contents), and everything which is conceived and produced out of it. And \"a corrupt tree must needs bring forth evil fruit.\"[fn-93-P9387_2581697:123-nf] The flesh of Christ, therefore, if composed of celestial elements, consists of faulty materials, sinful by reason of its sinful origin;[fn-93-P9388_2581855:124-nf] so that it must be a part of that substance which they disdain to clothe Christ with, because of its sinfulness,-in other words, our own. Then, as there is no difference in the point of ignominy, let them either devise for Christ some substance of a purer stamp, since they are displeased with our own, or else let them recognise this too, than which even a heavenly substance could not have been better. We read in so many words:[fn-93-P9389_2582300:125-nf] \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-93-P9390_2582395:126-nf] This passage, however, has nothing to do with any difference of substance; it only contrasts with the once[fn-93-P9391_2582524:127-nf] \"earthy\" substance of the flesh of the first man, Adam, the \"heavenly\" substance of the spirit of the second man, Christ. And so entirely does the passage refer the celestial man to the spirit and not to the flesh, that those whom it compares to Him evidently become celestial-by the Spirit, of course-even in this \"earthy flesh.\" Now, since Christ is heavenly even in regard to the flesh, they could not be compared to Him, who are not heavenly in reference to their flesh.[fn-93-P9392_2583013:128-nf] If, then, they who become heavenly, as Christ also was, carry about an \"earthy\" substance of flesh, the conclusion which is affirmed by this fact is, that Christ Himself also was heavenly, but in an \"earthy\" flesh, even as they are who are put on a level with Him.[fn-93-P9393_2583302:129-nf] ","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":54,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"On the careful consideration of these things, and things of the same kind in the context of that apostolical Scripture, the apostle is rightly understood to have signified not, indeed, himself alone in his own person, but others also established under grace, and with him not yet established in that perfect peace in which death shall be swallowed up in victory.[fn-51-P5157_2025570:60-nf] And concerning this he afterwards says, \"But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.

Well may the person who says this arm himself against Holy Scripture's most manifest proclamations, with counsel of outrageous impiety, and persevere in a tortuous path, and essay to bring in a pestiferous doctrine that not \"Blessed is the man who hath notwalked in the counsel of the ungodly, and in the way of sinners hath not stood, and in thechair of noisome wickedness[fn-47-P4706_2322081:141-nf] hath not sat.[fn-47-P4707_2322117:142-nf] For if he would meditate in God's law day and night, there he should find the Apostle Paul himself, who assuredly professing highest chastity saith, \"I would that all men were even as I:\" and yet shows himself a man, not only in so being, but also in so speaking.

Then let them not deny themselves to be men, just because in respect of their masculine sex they work not. For wedded Christians also who do this work, are of course not Christians on the score of that which they have in common with the rest who are not Christians and with the very cattle. For that is one thing that is either to infirmity conceded or to mortal propagation paid as a debt, but another that which for the laying hold of incorrupt and eternal life is by faithful profession signified. That then which concerning not veiling of the head is enjoined to men, in the body indeed it is set forth in a figure, but that it is enacted in the mind, wherein is the image and glory of God, the words themselves do indicate: \"A man indeed,\" it saith, \"ought not to veil his head, forsomuch as he is the image and glory of God.\" For where this image is, he doth himself declare, where he saith, \"Lie not one to another; but stripping off the old man with his deeds, put ye on the new, which is renewed to the acknowledging of God, according to the image of Him who created him.\"[fn-47-P4712_2324927:147-nf] Who can doubt that this renewing takes place in the mind? But and if any doubt, let him hear a more open sentence. For, giving the same admonition, he thus saith in another place: \"As is the truth in Jesus, that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, him which is corrupt according to the lust of deception; but be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, him which after God is created.\"[fn-47-P4713_2325382:148-nf] What then?

However, it is made in the image of God only as regards the inner, which, besides being immaterial, is rational, and is not possessed by the lower animals. God, then, did not make one man after His own image, and another man not after that image; but the one man, which includes both the inner and the outer, He made after His own image, not as regards the possession of a body and of mortal life, but as regards the rational mind with the power of knowing God, and with the superiority as compared with all irrational creatures which the possession of reason implies. Faustus allows that the inner man is made by God, when, as he says, it is renewed in the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him. I readily admit this on the apostle's authority. Why does not Faustus admit on the same authority that \"God has placed the members every one in the body, as it has pleased Him\"?[fn-23-P2350_1423689:9-nf] Here we learn from the same apostle that God is the framer of the outer man too.

Moreover, in treating of the earthy and the heavenly man, and making the distinction between the mortal and the immortal, between that which we are in Adam and that which we shall be in Christ, the apostle quotes the declaration of the law regarding the earthy or natural body, referring to the very book and the very passage where it is written that God made the earthy man too. Speaking of the manner in which the dead shall rise again, and of the body with which they shall come, after using the similitude of the seeds of corn, that they are sown bare grain, and that God gives them a body as it pleases Him, and to every seed his own body,-thus, by the way, overthrowing the error of the Manichaeans, who say that grains and plants, and all roots and shoots, are created by the race of darkness, and not by God, who, according to them, instead of exerting power in the production of these objects, is Himself subject to confinement in them,-he goes on, after this refutation of Manichaean impieties, to describe the different kinds of flesh. \"All flesh,\" he says, \"is not the same flesh.\" Then he speaks of celestial and terrestrial bodies, and then of the change of our body by which it will become spiritual and heavenly. \"It is sown,\" he says, \"in dishonor, it shall rise in glory; it is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power; it is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body.\" Then, in order to show the origin of the animal body, he says, \"There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body; as it is written, The first man, Adam, was made a living soul.\"[fn-23-P2351_1425513:10-nf] Now this is written in Genesis,[fn-23-P2352_1425568:11-nf] where it is related how God made man, and animated the body which He had formed of the earth. By the old man the apostle simply means the old life, which is a life in sin, and is after the manner of Adam, of whom it is said, \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned.\"[fn-23-P2353_1425928:12-nf] Thus the whole of this man, both the inner and the outer part, has become old because of sin, and liable to the punishment of mortality. There is, however, a restoration of the inner man, when it is renewed after the image of its Creator, in the putting off of unrighteousness-that is, the old man, and putting on righteousness-that is, the new man. But when that which is sown a natural body shall rise a spiritual body, the outer man too shall attain the dignity of a celestial character; so that all that has been created may be created anew, and all that has been made be remade by the Creator and Maker Himself. This is briefly explained in the words: \"The body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.

But elsewhere the apostle teaches that God is the Maker of both; for he says, \"Neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord; for as the woman is of the man, so is the man by the woman; but all things are of God.\"[fn-23-P2355_1427331:14-nf] The only reply given to this, by the perverse stupidity of those who are alienated from the life of God by the ignorance which is in them, on account of the blindness of their heart, is, that whatever pleases them in the apostolic writings is true, and whatever displeases them is false.

And if we then go on to ask when God made what He now renews, they must devise some subterfuge to prevent the exposure of their absurdities. For, according to them, the inner man is not formed or created or originated by God, but is part of His own substance sent against His enemies; and instead of becoming old by sin, it is through necessity captured and damaged by the enemy. Not to repeat all the nonsense they talk, the first man they speak of is not the man of the earth earthy that the apostle speaks of,[fn-23-P2356_1428566:15-nf] but an invention proceeding from their own magazine of untruths.

And if we then go on to ask when God made what He now renews, they must devise some subterfuge to prevent the exposure of their absurdities. For, according to them, the inner man is not formed or created or originated by God, but is part of His own substance sent against His enemies; and instead of becoming old by sin, it is through necessity captured and damaged by the enemy. Not to repeat all the nonsense they talk, the first man they speak of is not the man of the earth earthy that the apostle speaks of,[fn-23-P2356_1428566:15-nf] but an invention proceeding from their own magazine of untruths. Faustus, though he chooses man as a subject for discussion, says not a word of this first man; for he is afraid that his opponents in the discussion might come to know something about him.","title":"Book XXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_22_sermon_v_lv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of our Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.\"[fn-99-P9917_2739886:166-nf] What archangel's voice, (I wonder), what trump of God is now heard, except it be, forsooth, in the entertainments of the heretics? For, allowing that the word of the gospel may be called \"the trump of God,\" since it was still calling men, yet they must at that time either be dead as to the body, that they may be able to rise again; and then how are they alive? Or else caught up into the clouds; and how then are they here? \"Most miserable,\" no doubt, as the apostle declared them, are they \"who in this life only\" shall be found to have hope:[fn-99-P9918_2740459:167-nf] they will have to be excluded while they are with premature haste seizing that which is promised after this life; erring concerning the truth, no less than Phygellus and Hermogenes.[fn-99-P9919_2740663:168-nf] Hence it is that the Holy Ghost, in His greatness, foreseeing clearly all such interpretations as these, suggests (to the apostle), in this very epistle of his to the Thessalonians, as follows: \"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, there is no necessity for my writing unto you. For ye yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, `Peace, 'and `All things are safe, 'then sudden destruction shall come upon them.\"[fn-99-P9920_2741170:169-nf] Again, in the second epistle he addresses them with even greater earnestness: \"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto Him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled, either by spirit, or by word,\" that is, the word of false prophets, \"or by letter,\" that is, the letter of false apostles, \"as if from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come, unless indeed there first come a falling away,\" he means indeed of this present empire, \"and that man of sin be revealed,\" that is to say, Antichrist, \"the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or religion; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, affirming that he is God.

For when he adds, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,\"[fn-100-P10080_2806047:275-nf] this will assuredly be that house from heaven, with which we so earnestly desire to be clothed upon, whilst groaning in this our present body,-meaning, of course, over this flesh in which we shall be surprised at last; because he says that we are burdened whilst in this tabernacle, which we do not wish indeed to be stripped of, but rather to be in it clothed over, in such a way that mortality may be swallowed up of life, that is, by putting on over us whilst we are transformed that vestiture which is from heaven. For who is there that will not desire, while he is in the flesh, to put on immortality, and to continue his life by a happy escape from death, through the transformation which must be experienced instead of it, without encountering too that Hades which will exact the very last farthing?[fn-100-P10081_2806879:276-nf] Notwithstanding, he who has already traversed Hades is destined also to obtain the change after the resurrection. For from this circumstance it is that we definitively declare that the flesh will by all means rise again, and, from the change that is to come over it, will assume the condition of angels. Now, if it were merely in the case of those who shall be found in the flesh that the change must be undergone, in order that mortality may be swallowed up of life-in other words, that the flesh (be covered) with the heavenly and eternal raiment-it would either follow that those who shall be found in death would not obtain life, deprived as they would then be of the material and so to say the aliment of life, that is, the flesh; or else, these also must needs undergo the change, that in them too mortality may be swallowed up of life, since it is appointed that they too should obtain life. But, you say, in the case of the dead, mortality is already swallowed up of life. No, not in all cases, certainly. For how many will most probably be found of men who had just died-so recently put into their graves, that nothing in them would seem to be decayed? For you do not of course deem a thing to be decayed unless it be cut off, abolished, and withdrawn from our perception, as having in every possible way ceased to be apparent. There are the carcases of the giants of old time; it will be obvious enough that they are not absolutely decayed, for their bony frames are still extant. We have already spoken of this elsewhere.[fn-100-P10082_2808514:277-nf] For instance,[fn-100-P10083_2808551:278-nf] even lately in this very city,[fn-100-P10084_2808610:279-nf] when they were sacrilegiously laying the foundations of the Odeum on a good many ancient graves, people were horror-stricken to discover, after some five hundred years, bones, which still retained their moisture, and hair which had not lost its perfume. It is certain not only that bones remain indurated, but also that teeth continue undecayed for ages-both of them the lasting germs of that body which is to sprout into life again in the resurrection. Lastly, even if everything that is mortal in all the dead shall then be found decayed-at any rate consumed by death, by time, and through age,-is there nothing which will be \"swallowed up of life,\"[fn-100-P10085_2809279:280-nf] nor by being covered over and arrayed in the vesture of immortality? Now, he who says that mortality is going to be swallowed up of life has already admitted that what is dead is not destroyed by those other before-mentioned devourers. And verily it will be extremely fit that all shall be consummated and brought about by the operations of God, and not by the laws of nature. Therefore, inasmuch as what is mortal has to be swallowed up of life, it must needs be brought out to view in order to be so swallowed up; (needful) also to be swallowed up, in order to undergo the ultimate transformation. If you were to say that a fire is to be lighted, you could not possibly allege that what is to kindle it is sometimes necessary and sometimes not. In like manner, when he inserts the words \"If so be that being unclothed[fn-100-P10086_2810155:281-nf] we be not found naked.\"[fn-100-P10087_2810299:282-nf] -referring, of course, to those who shall not be found in the day of the Lord alive and in the flesh-he did not say that they whom he had just described as unclothed or stripped, were naked in any other sense than meaning that they should be understood to be reinvested with the very same substance they had been divested of. For although they shall be found naked when their flesh has been laid aside, or to some extent sundered or worn away (and this condition may well be called nakedness, ) they shall afterwards recover it again, in order that, being reinvested with the flesh, they may be able also to have put over that the supervestment of immortality; for it will be impossible for the outside garment to fit except over one who is already dressed.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":55,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"161","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For that must be living after the world, which, as the old man, he declares to be \"crucified with Christ,\"[fn-101-P10139_2827593:319-nf] not as a bodily structure, but as moral behaviour. Besides, if we do not understand it in this sense, it is not our bodily frame which has been transfixed (at all events), nor has our flesh endured the cross of Christ; but the sense is that which he has subjoined, \"that the body of sin might be made void, \"[fn-101-P10140_2827921:320-nf] by an amendment of life, not by a destruction of the substance, as he goes on to say, \"that henceforth we should not serve sin; \"[fn-101-P10141_2828140:321-nf] and that we should believe ourselves to be \"dead with Christ,\" in such a manner as that \"we shall also live with Him.\"[fn-101-P10142_2828376:322-nf] On the same principle he says: \"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed.\"[fn-101-P10143_2828478:323-nf] To what? To the flesh? No, but \"unto sin.\"[fn-101-P10144_2828537:324-nf] Accordingly as to the flesh they will be saved-\" alive unto God in Christ Jesus,\"[fn-101-P10145_2828635:325-nf] through the flesh of course, to which they will not be dead; since it is \"unto sin,\" and not to the flesh, that they are dead. For he pursues the point still further: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it, and that ye should yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield ye yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead \"-not simply alive, but as alive from the dead-\" and your members as instruments of righteousness.\"[fn-101-P10146_2829146:326-nf] And again: \"As ye have yielded your members servants of uncleanness, and of iniquity unto iniquity, even so now yield your members servants of righteousness unto holiness; for whilst ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-101-P10147_2829744:327-nf] Thus throughout this series of passages, whilst withdrawing our members from unrighteousness and sin, and applying them to righteousness and holiness, and transferring the same from the wages of death to the donative of eternal life, he undoubtedly promises to the flesh the recompense of salvation. Now it would not at all have been consistent that any rule of holiness and righteousness should be especially enjoined for the flesh, if the reward of such a discipline were not also within its reach; nor could even baptism be properly ordered for the flesh, if by its regeneration a course were not inaugurated tending to its restitution; the apostle himself suggesting this idea: \"Know ye not, that so many of us as are baptized into Jesus Christ, are baptized into His death? We are therefore buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\"[fn-101-P10148_2830697:328-nf] And that you may not suppose that this is said merely of that life which we have to walk in the newness of, through baptism, by faith, the apostle with superlative forethought adds: \"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of Christ's death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.\"[fn-101-P10149_2831029:329-nf] By a figure we die in our baptism, but in a reality we rise again in the flesh, even as Christ did, \"that, as sin has reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto life eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-101-P10150_2831279:330-nf] But how so, unless equally in the flesh? For where the death is, there too must be the life after the death, because also the life was first there, where the death subsequently was. Now, if the dominion of death operates only in the dissolution of the flesh, in like manner death's contrary, life, ought to produce the contrary effect, even the restoration of the flesh; so that, just as death had swallowed it up in its strength, it also, after this mortal was swallowed up of immortality, may hear the challenge pronounced against it: \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? \"[fn-101-P10151_2831898:331-nf] For in this way \"grace shall there much more abound, where sin once abounded.\"[fn-101-P10152_2831999:332-nf] In this way also \"shall strength be made perfect in weakness,\"[fn-101-P10153_2832081:333-nf] -saving what is lost, reviving what is dead, healing what is stricken, curing what is faint, redeeming what is lost, freeing what is enslaved, recalling what has strayed, raising what is fallen; and this from earth to heaven, where, as the apostle teaches the Philippians, \"we have our citizenship,[fn-101-P10154_2832402:334-nf] from whence also we look for our Saviour Jesus Christ, who shall change our body of humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body\"[fn-101-P10155_2832573:335-nf] -of course after the resurrection, because Christ Himself was not glorified before He suffered. These must be \"the bodies\" which he \"beseeches\" the Romans to \"present\" as \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\"[fn-101-P10156_2832820:336-nf] But how a living sacrifice, if these bodies are to perish? How a holy one, if they are profanely soiled? How acceptable to God, if they are condemned? Come, now, tell me how that passage (in the Epistle) to the Thessalonians-which, because of its clearness, I should suppose to have been written with a sunbeam-is understood by our heretics, who shun the light of Scripture: \"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly.\" And as if this were not plain enough, it goes on to say: \"And may your whole body, and soul, and spirit be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord.\"[fn-101-P10157_2833421:337-nf] Here you have the entire substance of man destined to salvation, and that at no other time than at the coming of the Lord, which is the key of the resurrection.[fn-101-P10158_2833605:338-nf] ","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":50,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":50,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But \"flesh and blood,\" you say, \"cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-101-P10162_2833899:339-nf] We are quite aware that this too is written; but although our opponents place it in the front of the battle, we have intentionally reserved the objection until now, in order that we may in our last assault overthrow it, after we have removed out of the way all the questions which are auxiliary to it. However, they must contrive to recall to their mind even now our preceding arguments, in order that the occasion which originally suggested this passage may assist our judgment in arriving at its meaning. The apostle, as I take it, having set forth for the Corinthians the details of their church discipline, had summed up the substance of his own gospel, and of their belief in an exposition of the Lord's death and resurrection, for the purpose of deducing therefrom the rule of our hope, and the groundwork thereof. Accordingly he subjoins this statement: \"Now if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain, because ye are yet in your sins, and they which have fallen asleep in Christ are perished.\"[fn-101-P10163_2835410:340-nf] Now, what is the point which he evidently labours hard to make us believe throughout this passage? The resurrection of the dead, you say, which was denied: he certainly wished it to be believed on the strength of the example which he adduced-the Lord's resurrection. Certainly, you say. Well now, is an example borrowed from different circumstances, or from like ones? From like ones, by all means, is your answer. How then did Christ rise again? In the flesh, or not? No doubt, since you are told that He \"died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-101-P10164_2835977:341-nf] and \"that He was buried according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-101-P10165_2836046:342-nf] no otherwise than in the flesh, you will also allow that it was in the flesh that He was raised from the dead. For the very same body which fell in death, and which lay in the sepulchre, did also rise again; (and it was) not so much Christ in the flesh, as the flesh in Christ. If, therefore, we are to rise again after the example of Christ, who rose in the flesh, we shall certainly not rise according to that example, unless we also shall ourselves rise again in the flesh. \"For,\" he says, \"since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-101-P10166_2836628:343-nf] (This he says) in order, on the one hand, to distinguish the two authors-Adam of death, Christ of resurrection; and, on the other hand, to make the resurrection operate on the same substance as the death, by comparing the authors themselves under the designation man. For if \"as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,\"[fn-101-P10167_2836984:344-nf] their vivification in Christ must be in the flesh, since it is in the flesh that arises their death in Adam. \"But every man in his own order,\"[fn-101-P10168_2837149:345-nf] because of course it will be also every man in his own body. For the order will be arranged severally, on account of the individual merits. Now, as the merits must be ascribed to the body, it must needs follow that the order also should be arranged in respect of the bodies, that it may be in relation to their merits. But inasmuch as \"some are also baptized for the dead,\"[fn-101-P10169_2837539:346-nf] we will see whether there be a good reason for this. Now it is certain that they adopted this (practice) with such a presumption as made them suppose that the vicarious baptism (in question) would be beneficial to the flesh of another in anticipation of the resurrection; for unless it were a bodily resurrection, there would be no pledge secured by this process of a corporeal baptism. \"Why are they then baptized for the dead,\"[fn-101-P10170_2837986:347-nf] he asks, unless the bodies rise again which are thus baptized? For it is not the soul which is sanctified by the baptismal bath:[fn-101-P10171_2838131:348-nf] its sanctification comes from the \"answer.\"[fn-101-P10172_2838193:349-nf] \"And why,\" he inquires, \"stand we in jeopardy every hour? \"[fn-101-P10173_2838282:350-nf] -meaning, of course, through the flesh. \"I die daily,\"[fn-101-P10174_2838359:351-nf] (says he); that is, undoubtedly, in the perils of the body, in which \"he even fought with beasts at Ephesus,\"[fn-101-P10175_2838485:352-nf] -even with those beasts which caused him such peril and trouble in Asia, to which he alludes in his second epistle to the same church of Corinth: \"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed above measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life.\"[fn-101-P10176_2838829:353-nf] Now, if I mistake not, he enumerates all these particulars in order that in his unwillingness to have his conflicts in the flesh supposed to be useless, he may induce an unfaltering belief in the resurrection of the flesh. For useless must that conflict be deemed (which is sustained in a body) for which no resurrection is in prospect. \"But some man will say, How are the dead to be raised? And with what body will they come? \"[fn-101-P10177_2839278:354-nf] Now here he discusses the qualities of bodies, whether it be the very same, or different ones, which men are to resume. Since, however, such a question as this must be regarded as a subsequent one, it will in passing be enough for us that the resurrection is determined to be a bodily one even from this, that it is about the quality of bodies that the inquiry arises.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":50,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But \"flesh and blood,\" you say, \"cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-101-P10162_2833899:339-nf] We are quite aware that this too is written; but although our opponents place it in the front of the battle, we have intentionally reserved the objection until now, in order that we may in our last assault overthrow it, after we have removed out of the way all the questions which are auxiliary to it.

The preceding statements give us a clue to this point also. He says: \"The first man is of the earth, earthy\"-that is, made of dust, that is, Adam; \"the second man is from heaven\"[fn-101-P10182_2840177:356-nf] -that is, the Word of God, which is Christ, in no other way, however, man (although \"from heaven \"), than as being Himself flesh and soul, just as a human being is, just as Adam was. Indeed, in a previous passage He is called \"the second Adam, \"[fn-101-P10183_2840445:357-nf] deriving the identity of His name from His participation in the substance, because not even Adam was flesh of human seed, in which Christ is also like Him.[fn-101-P10184_2840617:358-nf] \"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.\"[fn-101-P10185_2840773:359-nf] Such (does he mean), in substance; or first of all in training, and afterwards in the dignity and worth which that training aimed at acquiring? Not in substance, however, by any means will the earthy and the heavenly be separated, designated as they have been by the apostle once for all, as men. For even if Christ were the only true \"heavenly,\" nay, super-celestial Being, He is still man, as composed of body and soul; and in no respect is He separated from the quality of \"earthiness,\" owing to that condition of His which makes Him a partaker of both substances. In like manner, those also who after Him are heavenly, are understood to have this celestial quality predicated of them not from their present nature, but from their future glory; because in a preceding sentence, which originated this distinction respecting difference of dignity, there was shown to be \"one glory in celestial bodies, and another in terrestrial ones,\"[fn-101-P10186_2841732:360-nf] -\"one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for even one star differeth from another star in glory, \"[fn-101-P10187_2841899:361-nf] although not in substance. Then, after having thus premised the difference in that worth or dignity which is even now to be aimed at, and then at last to be enjoyed, the apostle adds an exhortation, that we should both here in our training follow the example of Christ, and there attain His eminence in glory: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly.\"[fn-101-P10188_2842313:362-nf] We have indeed borne the image of the earthy, by our sharing in his transgression, by our participation in his death, by our banishment from Paradise. Now, although the image of Adam is here borne by is in the flesh, yet we are not exhorted to put off the flesh; but if not the flesh, it is the conversation, in order that we may then bear the image of the heavenly in ourselves,-no longer indeed the image of God, and no longer the image of a Being whose state is in heaven; but after the lineaments of Christ, by our walking here in holiness, righteousness, and truth. And so wholly intent on the inculcation of moral conduct is he throughout. this passage, that he tells us we ought to bear the image of Christ in this flesh of ours, and in this period of instruction and discipline. For when he says \"let us bear\" in the imperative mood, he suits his words to the present life, in which man exists in no other substance than as flesh and soul; or if it is another, even the heavenly, substance to which this faith (of ours) looks forward, yet the promise is made to that substance to which the injunction is given to labour earnestly to merit its reward. Since, therefore, he makes the image both of the earthy and the heavenly consist of moral conduct-the one to be abjured, and the other to be pursued-and then consistently adds, \"For this I say\" (on account, that is, of what I have already said, because the conjunction \"for\" connects what follows with the preceding words) \"that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-101-P10189_2843870:363-nf] -he means the flesh and blood to be understood in no other sense than the before-mentioned \"image of the earthy; \"and since this is reckoned to consist in \"the old conversation,\"[fn-101-P10190_2844071:364-nf] which old conversation receives not the kingdom of God, therefore flesh and blood, by not receiving the kingdom of God, are reduced to the life of the old conversation. Of course, as the apostle has never put the substance for the works of man, he cannot use such a construction here.

For even if Christ were the only true \"heavenly,\" nay, super-celestial Being, He is still man, as composed of body and soul; and in no respect is He separated from the quality of \"earthiness,\" owing to that condition of His which makes Him a partaker of both substances.

Now, when it is clearly stated what the condition is to which the resurrection does not lead, it is understood what that is to which it does lead; and, therefore, whilst it is in consideration of men's merits that a difference is made in their resurrection by their conduct in the flesh, and not by the substance thereof, it is evident even from this, that flesh and blood are excluded from the kingdom of God in respect of their sin, not of their substance; and although in respect of their natural condition[fn-101-P10199_2846947:370-nf] they will rise again for the judgment, because they rise not for the kingdom.

And with a felicitous sally he proceeds at once to illustrate the point, as if an objector had plied him with some such question. \"Thou fool,\" says he, \"that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.\"[fn-102-P10226_2854318:391-nf] From this example of the seed it is then evident that no other flesh is quickened than that which shall have undergone death, and therefore all the rest of the question will become clear enough. For nothing which is incompatible with the idea suggested by the example can possibly be understood; nor from the clause which follows, \"That which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body which shall be,\"[fn-102-P10227_2854738:392-nf] are you permitted to suppose that in the resurrection a different body is to arise from that which is sown in death. Otherwise you have run away from the example. For if wheat be sown and dissolved in the ground, barley does not spring up. Still it is not[fn-102-P10228_2855010:393-nf] the very same grain in kind; nor is its nature the same, or its quality and form. Then whence comes it, if it is not the very same? For even the decay is a proof of the thing itself, since it is the decay of the actual grain. Well, but does not the apostle himself suggest in what sense it is that \"the body which shall be\" is not the body which is sown, even when he says, \"But bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain; but God giveth it a body as it pleaseth Him? \"[fn-102-P10229_2855533:394-nf] Gives it of course to the grain which he says is sown bare. No doubt, you say. Then the grain is safe enough, to which God has to assign a body. But how safe, if it is nowhere in existence, if it does not rise again if it rises not again its actual self? If it rises not again, it is not safe; and if it is not even safe, it cannot receive a body from God. But there is every possible proof that it is safe. For what purpose, therefore, will God give it \"a body, as it pleases Him,\" even when it already has its own \"bare\" body, unless it be that in its resurrection it may be no longer bare? That therefore will be additional matter which is placed over the bare body; nor is that at all destroyed on which the superimposed matter is put,-nay, it is increased. That, however, is safe which receives augmentation. The truth is, it is sown the barest grain, without a husk to cover it, without a spike even in germ, without the protection of a bearded top, without the glory of a stalk. It rises, however, out of the furrow enriched with a copious crop, built up in a compact fabric, constructed in a beautiful order, fortified by cultivation, and clothed around on every side. These are the circumstances which make it another body from God, to which it is changed not by abolition, but by amplification. And to every seed God has assigned its own body[fn-102-P10230_2856907:395-nf] -not, indeed, its own in the sense of its primitive body-in order that what it acquires from God extrinsically may also at last be accounted its own. Cleave firmly then to the example, and keep it well in view, as a mirror of what happens to the flesh: believe that the very same flesh which was once sown in death will bear fruit in resurrection-life-the same in essence, only more full and perfect; not another, although reappearing in another form.

For again, predicating the resurrection of the same substance and returning once more to (his comparison of) the grain, he says: \"It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-102-P10236_2859539:401-nf] Now, certainly nothing else is raised than that which is sown; and nothing else is sown than that which decays in the ground; and it is nothing else than the flesh which is decayed in the ground. For this was the substance which God's decree demolished, \"Earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou return; \"[fn-102-P10237_2859864:402-nf] because it was taken out of the earth. And it was from this circumstance that the apostle borrowed his phrase of the flesh being \"sown,\" since it returns to the ground, and the ground is the grand depository for seeds which are meant to be deposited in it, and again sought out of it. And therefore he confirms the passage afresh, by putting on it the impress (of his own inspired authority), saying, \"For so it is written; \"[fn-102-P10238_2860311:403-nf] that you may not suppose that the \"being sown\" means anything else than \"thou shalt return to the ground, out of which thou wast taken; \"nor that the phrase \"for so it is written\" refers to any other thing that the flesh.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":42,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":55,"source_paragraph":"173","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Some, however, contend that the soul is \"the natural (or animate) body, \"[fn-102-P10242_2860825:404-nf] with the view of withdrawing the flesh from all connection with the risen body. Now, since it is a clear and fixed point that the body which is to rise again is that which was sown in death, they must be challenged to an examination of the very fact itself. Else let them show that the soul was sown after death; in a word, that it underwent death,-that is, was demolished, dismembered, dissolved in the ground, nothing of which was ever decreed against it by God: let them display to our view its corruptibility and dishonour (as well as) its weakness, that it may also accrue to it to rise again in incorruption, and in glory, and in power.[fn-102-P10243_2861721:405-nf] Now in the ease of Lazarus, (which we may take as) the palmary instance of a resurrection, the flesh lay prostrate in weakness, the flesh was almost putrid in the dishonour of its decay, the flesh stank in corruption, and yet it was as flesh that Lazarus rose again-with his soul, no doubt. But that soul was incorrupt; nobody had wrapped it in its linen swathes; nobody had deposited it in a grave; nobody had yet perceived it \"stink; \"nobody for four days had seen it \"sown.\" Well, now, this entire condition, this whole end of Lazarus, the flesh indeed of all men is still experiencing, but the soul of no one. That substance, therefore, to which the apostle's whole description manifestly refers, of which he clearly speaks, must be both the natural (or animate) body when it is sown, and the spiritual body when it is raised again. For in order that you may understand it in this sense, he points to this same conclusion, when in like manner, on the authority of the same passage of Scripture, he displays to us \"the first man Adam as made a living soul.\"[fn-102-P10244_2862808:406-nf] Now since Adam was the first man, since also the flesh was man prior to the soul[fn-102-P10245_2862929:407-nf] it undoubtedly follows that it was the flesh that became the living soul. Moreover, since it was a bodily substance that assumed this condition, it was of course the natural (or animate) body that became the living soul. By what designation would they have it called, except that which it became through the soul, except that which it was not previous to the soul, except that which it can never be after the soul, but through its resurrection? For after it has recovered the soul, it once more becomes the natural (or animate) body, in order that it may become a spiritual body. For it only resumes in the resurrection the condition which it once had. There is therefore by no means the same good reason why the soul should be called the natural (or animate) body, which the flesh has for bearing that designation. The flesh, in fact, was a body before it was an animate body. When the flesh was joined by the soul,[fn-102-P10246_2863906:408-nf] it then became the natural (or animate) body. Now, although the soul is a corporeal substance,[fn-102-P10247_2864017:409-nf] yet, as it is not an animated body, but rather an animating one, it cannot be called the animate (or natural) body, nor can it become that thing which it produces. It is indeed when the soul accrues to something else that it makes that thing animate; but unless it so accrues, how will it ever produce animation? As therefore the flesh was at first an animate (or natural) body on receiving the soul, so at last will it become a spiritual body when invested with the spirit. Now the apostle, by severally adducing this order in Adam and in Christ, fairly distinguishes between the two states, in the very essentials of their difference. And when he calls Christ \"the last Adam,\"[fn-102-P10248_2864797:410-nf] you may from this circumstance discover how strenuously he labours to establish throughout his teaching the resurrection of the flesh, not of the soul. Thus, then, the first man Adam was flesh, not soul, and only afterwards became a living soul; and the last Adam, Christ, was Adam only because He was man, and only man as being flesh, not as being soul. Accordingly the apostle goes on to say: \"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual,\"[fn-102-P10249_2865329:411-nf] as in the case of the two Adams. Now, do you not suppose that he is distinguishing between the natural body and the spiritual body in the same flesh, after having already drawn the distinction therein in the two Adams, that is, in the first man and in the last? For from which substance is it that Christ and Adam have a parity with each other? No doubt it is from their flesh, although it may be from their soul also. It is, however, in respect of the flesh that they are both man; for the flesh was man prior to the saul. It was actually from it that they were able to take rank, so as to be deemed-one the first, and the other the last man, or Adam. Besides, things which are different in character are only incapable of being arranged in the same order when their diversity is one of substance; for when it is a diversity either in respect of place, or of time, or of condition, they probably do admit of classification together. Here, however, they are called first and last, from the substance of their (common) flesh, just as afterwards again the first man (is said to be) of the earth, and the second of heaven;[fn-102-P10250_2866471:412-nf] but although He is \"of heaven\" in respect of the spirit, He is yet man according to the flesh.

What, they ask, will then be the use of the cavity of our mouth, and its rows of teeth, and the passage of the throat, and the branch-way of the stomach, and the gulf of the belly, and the entangled tissue of the bowels, when there shall no longer be room for eating and drinking? What more will there be for these members to take in, masticate, swallow, secrete, digest, eject? Of what avail will be our very hands, and feet, and all our labouring limbs, when even all care about food shall cease? What purpose can be served by loins, conscious of seminal secretions, and all the other organs of generation, in the two sexes, and the laboratories of embryos, and the fountains of the breast, when concubinage, and pregnancy, and infant nurture shall cease? In short, what will be the use of the entire body, when the entire body shall become useless? In reply to all this, we have then already settled the principle that the dispensation of the future state ought not to be compared with that of the present world, and that in the interval between them a change will take place; and we now add the remark, that these functions of our bodily limbs will continue to supply the needs of this life up to the moment when life itself shall pass away from time to eternity, as the natural body gives place to the spiritual, until \"this mortal puts on immorality, and this corruptible puts on incorruption: \"[fn-103-P10324_2890912:464-nf] so that when life shall itself become freed from all wants, our limbs shall then be freed also from their services, and therefore will be no longer wanted. Still, although liberated from their offices, they will be yet preserved for judgment, \"that every one may receive the things done in his body.\"[fn-103-P10325_2891235:465-nf] For the judgment-seat of God requires that man be kept entire. Entire, however, he cannot be without his limbs, of the substance of which, not the functions, he consists; unless, forsooth, you will be bold enough to maintain that a ship is perfect without her keel, or her bow, or her stern, and without the solidity of her entire t frame. And yet how often have we seen the same ship, after being shattered with the storm and broken by decay, with all her timbers repaired and restored, gallantly riding on the wave in all the beauty of a renewed fabric! Do we then disquiet ourselves with doubt about God's skill, and will, and rights? Besides, if a wealthy shipowner, who does not grudge money merely for his amusement or show, thoroughly repairs his ship, and then chooses that she should make no further voyages, will you contend that the old form and finish is still not necessary to the vessel, although she is no longer meant for actual service, when the mere safety of a ship requires such completeness irrespective of service? The sole question, therefore, which is enough for us to consider here, is whether the Lord, when He ordains salvation for man, intends it for his flesh; whether it is His will that the selfsame flesh shall be renewed. If so, it will be improper for you to rule, from the in utility of its limbs in the future state, that the flesh will be incapable of renovation. For a thing may be renewed, and yet be useless from having nothing to do; but it cannot be said to be useless if it has no existence. If, indeed, it has existence, it will be quite possible for it also not to be useless; it may possibly have something to do; for in the presence of God there will be no idleness.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":56,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"They declare \"that we say that the law of the Old Testament was given not for the end that it might justify the obedient, but rather that it might become the cause of greater sin.\" Certainly, they do not understand what we say concerning the law; because we say what the apostle says, whom they do not understand.

These are the misty questions of the praise of the creature, of the praise of marriage, of the praise of the law, of the praise of free will, of the praise of the saints; as if any one of our people were in the habit of disparaging those things, and not rather of announcing all things with due praises to the honour of the Creator and Saviour. But even the creature does not desire in such wise to be praised as to be unwilling to be healed. And the more marriage is to be praised, the less is to be attributed to it the shameful concupiscence of the flesh, which is not of the Father, but of the world; and which assuredly marriage found and did not make in men; because, moreover, it is actually in very many without marriage, and if nobody had sinned marriage itself might be without it.

About this, certainly, tile apostle was speaking; hence it happened that he interposed what he says, \"That sin entered by one man.\" For these are his former words. He says, \"But God commendeth His love towards us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified in His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by tile death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.

Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: \"No man hath seen God at any time; \"[fn-105-P10594_2976311:172-nf] meaning, of course, at any previous time But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, \"Whom no man hath seen, nor can see; \"[fn-105-P10595_2976569:173-nf] because the man indeed would die who should see Him.[fn-105-P10596_2976644:174-nf] But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and \"handled\" Christ.[fn-105-P10597_2976777:175-nf] Now, if Christ is Himself both the Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. \"That,\" says John, \"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-105-P10598_2978120:176-nf] Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the \"Word in the beginning with God\" the Father,[fn-105-P10599_2978329:177-nf] and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.[fn-106-P10603_2979484:181-nf] He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the Father. \"Have I not,\" he says, \"seen Jesus Christ our Lord? \"[fn-106-P10604_2979716:182-nf] Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: \"Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-106-P10605_2979902:183-nf] He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: \"Whom none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see; \"and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.\"[fn-106-P10606_2980285:184-nf] It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God; \"[fn-106-P10607_2980435:185-nf] so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself-mortality, accessibility-of whom the apostle testifies that \"He died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-106-P10608_2980625:186-nf] and that \"He was seen by himself last of all,\"[fn-106-P10609_2980693:187-nf] -by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light.[fn-106-P10610_2980847:188-nf] A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,[fn-106-P10611_2981080:189-nf] had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: \"For no man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-106-P10612_2981214:190-nf] This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary, ) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two-the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do\"[fn-106-P10613_2981760:191-nf] -\"do\" that is, in His mind and thought.[fn-106-P10614_2981819:192-nf] For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought,[fn-106-P10615_2981934:193-nf] gives effect and form to what He sees. Thus all things were made by tile Son, and without Him was not anything made.[fn-106-P10616_2982167:194-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Silence! Silence on such blasphemy. Let us be content with saving that Christ died, the Son of the Father; and let this suffice, because the Scriptures have told us so much. For even the apostle, to his declaration-which he makes not without feeling the weight of it-that \"Christ died,\" immediately adds, \"according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-108-P10873_3053221:409-nf] in order that he may alleviate the harshness of the statement by the authority of the Scriptures, and so remove offence from the reader. Now, although when two substances are alleged to be in Christ-namely, the divine and the human- it plainly follows that the divine nature is immortal, and that which is human is mortal, it is manifest in what sense he declares \"Christ died\"-even in the sense in which He was flesh and Man and the Son of Man, not as being the Spirit and the Word and the Son of God. In short, since he says that it was Christ (that is, the Anointed One) that died, he shows us that that which died was the nature which was anointed; in a word, the flesh. Very well, say you; since we on our side affirm our doctrine in precisely the same terms which you use on your side respecting the Son, we are not guilty of blasphemy against the Lord God, for we do not maintain that He died after the divine nature, but only after the human. Nay, but you do blaspheme; because you allege not only that the Father died, but that He died the death of the cross. For \"cursed are they which are hanged on a tree,\"[fn-108-P10874_3054362:410-nf] -a curse which, after the law, is compatible to the Son (inasmuch as \"Christ has been made a curse for us,\"[fn-108-P10875_3054491:411-nf] but certainly not the Father); since, however, you convert Christ into the Father, you are chargeable with blasphemy against the Father. But when we assert that Christ was crucified, we do not malign Him with a curse; we only re-affirm[fn-108-P10876_3054744:412-nf] the curse pronounced by the law:[fn-108-P10877_3054820:413-nf] nor indeed did the apostle utter blasphemy when he said the same thing as we.[fn-108-P10878_3054920:414-nf] Besides, as there is no blasphemy in predicating of the subject that which is fairly applicable to it; so, on the other hand, it is blasphemy when that is alleged concerning the subject which is unsuitable to it. On this principle, too, the Father was not associated in suffering with the Son. The heretics, indeed, fearing to incur direct blasphemy against the Father, hope to diminish it by this expedient: they grant us so far that the Father and the Son are Two; adding that, since it iS the Son indeed who suffers, the Father is only His fellow-sufferer.[fn-108-P10879_3055501:415-nf] But how absurd are they even in this conceit! For what is the meaning of \"fellow-suffering,\" but the endurance of suffering along with another? Now if the Father is incapable of suffering, He. is incapable of suffering in company with another; otherwise, if He can suffer with another, He is of course capable of suffering. You, in fact, yield Him nothing by this subterfuge of your fears. You are afraid to say that He is capable of suffering whom you make to be capable of fellow-suffering. Then, again, the Father is as incapable of fellow-suffering as the Son even is of suffering under the conditions of His existence as God. Well, but how could the Son suffer, if the Father did not suffer with Him? My answer is, The Father is separate from the Son, though not from Him as God. For even if a river be soiled with mire and mud, although it flows from the fountain identical in nature with it, and is not separated from the fountain, yet the injury which affects the stream reaches not to the fountain; and although it is the water of the fountain which suffers down the stream, still, since it is not affected at the fountain, but only in the river, the fountain suffers nothing, but only the river which issues from the fountain. So likewise the Spirit of God,[fn-108-P10880_3056873:416-nf] whatever suffering it might be capable of in the Son, yet, inasmuch as it could not suffer in the Father, the fountain of the Godhead, but only in the Son, it evidently could not have suffered,[fn-108-P10881_3057127:417-nf] as the Father. But it is enough for me that the Spirit of God suffered nothing as the Spirit of God,[fn-108-P10882_3057283:418-nf] since all that It suffered It suffered in the Son. It was quite another matter for the Father to suffer with the Son in the flesh. This likewise has been treated by us. Nor will any one deny this, since even we are ourselves unable to suffer for God, unless the Spirit of God be in us, who also utters by our instrumentality[fn-108-P10883_3057627:419-nf] whatever pertains to our own conduct and suffering; not, however, that He Himself suffers in our suffering, only He bestows on us the power and capacity of suffering.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself, so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about that? You have Him exclaiming in the midst of His passion: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? \"[fn-108-P10887_3058403:420-nf] Either, then, the Son suffered, being \"forsaken\" by the Father, and the Father consequently suffered nothing, inasmuch as He forsook the Son; or else, if it was the Father who suffered, then to what God was it that He addressed His cry? But this was the voice of flesh and soul, that is to say, of man-not of the Word and Spirit, that is to say, not of God; and it was uttered so as to prove the impassibility of God, who \"forsook\" His Son, so far as He handed over His human substance to the suffering of death. This verity the apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: \"If the Father spa. red not His own Son.\"[fn-108-P10888_3059054:421-nf] This did Isaiah before him likewise perceive, when he declared: \"And the Lord hath delivered Him up for our offences.\"[fn-108-P10889_3059195:422-nf] In this manner He \"forsook\" Him, in not sparing Him; \"forsook\" Him, in delivering Him up.

No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all from a man's own will when he performs any act in accordance with God. Indeed, a work is then to be pronounced a good one when a person does it willingly; then, too, may the reward of a good work be hoped for from Him concerning whom it is written, \"He shall reward every man according to his works.\"[fn-59-P5931_2318743:37-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":56,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"It is concerning conjugal chastity itself that the apostle treats, when he says, \"Let him do what he will, he sinneth not if he marry;\"[fn-59-P5957_2326929:51-nf] and yet this too is God's gift, for the Scripture says, \"It is by the Lord that the woman is joined to her husband.\" Accordingly the teacher of the Gentiles, in one of his discourses, commends both conjugal chastity, whereby adulteries are prevented, and the still more perfect continence which foregoes all cohabitation, and shows how both one and the other are severally the gift of God.

I believe the words of the wise, that every fair and God-be-loved soul, when, set free from the bonds of the body, it departs hence, at once enjoys a sense and perception of the blessings which await it, inasmuch as that which darkened it has been purged away, or laid aside-I know not how else to term it-and feels a wondrous pleasure and exultation, and goes rejoicing to meet its Lord, having escaped as it were from the grievous poison of life here, and shaken off the fetters which bound it and held down the wings of the mind, and so enters on the enjoyment of the bliss laid up for it, of which it has even now some conception. Then, a little later, it receives its kindred flesh, which once shared in its pursuits of things above, from the earth which both gave and had been entrusted with it, and in some way known to God, who knit them together and dissolved them, enters with it upon the inheritance of the glory there. And, as it shared, through their close union, in its hardships, so also it bestows upon it a portion of its joys, gathering it up entirely into itself, and becoming with it one in spirit and in mind and in God, the mortal and mutable being swallowed up of life.

It naturally followed then in the case of Peter, against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, that he did not taste of death, since any one tastes of death and eats death at the time when the gates of Hades prevail against him; and one eats or tastes of death in proportion as the gates of Hades to a greater or less extent, more or fewer in number, prevail against him. But also for the sons of thunder who were begotten of thunder, which is a heavenly thing, it was impossible to taste of death, which is extremely far removed from thunder, their mother. But these things the Word prophesies to those who shall be perfected, and who by standing with the Word advanced so far that they did not taste of death, until they saw the manifestation and the glory and the kingdom and the excellency of the Word of God in virtue of which He excels every word, which by an appearance of truth draws away and drags about those who are not able to break through the bonds of distraction, and go up to the height of the excellency of the Word of truth.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":15,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_36_on_the_making_of_man","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"213","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"3.

We have therefore to give those who are disturbed by this the answer, that they were not prohibited from seeking necessary sustenance by their manual craft, when lawful in itself, and warranted so long as they preserved their apostleship intact, if at any time they had no other means of gaining a livelihood. Unless any one have the boldness to imagine or to affirm, that the Apostle Paul attained not to the perfection of those who left all and followed Christ, seeing that, in order not to become a burden to any of those to whom he preached the gospel, be worked with his own hands for his support:[fn-38-P3842_2110828:4-nf] wherein we find rather the fulfillment of his own words, \"I labored more abundantly than they all;\" and to which he added, \"yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me:\"[fn-38-P3843_2111023:5-nf] to make it manifest that this also was to be imputed to the grace of God, that both with mind and body he was able to labor so much more abundantly than they all, that he neither ceased from preaching the gospel, nor drew, like them, his present support out of the gospel; while he was sowing it much more widely and fruitfully through multitudes of nations where the name of Christ had never previously been proclaimed. Whereby he showed that living, that is, deriving their subsistence, by the gospel, was not imposed on the apostles as a necessity, but conferred on them as a power. And of this power the same apostle makes mention when he says: \"If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things? If others are partakers of this power among you, are not we rather? But,\" he adds, \"we have not used this power.\" And a little afterwards he says: \"They who serve the altar are partakers with the altar: even so hath the Lord ordained, that they who preach the gospel should live of the gospel; but I have used none of these things.\" It is clear enough, therefore, that it was not enjoined on the apostles, but put in their power, not to find their living otherwise than by the gospel, and of those to whom by preaching the gospel they sowed spiritual things, to reap their carnal things; that is, to take their bodily support, and, as the soldiers of Christ, to receive the wages due to them, as from the inhabitants of provinces subject to Christ.[fn-38-P3844_2112532:6-nf] Hence that same illustrious soldier had said a little before, in reference to this matter, \"Who goetha warfare any time at his own charges?\"[fn-38-P3845_2112708:7-nf] Which he nevertheless did himself; for he labored more abundantly than they all. If, then, the blessed Paul-that he might not use with them the power which he certainly possessed along with the other preachers of the gospel, but went a warfare at his own charges, that the Gentiles, who were utterly averse to the name of Christ, might not take offense at his teaching, as something offered them for a money equivalent,-in a way very different from that in which he had been educated, learned an altogether new art, that while the teacher supports himself with his own hands, none of his hearers might be burdened; how much rather did the blessed Peter, who had beforetimes been a fisherman, do what he was already acquainted with, if at that present time he found no other means of gaining a livelihood?","title":"Tractate CXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":42,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_44_origen_de_principiis_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-04","text":"5.

For He wished to make man, now plucked from the devil's throat by faith, trample upon him likewise by courage, that he might not merely have escaped from, but also completely vanquished, his enemy. He who had called to salvation has been pleased to summon to glory also, that they who were rejoicing in consequence of their deliverance may be in transports when they are crowned likewise. With what good-will the world celebrates those games, the combative festivals and superstitious contests of the Greeks, involving forms both of worship and of pleasure, has now become clear in Africa also. As yet cities, by sending their congratulations severally, annoy Carthage, which was presented with the Pythian game after the racecourse had attained to an old age. Thus, by the world[fn-110-P11015_3106888:38-nf] it has been believed to be a most proper mode of testing proficiency in studies, to put in competition the forms of skill, to elicit the existing condition of bodies and of voices, the reward being the informer, the public exhibition the judge, and pleasure the decision. Where there are mere contests, there are some wounds: fists make reel, heels kick like butting rams, boxing-gloves mangle, whips leave gashes. Yet there will be no one reproaching the superintendent of the contest for exposing men to outrage. Suits for injuries lie outside the racecourse. But to the extent that those persons deal in discoloration, and gore, and swellings, he will design for them crowns, doubtless, and glory, and a present, political privileges, contributions by the citizens, images, statues, and-of such sort as the world can give-an eternity of fame, a resurrection by being kept in remembrance. The pugilist himself does not complain of feeling pain, for he wishes it; the crown closes the wounds, the palm hides the blood: he is excited more by victory than by injury. Will you count this man hurt whom you see happy? But not even the vanquished himself will reproach the superintendent of the contest for his misfortune. Shall it be unbecoming in God to bring forth kinds of skill and rules of His own into public view, into this open ground of the world, to be seen by men, and angels, and all powers?-to test flesh and spirit as to stedfastness and endurance?-to give to this one the palm, to this one distinction, to that one the privilege of citizenship, to that one pay?-to reject some also, and after punishing to remove them with disgrace? You dictate to God, forsooth, the times, or the ways, or the places in which to institute a trial concerning His own troop (of competitors) as if it were not proper for the Judge to pronounce the preliminary decision also. Well now, if He had put forth faith to suffer martyrdoms not for the contest's sake, but for its own benefit, ought it not to have had some store of hope, for the increase of which it might restrain desire of its own, and check its wish in order that it might strive to mount up, seeing they also who discharge earthly functions are eager for promotion? Or how will there be many mansions in our Father's house, if not to accord with a diversity of deserts? How will one star also differ from another star in glory, unless in virtue of disparity in their rays?[fn-110-P11016_3109345:39-nf] But further, if, on that account, some increase of brightness also was appropriate to loftiness of faith, that gain ought to have been of some such sort as would cost great effort, poignant suffering, torture, death. But consider the requital, when flesh and life are paid away-than which in man there is nought more precious, the one from the hand of God, the other from His breath-that the very things are paid away in obtaining the benefit of which the benefit consists; that the very things are expended which may be acquired; that the same things are the price which are also the commodities. God had foreseen also other weaknesses incident to the condition of man,-the stratagems of the enemy, the deceptive aspects of the creatures, the snares of the world; that faith, even after baptism, would be endangered; that the most, after attaining unto salvation, would be lost again, through soiling the wedding-dress, through failing to provide oil for their torchlets-would be such as would have to be sought for over mountains and woodlands, and carried back upon the shoulders. He therefore appointed as second supplies of comfort, and the last means of succour, the fight of martyrdom and the baptism-thereafter free from danger-of blood. And concerning the happiness of the man who has partaken of these, David says: \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.\"[fn-110-P11017_3110825:40-nf] For, strictly speaking, there cannot any longer be reckoned ought against the martyrs, by whom in the baptism (of blood) life itself is laid down. Thus, \"love covers the multitude of sins; \"[fn-110-P11018_3111052:41-nf] and loving God, to wit, with all its strength (by which in the endurance of martyrdom it maintains the fight), with all its life[fn-110-P11019_3111200:42-nf] (which it lays down for God), it makes of man a martyr. Shall you call these cures, counsels, methods of judging, spectacles, (illustrations of) even the barbarity of God? Does God covet man's blood? And yet I might venture to affirm that He does, if man also covets the kingdom of heaven, if man covets a sure salvation, if man also covets a second new birth.

Observe, then, that I can hear David, in the midst of his praises in the Divine Songs, saying at the end of the hymnody of the hundred and third (104th) Psalm, where he has taken for his theme God's administration of the world, \"Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall die, and return to their dust: Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.\" He says that a power of the Spirit which works in all vivifies the beings into whom it enters, and deprives those whom He abandons of their life. Seeing, then, that the dying is declared to occur at the Spirit's departure, and the renewal of these dead ones at His appearance, and seeing moreover that in the order of the statement the death of those who are to be thus renewed comes first, we hold that in these words that mystery of the Resurrection is proclaimed to the Church, and that David in the spirit of prophecy expressed this very gift which you are asking about. You will find this same prophet in another place[fn-37-P3754_2439883:155-nf] also saying that \"the God of the world, the Lord of everything that is, hath showed Himself to us, that we may keep the Feast amongst the decorators;\" by that mention of \"decoration\" with boughs, he means the Feast of Tabernacle-fixing, which, in accordance with Moses' injunction, has been observed from of old. That lawgiver, I take it, adopting a prophet's spirit, predicted therein things still to come; for though the decoration was always going on it was never finished. The truth indeed was foreshadowed under the type and riddle of those Feasts that were always occurring, but the true Tabernacle-fixing was not yet come; and on this account \"the God and Lord of the whole world,\" according to the Prophet's declaration, \"hath showed Himself to us, that the Tabernacle-fixing of this our tenement that has been dissolved may be kept for human kind\"; a material decoration, that is, may be begun again by means of the concourse of our scattered atoms. For that word pukasmoj in its peculiar meaning signifies the Temple-circuit and the decoration which completes it. Now this passage from the Psalms runs as follows: \"God and Lord hath showed Himself to us; keep the Feast amongst the decorators even unto the horns of the altar;\" and this seems to me to proclaim in metaphors the fact that one single feast is to be kept by the whole rational creation, and that in that assembly of the saints tire inferiors are to join the dance with their superiors. For in the case of the fabric of that Temple which was the Type it was not allowed to all who were on the outside of its circuit[fn-37-P3755_2442523:156-nf] to come within, but everything that was Gentile and alien was prohibited from entering; and of those, further, who had entered, all were not equally privileged to advance towards the centre; but only those who had consecrated themselves by a holier manner of life, and by certain sprinklings; and, again, not every one amongst these last might set foot within the interior of the Temple; the priests alone had the right of entering within the Curtain, and that only for the service of the sanctuary; while even to the priests the darkened shrine of the Temple, where stood the beautiful Altar with its jutting horns, was forbidden, except to one of them, who held the highest office of the priesthood, and who once a year, on a stated day, and unattended, passed within it, carrying an offering more than usually sacred and mystical. Such being the differences in connection with this Temple which you know of, it was clearly[fn-37-P3756_2443488:157-nf] a representation and an imitation of the condition of the spirit-world, the lesson taught by these material observances being this, that it is not the whole of the rational creation that can approach the temple of God, or, in other words, the adoration of the Almighty; but that those who are led astray by false persuasions are outside the precinct of the Deity; and that from the number of those who by virtue of this adoration have been preferred to the rest and admitted within it, some by reason of sprinklings and purifications have still further privileges; and again amongst these last those who have been consecrated priests have privileges further still, even to being admitted to the mysteries of the interior. And, that one may bring into still clearer light the meaning of the allegory, we may understand the Word here as teaching this, that amongst all the Powers endued with reason some have been fixed like a Holy Altar in the inmost shrine of the Deity; and that again of these last some jut forward like horns, for their eminence, and that around them others are arranged first or second, according to a prescribed sequence of rank; that the race of man, on the contrary, on account of indwelling evil was excluded from the Divine precinct, but that purified with lustral water it re-enters it; and, since all the further barriers by which our sin has fenced us off from the things within the veil are in the end to be taken down, whenever the time comes that the tabernacle of our nature is as it were to be fixed up again in the Resurrection, and all the inveterate corruption of sin has vanished from the world, then a universal feast will be kept around the Deity by those who have decorated themselves in the Resurrection; and one and the same banquet will be spread for all, with no differences cutting off any rational creature from an equal participation in it; for those who are now excluded by reason of their sin will at last be admitted within the Holiest places of God's blessedness, and will bind themselves to the horns of the Altar there, that is, to the most excellent of the transcendental Powers. The Apostle says the same thing more plainly when he indicates the final accord of the whole Universe with the Good: \"That\" to Him \"every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\": instead of the \"horns,\" speaking of that which is angelic and \"in heaven,\" and by the other terms signifying ourselves, the creatures whom we think of next to that; one festival of united voices shall occupy us all; that festival shall be the confession and the recognition of the Being Who truly Is. One might (she proceeded) select many other passages of Holy Scripture to establish the doctrine of the Resurrection. For instance, Ezekiel leaps in the spirit of prophecy over all the intervening time, with its vast duration; he stands, by his powers of foresight, in the actual moment of the Resurrection, and, as if he had really gazed on what is still to come, brings it in his description before our eyes. He saw a mighty plain[fn-37-P3757_2446703:158-nf] , unfolded to an endless distance before him, and vast heaps of bones upon it flung at random, some this way, some that; and then under an impulse from God these bones began to move and group themselves with their fellows that they once owned, and adhere to the familiar sockets, and then clothe themselves with muscle, flesh, and skin (which was the process called \"decorating\" in the poetry of the Psalms); a Spirit in fact was giving life and movement to everything that lay there. But as regards our Apostle's description of the wonders of the Resurrection, why should one repeat it, seeing that it can easily be found and read? how, for instance, \"with a shout\" and the \"sound of trumpets\" (in the language of the Word) all dead and prostrate things shall be \"changed[fn-37-P3758_2447503:159-nf] in the twinkling of an eye\" into immortal beings. The expressions in the Gospels also I will pass over; for their meaning is quite clear to every one; and our Lord does not declare in word alone that the bodies of the dead shall be raised up again; but He shows in action the Resurrection itself, making a beginning of this work of wonder from things more within our reach and less capable of being doubted. First, that is, He displays His life-giving power in the case of the deadly forms of disease, and chases those maladies by one word of command; then He raises a little girl just dead; then He makes a young man, who is already being carried out, sit up on his bier, and delivers him to his mother; after that He calls forth from his tomb the four-days-dead and already decomposed Lazarus, vivifying the prostrate body with His commanding voice; then after three days He raises from the dead His own human body, pierced though it was with the nails and spear, and brings the print of those nails and the spear-wound to witness to the Resurrection. But I think that a detailed mention of these things is not necessary; for no doubt about them lingers in the minds of those who have accepted the written accounts of them.","title":"On the Soul and the Resurrection","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":15,"verse":52,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_37_on_the_soul_and_the_resurrection","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"133","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"She, however, replied, First, I think, we must briefly run over the scattered proclamations of this doctrine in Holy Scripture; they shall give the finishing touch to our discourse.

For in the case of the fabric of that Temple which was the Type it was not allowed to all who were on the outside of its circuit[fn-37-P3755_2442523:156-nf] to come within, but everything that was Gentile and alien was prohibited from entering; and of those, further, who had entered, all were not equally privileged to advance towards the centre; but only those who had consecrated themselves by a holier manner of life, and by certain sprinklings; and, again, not every one amongst these last might set foot within the interior of the Temple; the priests alone had the right of entering within the Curtain, and that only for the service of the sanctuary; while even to the priests the darkened shrine of the Temple, where stood the beautiful Altar with its jutting horns, was forbidden, except to one of them, who held the highest office of the priesthood, and who once a year, on a stated day, and unattended, passed within it, carrying an offering more than usually sacred and mystical. Such being the differences in connection with this Temple which you know of, it was clearly[fn-37-P3756_2443488:157-nf] a representation and an imitation of the condition of the spirit-world, the lesson taught by these material observances being this, that it is not the whole of the rational creation that can approach the temple of God, or, in other words, the adoration of the Almighty; but that those who are led astray by false persuasions are outside the precinct of the Deity; and that from the number of those who by virtue of this adoration have been preferred to the rest and admitted within it, some by reason of sprinklings and purifications have still further privileges; and again amongst these last those who have been consecrated priests have privileges further still, even to being admitted to the mysteries of the interior. And, that one may bring into still clearer light the meaning of the allegory, we may understand the Word here as teaching this, that amongst all the Powers endued with reason some have been fixed like a Holy Altar in the inmost shrine of the Deity; and that again of these last some jut forward like horns, for their eminence, and that around them others are arranged first or second, according to a prescribed sequence of rank; that the race of man, on the contrary, on account of indwelling evil was excluded from the Divine precinct, but that purified with lustral water it re-enters it; and, since all the further barriers by which our sin has fenced us off from the things within the veil are in the end to be taken down, whenever the time comes that the tabernacle of our nature is as it were to be fixed up again in the Resurrection, and all the inveterate corruption of sin has vanished from the world, then a universal feast will be kept around the Deity by those who have decorated themselves in the Resurrection; and one and the same banquet will be spread for all, with no differences cutting off any rational creature from an equal participation in it; for those who are now excluded by reason of their sin will at last be admitted within the Holiest places of God's blessedness, and will bind themselves to the horns of the Altar there, that is, to the most excellent of the transcendental Powers. The Apostle says the same thing more plainly when he indicates the final accord of the whole Universe with the Good: \"That\" to Him \"every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\": instead of the \"horns,\" speaking of that which is angelic and \"in heaven,\" and by the other terms signifying ourselves, the creatures whom we think of next to that; one festival of united voices shall occupy us all; that festival shall be the confession and the recognition of the Being Who truly Is. One might (she proceeded) select many other passages of Holy Scripture to establish the doctrine of the Resurrection. For instance, Ezekiel leaps in the spirit of prophecy over all the intervening time, with its vast duration; he stands, by his powers of foresight, in the actual moment of the Resurrection, and, as if he had really gazed on what is still to come, brings it in his description before our eyes. He saw a mighty plain[fn-37-P3757_2446703:158-nf] , unfolded to an endless distance before him, and vast heaps of bones upon it flung at random, some this way, some that; and then under an impulse from God these bones began to move and group themselves with their fellows that they once owned, and adhere to the familiar sockets, and then clothe themselves with muscle, flesh, and skin (which was the process called \"decorating\" in the poetry of the Psalms); a Spirit in fact was giving life and movement to everything that lay there. But as regards our Apostle's description of the wonders of the Resurrection, why should one repeat it, seeing that it can easily be found and read? how, for instance, \"with a shout\" and the \"sound of trumpets\" (in the language of the Word) all dead and prostrate things shall be \"changed[fn-37-P3758_2447503:159-nf] in the twinkling of an eye\" into immortal beings. The expressions in the Gospels also I will pass over; for their meaning is quite clear to every one; and our Lord does not declare in word alone that the bodies of the dead shall be raised up again; but He shows in action the Resurrection itself, making a beginning of this work of wonder from things more within our reach and less capable of being doubted. First, that is, He displays His life-giving power in the case of the deadly forms of disease, and chases those maladies by one word of command; then He raises a little girl just dead; then He makes a young man, who is already being carried out, sit up on his bier, and delivers him to his mother; after that He calls forth from his tomb the four-days-dead and already decomposed Lazarus, vivifying the prostrate body with His commanding voice; then after three days He raises from the dead His own human body, pierced though it was with the nails and spear, and brings the print of those nails and the spear-wound to witness to the Resurrection. But I think that a detailed mention of these things is not necessary; for no doubt about them lingers in the minds of those who have accepted the written accounts of them.","title":"On the Soul and the Resurrection","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":15,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_37_on_the_soul_and_the_resurrection","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"\"It is sown,\" he says, \"in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" The grain of wheat, after its dissolution in the soil, leaves behind the slightness of its bulk and the peculiar quality of its shape, and yet it has not left and lost itself, but, still self-centred, grows into the ear, though in many points it has made an advance upon itself, viz. in size, in splendour, in complexity, in form. In the same fashion the human being deposits in death all those peculiar surroundings which it has acquired from passionate propensities; dishonour, I mean, and corruption and weakness and characteristics of age; and yet the human being does not lose itself. It changes into an ear of corn as it were; into incorruption, that is, and glory and honour and power and absolute perfection; into a condition in which its life is no longer carried on in the ways peculiar to mere nature, but has passed into a spiritual and passionless existence. For it is the peculiarity of the natural body to be always moving on a stream, to be always altering from its state for the moment and changing into something else; but none of these processes, which we observe not in man only but also in plants and brutes will be found remaining in the life that shall be then. Further, it seems to me that the words of the Apostle in every respect harmonize with our own conception of what the Resurrection is. They indicate the very same thing that we have embodied in our own definition of it, wherein we said that the Resurrection is no other thing than \"the re-constitution of our nature in its original form.\" For, whereas we learn from Scripture in the account of the first Creation[fn-37-P3782_2480864:178-nf] , that first the earth brought forth \"the green herb\" (as the narrative says), and that then from this plant seed was yielded, from which, when it was shed on the ground, the same form of the original plant again sprang up, the Apostle, it is to be observed, declares that this very same thing happens in the Resurrection also; and so we learn from him the fact, not only[fn-37-P3783_2481496:179-nf] that our humanity will be then changed into something nobler, but also that what we have therein to expect is nothing else than that which was at the beginning. In the beginning, we see, it was not an ear rising from a grain, but a grain coming from an ear, and, after that, the ear grows round the grain: and so the order indicated in this similitude[fn-37-P3784_2481922:180-nf] clearly shows that all that blessed state, which arises for us by means of the Resurrection is only a return to our pristine state of grace. We too, in fact, were once in a fashion a full ear[fn-37-P3785_2482161:181-nf] ; but the burning heat of sin withered us up, and then on our dissolution by death the earth received us: but in the spring of the Resurrection she will reproduce this naked grain[fn-37-P3786_2482423:182-nf] of our body in the form of an ear, tall, well-proportioned, and erect, reaching to the heights of heaven, and, for blade and beard, resplendent in incorruption, and with all the other godlike marks. For \"this corruptible must put on incorruption\"; and this incorruption and glory and honour and power are those distinct and acknowledged marks of Deity which once belonged to him who was created in God's image, and which we hope for hereafter. The first man Adam, that is, was the first ear; but with the arrival of evil human nature was diminished into a mere multitude[fn-37-P3787_2485432:183-nf] ; and, as happens to the grain[fn-37-P3788_2485769:184-nf] on the ear, each individual man was denuded of the beauty of that primal ear, and mouldered in the soil: but in the Resurrection we are born again in our original splendour; only instead of that single primitive ear we become the countless myriads of ears in the cornfields. The virtuous life as contrasted with that of vice is distinguished thus: those who while living have by virtuous conduct exercised husbandry on themselves are at once revealed in all the qualities of a perfect ear, while those whose bare grain (that is the forces of their natural soul) has become through evil habits degenerate, as it were, and hardened by the weather (as the so-called \"hornstruck\" seeds[fn-37-P3789_2486568:185-nf] , according to the experts in such things, grow up), will, though they live again in the Resurrection, experience very great severity from their Judge, because they do not possess the strength to shoot up into the full proportions of an ear, and thereby become that which we were before our earthly fall[fn-37-P3790_2487708:186-nf] . The remedy offered by the Overseer of the produce is to collect together the tares and the thorns, which have grown up with the good seed, and into whose bastard life all the secret forces that once nourished its root have passed, so that it not only has had to remain without its nutriment, but has been choked and so rendered unproductive by this unnatural growth. When from the nutritive part within them everything that is the reverse or the counterfeit of it has been picked out, and has been committed to the fire that consumes everything unnatural, and so has disappeared, then in this class also their humanity will thrive and will ripen into fruit-bearing, owing to such husbandry, and some day after long courses of ages will get back again that universal form which God stamped upon us at the beginning. Blessed are they, indeed, in whom the full beauty of those ears shall be developed directly they are born in the Resurrection. Yet we say this without implying that any merely bodily distinctions will be manifest between those who have lived virtuously and those who have lived viciously in this life, as if we ought to think that one will be imperfect as regards his material frame, while another will win perfection as regards it. The prisoner and the free, here in this present world, are just alike as regards the constitutions of their two bodies; though as regards enjoyment and suffering the gulf is wide between them. In this way, I take it, should we reckon the difference between the good and the bad in that intervening time[fn-37-P3791_2489680:187-nf] . For the perfection of bodies that rise from that sowing of death is, as the Apostle tells us, to consist in incorruption and glory and honour and power; but any diminution in such excellences does not denote a corresponding bodily mutilation of him who has risen again, but a withdrawal and estrangement from each one of those things which are conceived of as belonging to the good. Seeing, then, that one or the other of these two diametrically opposed ideas, I mean good and evil, must any way attach to us, it is clear that to say a man is not included in the good is a necessary demonstration that he is included in the evil. But then, in connection with evil, we find no honour, no glory, no incorruption, no power; and so we are forced to dismiss all doubt that a man who has nothing to do with these last-mentioned things must be connected with their opposites, viz. with weakness, with dishonour, with corruption, with everything of that nature, such as we spoke of in the previous parts of the discussion, when we said how many were the passions, sprung from evil, which are so hard for the soul to get rid of, when they have infused themselves into the very substance of its entire nature and become one with it. When such, then, have been purged from it and utterly removed by the healing processes worked out by the Fire, then every one of the things which make up our conception of the good will come to take their place; incorruption, that is, and life, and honour, and grace, and glory, and everything else that we conjecture is to be seen in God, and in His Image, man as he was made.

Whence it follows that you ought to know what is being done in things sacred in the church of Rome, in order that, by following her example, ye may be found to be true children of her who is called your mother. Accordingly, as we have received the institution from our fathers, we maintain seven deacons in the city of Rome distributed over seven districts of the state, who attend to the services enjoined on them week by week, and on the Lord's days and the solemn festivals, in concert with the subdeacons, and acolytes, and servants of the succeeding orders, and hold themselves in readiness every hour for religious duty, and for the discharge of all that is enjoined upon them. In like manner ought ye also to do throughout your different cities, as may be convenient, that religious duty may be discharged zealously and regularly, without any delay or negligence. Furthermore, we have ordained in like manner seven subdeacons who shall stand by (imminerent) the seven notaries, and bring into one full and accurate account the histories of the martyrs, and lay them before us for our examination. And this, too, we urge you all to do, so that no doubt or questioning of these things may arise in later times; \"for whatsoever things were written, were written for our learning.\"[fn-91-P9195_2985560:1-nf] And whatsoever things are written in truth in our times, are directed to the learning of future times. And therefore we enjoin these duties to be put in charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be found in them, from which an offence (which may God forbid) may arise to the faithful. For this reason also we beg it of your love in paternal benignity, that the holy Church may now find the good-will of your love in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour whenever there is necessity. And as the goodness of your zeal affords us the assurance that we ought to distrust it in nothing, but rather commit these things in all confidence to you as to wise sons of our church; so, small importance being attached to opportune occasions, your virtue ought to exert itself the more strenuously in labours, and keep off reproaches by all possible means, and with all zeal. We exhort you also, according to the word of the apostle, to be \"stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not vain in the Lord.\"[fn-91-P9196_2986656:2-nf] And in another place: \"Watch ye, and pray, and stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men, and be strong. Let all things be done with charity.\"[fn-91-P9197_2986818:3-nf] Furthermore, we desire you to know this, that in our times, as our sins embarrassed us, and that ancient enemy who always goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,[fn-91-P9198_2987024:4-nf] instigated him, Novatus came up out of Africa, and separated Novatianus and certain other confessors of Christ from the Church of Christ, and persuaded them into the acceptance of evil doctrine. From such persons, brethren, keep yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a faith and doctrine different from that which the apostles and their successors have held and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going after him ye fall into the toils of Satan, and be bound with his fetters. Wherefore with most earnest prayers we beg it of your brotherly love, that ye may deem it fit to remember our insignificance in your holy prayers, beseeching and entreating the Lord of heaven that we, as well as our holy mother the Church of Christ, redeemed with His precious blood, may be delivered from the toils of Satan, who lieth in wait for us; and from troublesome and wicked men, and that the Word of God may have free course and be glorified, and that the evil doctrine of them, and of all who teach things contrary to the truth, may be overthrown and perish. We beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious supplications, that our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all men to be saved, and no one to perish,[fn-91-P9199_2988263:5-nf] may, by His vast omnipotence, cause their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the Catholic faith, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the devil who are held captive by him, and be united with the children of our mother the Church. Be mindful also of your brethren, and have pity upon them, and labour for them by all means in your power, that they be not lost, but be saved unto the Lord by your prayers, and other efforts of your goodness. So act therefore in these matters that ye may approve yourselves as obedient and faithful children of the holy Church of God, and that ye may obtain the recompense of reward. These men, and all else who do not teach the true doctrine, and hold not the true faith, cannot act as accusers of any true believer, because they are branded with infamy, and are cut off from the bosom of our holy mother the Church by the sword of the apostles, until their return to correct conversation and belief. Hence by apostolic authority, and in agreement with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal Church, we resolve that all who come under suspicion with respect to the Catholic faith cannot be admitted as accusers of those who hold the true creed; for suspicions are always to be set aside. Rightly therefore are charges which are preferred by those who are objects of suspicion in the matter of the true faith, rejected. Neither are they at all to be credited who are unacquainted with the faith of the Trinity. In like manner we set aside and withdraw from all part in the accusing of the faithful, all those whom the decrees of the holy fathers in times past and times future alike anathematize. Accordingly, the believing ought always to be kept distinct from the unbelieving, and the righteous from the unrighteous; since the unbelieving and evil-minded, by every means in their power, are always troubling the believing, and striving to undo them; and consequently they are not to be received, but rejected and kept entirely at a distance, lest they may undo or defame the believing. For this reason, dearly beloved, beware of the pit of such persons, into which we know many have fallen. Beware of the snares (or darts) of such persons, and of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by which we have seen even those closely connected with us fall wounded before us. Watch the nooses of the liers in wait, by which they are wont to strangle associates and comrades. Follow not such, but keep them far off from you. Be ye, according to the voice of Truth, wise as serpents and harmless as doves.[fn-92-P9200_2990844:6-nf] See to it that ye neither run nor labour in vain; but, sustained by each other's prayers and supplications, strive ye to do the will of God; and from those persons whom I have mentioned, if they show themselves incorrigible, keep yourselves separate in all things. In like manner keep yourselves separate from all those of whom the apostle makes mention when he says, \"with such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9201_2991266:7-nf] since these latter, as well as the former, are to be rejected, and are not to be admitted before they have given satisfaction to the Church. For those with whom it is not lawful to eat are manifestly separated from all intercourse with the rest of the brethren until such satisfaction is given. Wherefore they ought not and cannot be admitted to the preferring of charges against the faithful, but they ought to be debarred from their society until the satisfaction already mentioned is given, lest these too should be made like them, or underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have the apostles decreed, saying, With the excommunicated no fellowship is to be held. And if any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings with the excommunicated in his house, or speaks or prays in company with them, that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion. Such persons, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are not to be received, because, according to the apostle, not only those who commit such things are condemned, but also those who consent with those who do them.[fn-92-P9202_2992387:8-nf] Whence also the blessed chief of the apostles, Peter, addressing the people at the ordination of Clement, says this among other things:[fn-92-P9203_2992538:9-nf] If this Clement is hostile to any one on account of his deeds, wait not ye for his saying directly to you, Be not on terms of friendship with this man. But mark ye carefully his will as ye ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and separate yourselves from that man to whom ye perceive him to be inimical, and speak not with those with whom he speaks not, in order that every one who may be in fault, as he desires to possess the friendship of all of you, may be zealous in effecting a reconciliation all the more quickly with him who presides over all, so that be may return to spiritual well-being (redeat et salutem) hereby, when he begins to yield obedience to the charges of the president.","title":"The First Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":15,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_130_the_first_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-08","text":"If, however, any one is not friendly, and speaks with those with whom he (his chief) speaks not, such an one belongs to those who seek to exterminate the Church of God; and though he seems to be with you in body, he is against you in mind and heart.

For this man under the guise of friendship acts the part of an enemy, and scatters and ruins the church. And therefore, dearly beloved, in these apostolic institutes we warn and teach you, that your charity, being instructed therein (effecta certior), may hereafter study to act with greater care and prudence, so that perverse and unbelieving men may not have the power of injuring the faithful and well-disposed; for the hope of such, and of all the ungodly, is like dust that is blown away with the wind; and like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; and like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and as the remembrance of a guest of a single day that passeth away.[fn-92-P9205_2994374:10-nf] With the utmost care, dearly beloved, are such persons to be guarded against, and avoided, and rejected, if they show themselves injurious.

And lest this pest may be spread abroad more widely, let us cut it off from us with all possible severity; for the temerity of presumption does not intervene where there is the diligence of piety. Let every one of you, sustained by this apostolic representation, act according to his strength, and study in brotherly love and in godly piety to keep his own manners correct, and to help each other, and to abide in charity, and to keep himself in the will of God unceasingly, in order that we may praise the Lord together, and give Him thanks always without wearying.

That it may appear more clearly, then, whether bodily matter can exist during intervals of time, and whether, as it did not exist before it was made, so it may again be resolved into non-existence, let us see, first of all, whether it is possible for any one to live without a body. For if one person can live without a body, all things also may dispense with them; seeing our former treatise has shown that all things tend towards one end. Now, if all things may exist without bodies, there will undoubtedly be no bodily substance, seeing there will be no use for it. But how shall we understand the words of the apostle in those passages, in which, discussing the resurrection of the dead, he says, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. When this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory! Where, O death, is thy victory? O death, thy sting has been swallowed up: the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.\"[fn-64-P6493_1257511:12-nf] Some such meaning, then, as this, seems to be suggested by the apostle. For can the expression which he employs, \"this corruptible,\" and \"this mortal,\" with the gesture, as it were, of one who touches or points out, apply to anything else than to bodily matter? This matter of the body, then, which is now corruptible shall put on incorruption when a perfect soul, and one furnished with the marks[fn-64-P6494_1257967:13-nf] of incorruption, shall have begun to inhabit it. And do not be surprised if we speak of a perfect soul as the clothing of the body (which, on account of the Word of God and His wisdom, is now named incorruption), when Jesus Christ Himself, who is the Lord and Creator of the soul, is said to be the clothing of the saints, according to the language of the apostle, \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-64-P6495_1258495:14-nf] As Christ, then, is the clothing of the soul, so for a kind of reason sufficiently intelligible is the soul said to be the clothing of the body, seeing it is an ornament to it, covering and concealing its mortal nature. The expression, then, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption,\" is as if the apostle had said, \"This corruptible nature of the body must receive the clothing of incorruption-a soul possessing in itself incorruptibitity,\" because it has been clothed with Christ, who is the Wisdom and Word of God. But when this body, which at some future period we shall possess in a more glorious state, shall have become a partaker of life, it will then, in addition to being immortal, become also incorruptible. For whatever is mortal is necessarily also corruptible; but whatever is corruptible cannot also be said to be mortal. We say of a stone or a piece of wood that it is corruptible, but we do not say that it follows that it is also mortal. But as the body partakes of life, then because life may be, and is, separated from it, we consequently name it mortal, and according to another sense also we speak of it as corruptible. The holy apostle therefore, with remarkable insight, referring to the general first cause of bodily matter, of which (matter), whatever be the qualities with which it is endowed (now indeed carnal, but by and by more refined and pure, which are termed spiritual), the soul makes constant use, says, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption.\" And in the second place, looking to the special cause of the body, he says, \"This mortal must put on immortality.\" Now, what else will in-corruption and immortality be, save the wisdom, and the word, and the righteousness of God, which mould; and clothe, and adorn the soul?

And why should I repeat and enumerate all the horrors of human misery, from which some have been free, and in which others have been involved, when each one can weigh and consider them for himself?

But now, also, for the sake of logical order in our treatise, there will be no absurdity in restating a few points from such works, especially since some take offence at the creed of the Church, as if our belief in the resurrection were foolish, and altogether devoid of sense; and these are principally heretics, who, I think, are to be answered in the following manner. If they also admit that there is a resurrection of the dead, let them answer us this, What is that which died? Was it not a body? It is of the body, then, that there will be a resurrection. Let them next tell us if they think that we are to make use of bodies or not. I think that when the Apostle Paul says, that \"it is sown a natural body, it will arise a spiritual body,\"[fn-67-P6711_1382285:173-nf] they cannot deny that it is a body which arises, or that in the resurrection we are to make use of bodies.

If it is certain that we are to make use of bodies, and if the bodies which have fallen are declared to rise again (for only that which before has fallen can be properly said to rise again), it can be a matter of doubt to no one that they rise again, in order that we may be clothed with them a second time at the resurrection. The one thing is closely connected with the other. For if bodies rise again, they undoubtedly rise to be coverings for us; and if it is necessary for us to be invested with bodies, as it is certainly necessary, we ought to be invested with no other than our own. But if it is true that these rise again, and that they arise \"spiritual\" bodies, there can be no doubt that they are said to rise from the dead, after casting away corruption and laying aside mortality; otherwise it will appear vain and superfluous for any one to arise from the dead in order to die a second time. And this, finally, may be more distinctly comprehended thus, if one carefully consider what are the qualities of an animal body, which, when sown into the earth, recovers the qualities of a spiritual body. For it is out of the animal body that the very power and grace of the resurrection educe the spiritual body, when it transmutes it from a condition of indignity to one of glory.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":15,"verse":39,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-04","text":"2.

For no one will deny this, save him who is altogether without any learning. But if, as a matter of course, they say that every body is certainly fashioned according to some definite shape, we shall ask them if they can point out and describe to us the shape of a spiritual body; a thing which they can by no means do.

Our understanding of the passage indeed is, that the apostle, wishing to describe the great difference among those who rise again in glory, i.e., of the saints, borrowed a comparison from the heavenly bodies, saying, \"One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, another the glory of the stars.\" And wishing again to teach us the differences among those who shall come to the resurrection, without having purged themselves in this life, i.e., sinners, he borrowed an illustration from earthly things, saying, \"There is one flesh of birds, another of fishes.\" For heavenly things are worthily compared to the saints, and earthly things to sinners.

But while some of them derive their strength from the starting-point itself from which they take their rise, others, consequent upon the nature and the life of men, acquire their credibility from the superintendence of God over us; for the cause according to which, and on account of which, men have come into being, being closely connected with the nature of men, derives its force from creation; but the argument from rectitude, which represents God as judging men according as they have lived well or ill, derives its force from the end of their existence: they come into being on the former ground, but their state depends more on God's superintendence. And now that the matters which come first have been demonstrated by me to the best of my ability, it will be well to prove our proposition by those also which come after-I mean by the reward or punishment due to each man in accordance with righteous judgment, and by the final cause of human existence; and of these I put foremost that which takes the lead by nature, and inquire first into the argument relating to the judgment: premising only one thing, from concern for the principle which appertains to the matters before us, and for order-namely, that it is incumbent on those who admit God to be the Maker of this universe, to ascribe to His wisdom and rectitude the preservation and care of all that has been created if they wish to keep to their own principles; and with such views to hold that nothing either in earth or in heaven is without guardianship or providence, but that; on the contrary, to everything, invisible and visible alike, small and great, the attention of the Creator reaches; for all created things require the attention of the Creator,[fn-26-P2608_745198:11-nf] and each one in particular, according to its nature and the end for which it was made: though I think it would be a useless expenditure of trouble to go through the list now, or distinguish between the several cases, or mention in detail what is suitable to each nature. Man, at all events, of whom it is now our business to speak, as being in want, requires food; as being mortal, posterity; as being rational, a process of judgment. But if each of these things belongs to man by nature, and he requires food for his life, and requires posterity for the continuance of the race, and requires a judgment in order that food and posterity may be according to law, it of course follows, since food and posterity refer to both together, that the judgment must be referred to them too (by both together I mean man, consisting of soul and body), and that such man becomes accountable for all his actions, and receives for them either reward or punishment. Now, if the righteous judgment awards to both together its retribution for the deeds wrought; and if it is not proper that either the soul alone should receive the wages of the deeds wrought in union with the body (for this of itself has no inclination to the faults which are committed in connection with the pleasure or food and culture of the body), or that the body alone should (for this of itself is incapable of distinguishing law and justice), but man, composed of these, is subjected to trial for each of the deeds wrought by him; and if reason does not find this happening either in this life (for the award according to merit finds no place in the present existence, since many atheists and persons who practise every iniquity and wickedness live on to the last, unvisited by calamity, whilst, on the contrary, those who have manifestly lived an exemplary life in respect of every Virtue, live in pain, in insult, in calumny and outrage, and suffering of all kinds) or after death (for both together no longer exist, the soul being separated from the body, and the body itself being resolved again into the materials out of which it was composed, and no longer retaining anything of its former structure or form, much less the remembrance of its actions): the result of all this is very plain to every one,-namely, that, in the language of the apostle, \"this corruptible (and dissoluble) must put on incorruption,\"[fn-26-P2609_747649:12-nf] in order that those who were dead, having been made alive by the resurrection, and the parts that were separated and entirely dissolved having been again united, each one may, in accordance with justice, receive what he has done by the body, whether it be good or bad.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Dead","author":"Writings of Athenagoras"},{"chapter":15,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":44,"source_paragraph":"142","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But the descent into the water, and the trine immersion of the person in it, involves another mystery. For since the method of our salvation was made effectual not so much by His precepts in the way of teaching[fn-40-P4031_2670185:92-nf] as by the deeds of Him Who has realized an actual fellowship with man, and has effected life as a living fact, so that by means of the flesh which He has assumed, and at the same time deified[fn-40-P4032_2670713:93-nf] , everything kindred and related may be saved along with it, it was necessary that some means should be devised by which there might be, in the baptismal process, a kind of affinity and likeness between him who follows and Him Who leads the way. Needful, therefore, is it to see what features are to be observed in the Author of our life, in order that the imitation on the part of those that follow may be regulated, as the Apostle says, after the pattern of the Captain of our salvation[fn-40-P4033_2674567:94-nf] . For, as it is they who are actually drilled into measured and orderly movements in arms by skilled drill-masters, who are advanced to dexterity in handling their weapons by what they see with their eyes, whereas he who does not practise what is shown him remains devoid of such dexterity, in the same way it is imperative on all those who have an equally earnest desire for the Good as He has, to be followers by the path of an exact imitation of Him Who leads the way to salvation, and to carry into action what He has shown them. It is, in fact, impossible for persons to reach the same goal unless they travel by the same ways. For as persons who are at a loss how to thread the turns of mazes, when they happen to fall in with some one who has experience of them, get to the end of those various misleading turnings in the chambers by following him behind, which they could not do, did they not follow him their leader step by step, so too, I pray you mark, the labyrinth of this our life cannot be threaded by the faculties of human nature unless a man pursues that same path as He did Who, though once in it, yet got beyond the difficulties which hemmed Him in. I apply this figure of a labyrinth to that prison of death, which is without an egress[fn-40-P4034_2675856:95-nf] and environs the wretched race of mankind. What, then, have we beheld in the case of the Captain of our salvation? A three days' state of death and then life again. Now some sort of resemblance in us to such things has to be planned. What, then, is the plan by which in us too a resemblance to that which took place in Him is completed? Everything that is affected by death has its proper and natural place, and that is the earth in which it is laid and hidden. Now earth and water have much mutual affinity. Alone of the elements they have weight and gravitate downwards; they mutually abide in each other; they are mutually confined. Seeing, then, the death of the Author of our life subjected Him to burial in earth and was in accord with our common nature, the imitation which we enact of that death is expressed in the neighbouring element. And as He, that Man from above[fn-40-P4035_2676853:96-nf] , having taken deadness on Himself, after His being deposited in the earth, returned back to life the third day, so every one who is knitted to Him by virtue of his bodily form, looking forward to the same successful issue, I mean this arriving at life by having, instead of earth, water poured on him[fn-40-P4036_2677214:97-nf] , and so submitting to that element, has represented for him in the three movements the three-days-delayed grace of the resurrection. Something like this has been said in what has gone before, namely, that by the Divine providence death has been introduced as a dispensation into the nature of man, so that, sin having flowed away at the dissolution of the union of soul and body, man, through the resurrection, might be refashioned, sound, passionless, stainless, and removed from any touch of evil. In the case however of the Author of our Salvation this dispensation of death reached its fulfilment, having entirely accomplished its special purpose. For in His death, not only were things that once were one put asunder, but also things that had been disunited were again brought together; so that in this dissolution of things that had naturally grown together, I mean, the soul and body, our nature might be purified, and this return to union of these severed elements might secure freedom from the contamination of any foreign admixture. But as regards those who follow this Leader, their nature does not admit of an exact and entire imitation, but it receives now as much as it is capable of receiving, while it reserves the remainder for the time that comes after. In what, then, does this imitation consist? It consists in the effecting the suppression of that admixture of sin, in the figure of mortification that is given by the water, not certainly a complete effacement, but a kind of break in the continuity of the evil, two things concurring to this removal of sin-the penitence of the transgressor and his imitation of the death. By these two things the man is in a measure freed from his congenital tendency to evil; by his penitence he advances to a hatred of and averseness from sin, and by his death he works out the suppression of the evil. But had it been possible for him in his imitation to undergo a complete dying, the result would be not imitation but identity; and the evil of our nature would so entirely vanish that, as the Apostle says, \"he would die unto sin once for all[fn-40-P4037_2679445:98-nf] .\" But since, as has been said, we only so far imitate the transcendent Power as the poverty of our nature is capable of, by having the water thrice poured on us and ascending again up from the water, we enact that saving burial and resurrection which took place on the third day, with this thought in our mind, that as we have power over the water both to be in it and arise out of it, so He too, Who has the universe at His sovereign disposal, immersed Himself in death, as we in the water, to return[fn-40-P4038_2680030:99-nf] to His own blessedness. If, therefore, one looks to that which is in reason, and judges of the results according to the power inherent in either party, one will discover no disproportion in these results, each in proportion to the measure of his natural power working out the effects that are within his reach. For, as it is in the power of man, if he is so disposed, to touch the water and yet be safe, with infinitely greater ease may death be handled by the Divine Power so as to be in it and yet not to be changed by it injuriously. Observe, then, that it is necessary for us to rehearse beforehand in the water the grace of the resurrection, to the intent that we may understand that, as far as facility goes, it is the same thing for us to be baptized with water and to rise again from death. But as in matters that concern our life here, there are some which take precedence of others, as being those without which the result could not be achieved, although if the beginning be compared with the end, the beginning so contrasted will seem of no account (for what equality, for instance, is there between the man and that which is laid as a foundation for the constitution of his animal being? And yet if that had never been, neither would this be which we see), in like manner that which happens in the great resurrection, essentially vaster though it be, has its beginnings and its causes here; it is not, in fact, possible that that should take place, unless this had gone before; I mean, that without the laver of regeneration it is impossible for the man to be in the resurrection; but in saying this I do not regard the mere remoulding and refashioning of our composite body; for towards this it is absolutely necessary that human nature should advance, being constrained thereto by its own laws according to the dispensation of Him Who has so ordained, whether it have received the grace of the laver, or whether it remains without that initiation: but I am thinking of the restoration to a blessed and divine condition, separated from all shame and sorrow. For not everything that is granted in the resurrection a return to existence will return to the same kind of life. There is a wide interval between those who have been purified, and those who still need purification. For those in whose life-time here the purification by the laver has preceded, there is a restoration to a kindred state. Now, to the pure, freedom from passion is that kindred state, and that in this freedom from passion blessedness consists, admits of no dispute. But as for those whose weaknesses have become inveterate[fn-40-P4039_2682686:100-nf] , and to whom no purgation of their defilement has been applied, no mystic water, no invocation of the Divine power, no amendment by repentance, it is absolutely necessary that they should come to be in something proper to their case,-just as the furnace is the proper thing for gold alloyed with dross,-in order that, the vice which has been mixed up in them being melted away after long succeeding ages, their nature may be restored pure again to God. Since, then, there is a cleansing virtue in fire and water, they who by the mystic water have washed away the defilement of their sin have no further need of the other form of purification, while they who have not been admitted to that form of purgation must needs be purified by fire.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":15,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_42_homily_xxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Let us not then any more bring in such old wives' doctrines, and Jewish fables.

But as for those things in which he is found to contradict himself, I will point out how this has come to pass in a few words which I have added at the close of this Preface. As for us, we believe what has been delivered to us by the holy Prophets, namely: that the holy Trinity is coeternal, and is of one power and substance: and that the Son of God in these last days was made man and suffered for our sins, and, in that very flesh in which he suffered, rose from the dead; and thereby imparted the hope of a resurrection to the whole race of men. When we speak of the resurrection of the flesh, we do so not with any subterfuges, as some slanderously affirm: we believe that the flesh which is to rise isthis very flesh in which we now live: we do not put one thing for another, nor when we say body, mean something different from this flesh. If, therefore, we saythat the body is to rise again, we speak as the Apostle spoke; for this word body was the word which he employed: Or if, again, we speak of the flesh, our confession coin tides with the words of the creed. It is a foolish and calumnious invention to imagine that the human body can be anything but flesh. Whether, then, we say that it is flesh according to the common faith, or body according to the Apostle, which is to rise again, our belief must be held, according to the definition given by the Apostle, with the understanding that that which is to rise again is to be raised inpower and in glory, an incorruptible and a spiritual body. While, therefore, we maintain the superior excellence of the body or flesh which is to be, we must hold that the flesh which rises again will be real and perfect; the actual nature of the flesh will be preserved, while the glorious condition of the uncorrupted and spiritual body will not be impaired. For so it is written:[fn-86-P8642_2165249:26-nf] \"Corruption shall not inherit incorruption.\" This is what is preached at jerusalem in the church of God, by its reverend bishop John: this is what we with him confess and hold.

We are not, however, to suppose that each individual has to contend against all these (adversaries). For it is impossible for any man, although he were a saint, to carry on a contest against all of them at the same time. If that indeed were by any means to be the case, as it is certainly impossible it should be so, human nature could not possibly bear it without undergoing entire destruction.[fn-71-P7154_1578414:302-nf] But as, for example, if fifty soldiers were to say that they were about to engage with fifty others, they would not be understood to mean that one of them had to contend against the whole fifty, but each one would rightly say that \"our battle was against fifty,\" all against all; so also this is to be understood as the apostle's meaning, that all the athletes and soldiers of Christ have to wrestle and struggle against all the adversaries enumerated,-the struggle having, indeed, to be maintained against all, but by single individuals either with individual powers, or at least in such manner as shall be determined by God, who is the just president of the struggle. For I am of opinion that there is a certain limit to the powers of human nature, although there may be a Paul, of whom it is said, \"He is a chosen vessel unto Me; \"[fn-71-P7155_1579286:303-nf] or a Peter, against whom the gates of hell do not prevail; or a Moses, the friend of God: yet not one of them could sustain, without destruction to himself,[fn-71-P7156_1579463:304-nf] the whole simultaneous assault of these opposing powers, unless indeed the might of Him alone were to work in him, who said, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"[fn-71-P7157_1579668:305-nf] And therefore Paul exclaims with confidence, \"I can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me; \"[fn-71-P7158_1579795:306-nf] and again, \"I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\"[fn-71-P7159_1579922:307-nf] On account, then, of this power, which certainly is not of human origin operating and speaking in him, Paul could say, \"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor power, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"[fn-71-P7160_1580342:308-nf] For I do not think that human nature can alone of itself maintain a contest with angels, and with the powers of the height and of the abyss,[fn-71-P7161_1580666:309-nf] and with any other creature; but when it feels the presence of the Lord dwelling within it, confidence in the divine help will lead it to say, \"The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the enemies draw near to me, to eat my flesh, my enemies who trouble me, they stumbled and fell. Though an host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in Him shall I be confident.\"[fn-71-P7162_1581188:310-nf] From which I infer that a man perhaps would never be able of himself to vanquish an opposing power, unless he had the benefit of divine assistance. Hence, also, the angel is said to have wrestled with Jacob. Here, however, I understand the writer to mean, that it was not the same thing for the angel to have wrestled with Jacob, and to have wrestled against him; but the angel that wrestles with him is he who was present with him in order to secure his safety, who, after knowing also his moral progress, gave him in addition the name of Israel, i.e., he is with him in the struggle, and assists him in the contest; seeing there was undoubtedly another angel against whom he contended, and against whom he had to carry on a contest. Finally, Paul has not said that we wrestle with princes, or with powers, but against principalities and powers. And hence, although Jacob wrestled, it was unquestionably against some one of those powers which, Paul declares, resist and contend with the human race, and especially with the saints. And therefore at last the Scripture says of him that \"he wrestled with the angel, and had power with God,\" so that the struggle is supported by help of the angel, but the prize of success conducts the conqueror to God.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"ANF-04","text":"7. I know not, indeed, how the heretics, not understanding the meaning of the apostle in these words, consider the term[fn-72-P7277_1639039:394-nf] \"subjection\" degrading as applied to the Son; for if the propriety of the title be called in question, it may easily be ascertained from making a contrary supposition. Because if it be not good to be in subjection, it follows that the opposite will be good, viz., not to be in subjection. Now the language of the apostle, according to their view, appears to indicate by these words, \"And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him,\"[fn-72-P7278_1639579:395-nf] that He, who is not now in subjection to the Father, will become subject to Him when the Father shall have first subdued all things unto Him. But I am astonished how it can be conceived to be the meaning, that He who, while all things are not yet subdued to Him, is not Himself in subjection, should-at a time when all things have been subdued to Him, and when He has become King of all men, and holds sway over all things-be supposed then to be made subject, seeing He was not formerly in subjection; for such do not understand that the subjection of Christ to the Father indicates that our happiness has attained to perfection, and that the work undertaken by Him has been brought to a victorious termination, seeing He has not only purified the power of supreme government over the whole of creation, but presents to the Father the principles of the obedience and subjection of the human race in a corrected and improved condition.[fn-72-P7279_1640536:396-nf] If, then, that subjection be held to be good and salutary by which the Son is said to be subject to the Father, it is an extremely rational and logical inference to deduce that the subjection also of enemies, which is said to be made to the Son of God, should be understood as being also salutary and useful; as if, when the Son is said to be subject to the Father, the perfect restoration of the whole of creation is signified, so also, when enemies are said to be subjected to the Son of God, the salvation of the conquered and the restoration of the lost is in that understood to consist.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-04","text":"6. Into this condition, then, we are to suppose that all this bodily substance of ours will be brought, when all things shall be re-established in a state of unity, and when God shall be all in all. And this result must be understood as being brought about, not suddenly, but slowly and gradually, seeing that the process of amendment and correction will take place imperceptibly in the individual instances during the lapse of countless and unmeasured ages, some outstripping others, and tending by a swifter course towards perfection,[fn-73-P7310_1660994:418-nf] while others again follow close at hand, and some again a long way behind; and thus, through the numerous and uncounted orders of progressive beings who are being reconciled to God from a state of enmity, the last enemy is finally reached, who is called death, so that he also may be destroyed, and no longer be an enemy. When, therefore, all rational souls shall have been restored to a condition of this kind, then the nature of this body of ours will undergo a change into the glory of a spiritual body. For as we see it not to be the case with rational natures, that some of them have lived in a condition of degradation owing to their sins, while others have been called to a state of happiness on account of their merits; but as we see those same souls who had formerly been sinful, assisted, after their conversion and reconciliation to God, to a state of happiness; so also are we to consider, with respect to the nature of the body, that the one which we now make use of in a state of meanness, and corruption, and weakness, is not a different body from that which we shall possess in incorruption, and in power, and in glory; but that the same body, when it has cast away the infirmities in which it is now entangled, shall be transmuted into a condition of glory, being rendered spiritual, so that what was a vessel of dishonour may, when cleansed, become a vessel unto honour, and an abode of blessedness. And in this condition, also, we are to believe, that by the will of the Creator, it will abide for ever without any change, as is confirmed by the declaration of the apostle, when he says, \"We have a house, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\" For the faith of the Church[fn-73-P7311_1662710:419-nf] does not admit the view of certain Grecian philosophers, that there is besides the body, composed of four elements, another fifth body, which is different in all its parts, and diverse from this our present body; since neither out of sacred Scripture can any produce the slightest suspicion of evidence for such an opinion, nor can any rational inference from things allow the reception of it, especially when the holy apostle manifestly declares, that it is not new bodies which are given to those who rise from the dead, but that they receive those identical ones which they had possessed when living, transformed from an inferior into a better condition. For his words are: \"It is sown an animal body, it will rise a spiritual body; it is sown in corruption, it will arise in incorruption: it is sown in weakness, it will arise in power: it is sown in dishonour, it will arise in glory.\"[fn-73-P7312_1663626:420-nf] As, therefore, there is a kind of advance in man, so that from being first an animal being, and not understanding what belongs to the Spirit of God, he reaches by means of instruction the stage of being made a spiritual being, and of judging all things, while he himself is judged by no one; so also, with respect to the state of the body, we are to hold that this very body which now, on account of its service to the soul, is styled an animal body, will, by means of a certain progress, when the soul, united to God, shall have been made one spirit with Him (the body even then ministering, as it were, to the spirit), attain to a spiritual condition and quality, especially since, as we have often pointed out, bodily nature was so formed by the Creator, as to pass easily into whatever condition he should wish, or the nature of the case demand.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":15,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_29_sermon_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"7.

Among these Apostles was Paul, as it were the border, the least and last; as he saith himself, \"I am the least of the Apostles.\"[fn-36-P3614_1574406:18-nf] In a garment the last and least thing is the border.

Dost thou dare deny that Christ is God? Hast thou learned this other doctrine, when thou didst sit at meat in the idol's temple? The school of Christ doth not admit that doctrine.

So also is the resurrection of the dead.[fn-46-P4661_1569648:30-nf] Therefore know that, even when men shall enter\ninto life, yet reward shall excel reward, and glory shall excel glory, and recompense shall excel\nrecompense. Degree is higher than degree; and light is more goodly than light in aspect. The sun\nexcels the moon, and the moon is greater than the stars that are with her. And observe that the moon\nand the stars are also under the power of the sun, and their light is swallowed up in the splendour\nof the sun. And the sun has power along with the moon and the stars, that he may not abolish the\nnight which has been separated from the day. And when the sun was created, he was called a luminary.\nAnd observe that the sun and the moon and the stars are all called luminaries; but luminary excels\nluminary. The sun obscures the light of the moon, and the moon likewise darkens the light of the\nstars; and star excels star in its light.","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"},{"chapter":15,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_49_on_baptism_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"Well, but the nations, who are strangers to all understanding of spiritual powers, ascribe to their idols the imbuing of waters with the self-same efficacy.\" (So they do) but they cheat themselves with waters which are widowed.[fn-115-P11511_3256387:28-nf] For washing is the channel through which they are initiated into some sacred rites-of some notorious Isis or Mithras. The gods themselves likewise they honour by washings. Moreover, by carrying water around, and sprinkling it, they everywhere expiate[fn-115-P11512_3256726:29-nf] country-seats, houses, temples, and whole cities: at all events, at the Apollinarian and Eleusinian games they are baptized; and they presume that the effect of their doing that is their regeneration and the remission of the penalties due to their perjuries. Among the ancients, again, whoever had defiled himself with murder, was wont to go in quest of purifying waters. Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that it is the appropriate material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves with a belief in omens of purification, how much more truly will waters render that service through the authority of God, by whom all their nature has been constituted! If men think that water is endued with a medicinal virtue by religion, what religion is more effectual than that of the living God? Which fact being acknowledged, we recognise here also the zeal of the devil rivalling the things of God,[fn-115-P11513_3257652:30-nf] while we find him, too, practising baptism in his subjects. What similarity is there? The unclean cleanses! the ruiner sets free! the damned absolves! He will, forsooth, destroy his own work, by washing away the sins which himself inspires! These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony against such as reject the faith; if they put no trust in the things of God, the spurious imitations of which, in the case of God's rival, they do trust in. Are there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding[fn-115-P11514_3258269:31-nf] of the Divine Spirit in the very beginning? Witness all shady founts, and all unfrequented brooks, and the ponds in the baths, and the conduits[fn-115-P11515_3258431:32-nf] in private houses, or the cisterns and wells which are said to have the property of \"spiriting away,\"[fn-115-P11516_3258546:33-nf] through the power, that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned[fn-115-P11517_3258637:34-nf] or affected with madness or with fear, they call nymph-caught,[fn-115-P11518_3258717:35-nf] or \"lymphatic,\" or\" hydro-phobic.\" Why have we adduced these instances? Lest any think it too hard for belief that a holy angel of God should grant his presence to waters, to temper them to man's salvation; while the evil angel holds frequent profane commerce with the selfsame element to man's ruin. If it seems a novelty for an angel to be present in waters, an example of what was to come to pass has forerun. An angel, by his intervention, was wont to stir the pool at Bethsaida.[fn-115-P11519_3259258:36-nf] They who were complaining of ill-health used to watch for him; for whoever had been the first to descend into them, after his washing, ceased to complain. This figure of corporeal healing sang of a spiritual healing, according to the rule by which things carnal are always antecedent[fn-115-P11520_3259728:37-nf] as figurative of things spiritual. And thus, when the grace of God advanced to higher degrees among men,[fn-115-P11521_3259861:38-nf] an accession of efficacy was granted to the waters and to the angel. They who[fn-115-P11522_3259960:39-nf] were wont to remedy bodily defects,[fn-115-P11523_3260034:40-nf] now heal the spirit; they who used to work temporal salvation[fn-115-P11524_3260108:41-nf] now renew eternal; they who did set free but once in the year, now save peoples in a body[fn-115-P11525_3260225:42-nf] daily, death being done away through ablution of sins. The guilt being removed, of course the penalty is removed too. Thus man will be restored for God to His \"likeness,\" who in days bygone had been conformed to \"the image\" of God; (the \"image\" is counted (to be) in his form: the \"likeness\" in his eternity: ) for he receives again that Spirit of God which he had then first received from His afflatus, but had afterward lost through sin.","title":"On Baptism.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_39_book_v_of_the_spirit_of_gluttony_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"For it is an ancient and excellent saying of the blessed Antony[fn-24-P2463_1031263:5-nf] that when a monk is endeavouring after the plan of the monastic life to reach the heights of a more advanced perfection, and, having learned the consideration of discretion, is able now to stand in his own judgment, and to arrive at the very summit of the anchorite's life, he ought by no means to seek for all kinds of virtues from one man however excellent. For one is adorned with flowers of knowledge, another is more strongly fortified with methods of discretion, another is established in the dignity of patience, another excels inthe virtue of humility, another in that of continence, another is decked with the grace of simplicity. This one excels all others in magnanimity, that one in pity, another in vigils, another in silence, another in earnestness of work. And therefore the monk who desires to gather spiritual honey, ought like a most careful bee, to suck out virtue from those who specially possess it, and should diligently store it up in the vessel of his own breast: nor should he investigate what any one is lacking in, but only regard and gather whatever virtue he has. For if we want to gain all virtues from some one person, we shall with great difficulty or perhaps never at all find suitable examples for us to imitate. For though we do not as yet see that even Christ is made \"all things in all,\" as the Apostle says;[fn-24-P2464_1032861:6-nf] still in this way we can find Him bit by bit in all. For it is said of Him, \"Who was made of God to you wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\"[fn-24-P2465_1033044:7-nf] While then in one there is found wisdom, in another righteousness, in another sanctification, in another kindness, in another chastity, in another humility, in another patience, Christ is at the present time divided, member by member, among all of the saints. But when all come together into the unity of the faith and virtue, He is formed into the \"perfect man,\"[fn-24-P2466_1033425:8-nf] completing the fulness of His body, in the joints and properties of all His members. Until then that time arrives when God will be \"all in all,\" for the present God can in the way of which we have spoken be \"in all,\" through particular virtues, although He is not yet \"all in all\" through the fulness of them. For although our religion has but one end and aim, yet there are different ways by which we approach God, as will be more fully shown in the Conferences of the Elders.[fn-24-P2467_1033919:9-nf] And so we must seek a model of discretion and continence more particularly from those from whom we see that those virtues flow forth more abundantly through the grace of the Holy Spirit; not that any one can alone acquire those things which are divided among many, but in order that in those good qualities of which we are capable we may advance towards the imitation of those who especially have acquired them.","title":"Book V.Of the Spirit of Gluttony.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_43_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"I only wonder that he did not add[fn-92-P9243_2482790:5-nf] \"The prisoner of Jesus Christ,\" or \"I was delivered from the jaw of the lion,\" or \"I fought with beasts at Alexandria,\" or \"I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.

For if the flowers were made especially for man, and senseless people have taken them not for their own proper and grateful use, but have abused them to the thankless service of demons, we must keep from them for conscience sake. The crown is the symbol of untroubled tranquillity. For this reason they crown the dead, and idols, too, on the same account, by this fact giving testimony to their being dead. For revellers do not without crowns celebrate their orgies; and when once they are encircled with flowers, at last they are inflamed excessively. We must have no communion with demons. Nor must we crown the living image of God after the manner of dead idols. For the fair crown of amaranth is laid up for those who have lived well. This flower the earth is not able to bear; heaven alone is competent to produce it.[fn-39-P3996_1226226:168-nf] Further, it were irrational in us, who have heard that the Lord was crowned with thorns,[fn-39-P3997_1226442:169-nf] to crown ourselves with flowers, insulting thus the sacred passion of the Lord. For the Lord's crown prophetically pointed to us, who once were barren, but are placed around Him through the Church of which He is the Head. But it is also a type of faith, of life in respect of the substance of the wood, of joy in respect of the appellation of crown, of danger in respect of the thorn, for there is no approaching to the Word without blood. But this platted crown fades, and the plait of perversity is untied, and the flower withers. For the glory of those who have not believed on the Lord fades. And they crowned Jesus raised aloft, testifying to their own ignorance. For being hard of heart, they understood not that this very thing, which they called the disgrace of the Lord, was a prophecy wisely uttered: \"The Lord was not known by the people \"[fn-39-P3998_1227317:170-nf] which erred, which was not circumcised in understanding, whose darkness was not enlightened, which knew not God, denied the Lord, forfeited the place of the true Israel, persecuted God, hoped to reduce the Word to disgrace; and Him whom they crucified as a malefactor they crowned as a king. Wherefore the Man on whom they believed not, they shall know to be the loving God the Lord, the Just. Whom they provoked to show Himself to be the Lord, to Him when lifted up they bore witness, by encircling Him, who is exalted above every name, with the diadem of righteousness by the ever-blooming thorn. This diadem, being hostile to those who plot against Him, coerces them; and friendly to those who form the Church, defends them. This crown is the flower of those who have believed on the glorified One but covers with blood and chastises those who have not believed. It is a symbol, too, of the Lord's successful work, He having borne on His head, the princely part of His body, all our iniquities by which we were pierced. For He by His. own passion rescued us from offences, and sins, and such like thorns; and having destroyed the devil, deservedly said in triumph, \"O Death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-39-P3999_1228536:171-nf] And we eat grapes from thorns, and figs from thistles; while those to whom He stretched forth His hands-the disobedient and unfruitful people-He lacerates into wounds. I can also show you another mystic meaning in it.[fn-40-P4000_1228776:172-nf] For when the Almighty Lord of the universe began to legislate by the Word, and wished His power to be manifested to Moses, a godlike vision of light that had assumed a shape was shown him in the burning bush (the bush is a thorny plant); but when the Word ended the giving of the law and His stay with men, the Lord was again mystically crowned with thorn. On His departure from this world to the place whence He came, He repeated the beginning of His old descent, in order that the Word beheld at first in the bush, and afterwards taken up crowned by the thorn, might show the whole to be the work of one power, He Himself being one, the Son of the Father, who is truly one, the beginning and the end of time.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_44_oration_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"But in opposition to all these, do you reckon up for me the expressions which make for your ignorant arrogance, such as \"My God and your God,\"[fn-44-P4413_1396781:29-nf] or greater, or created, or made, or sanctified;[fn-44-P4414_1396851:30-nf] Add, if you like, Servant[fn-44-P4415_1396923:31-nf] and Obedient[fn-44-P4416_1396954:32-nf] and Gave[fn-44-P4417_1396981:33-nf] and Learnt,[fn-44-P4418_1397010:34-nf] and was commanded,[fn-44-P4419_1397045:35-nf] was sent,[fn-44-P4420_1397081:36-nf] can do nothing of Himself, either say, or judge, or give, or will.[fn-44-P4421_1397176:37-nf] And further these,-His ignorance,[fn-44-P4422_1397230:38-nf] subjection,[fn-44-P4423_1397262:39-nf] prayer,[fn-44-P4424_1397290:40-nf] asking,[fn-44-P4425_1397316:41-nf] increase,[fn-44-P4426_1397345:42-nf] being made perfect.[fn-44-P4427_1397383:43-nf] And if you like even more humble than these; such as speak of His sleeping,[fn-44-P4428_1397480:44-nf] hungering,[fn-44-P4429_1397525:45-nf] being in an agony,[fn-44-P4430_1397574:46-nf] and fearing;[fn-44-P4431_1397607:47-nf] or perhaps you would make even His Cross and Death a matter of reproach to Him.

Perfect righteousness is not, save only in the angels: and scarce in angels, if they be compared with God: yet if there be any perfect righteousness of souls and spirits which God hath created, it is in the angels, holy, just, good, by no lapse turned aside, by no pride falling, but remaining ever in the contemplation of the Word of God, and having nothing else sweet unto them save Him by whom they were created; in them is perfect righteousness: but in us it has begun to be, of faith, by the Spirit. Ye heard when the Psalm was read,\"Begin[fn-42-P4222_2299779:11-nf] to the Lord in confession.\"[fn-42-P4223_2299857:12-nf] \"Begin,\" saith it; the beginning of our righteousness is the confession of sins.

At present we are still fighting: if we fight we are in the lists;[fn-42-P4225_2300466:14-nf] we smite and are smitten; but who shall conquer, remains to be seen. And that man conquers, who even when he smites presumes not on his own strength, but relies upon God that cheers him on. The devil is alone when he fights against us. If we are with God, we overcome the devil: for if thou fight alone with the devil, thou wilt be overcome. He is a skillful enemy: how may palms has he won! Consider to what he has cast us down t That we are born mortal, comes of this, that he in the first place cast down from Paradise our very original. What then is to be done, seeing he is so well practised? Let the Almighty be invoked to thine aid against the devices of the devil. Let Him dwell in thee, who cannot be overcome, and thou shalt securely overcome him who is wont to overcome. But to overcome whom? Those in whom God dwelleth not. For, that ye may know it, brethren; Adam being in Paradise despised the commandment of God, and lifted up the neck, as if he desired to be his own master, and were loath to be subject to the will of God: so he fell from that immortality, from that blessedness. But there was a certain man, a man now well skilled, though a mortal born, who even as he sat on the dunghill, purifying with worms, overcame the devil: yea, Adam himself then overcame: even he, in Job; because Job was of his race. So then, Adam, overcome in Paradise, overcame on the dunghill. Being in Paradise, he gave ear to the persuasion of the woman which the devil had put into her: but being on the dunghill he said to Eve, \"Thou hast spoken as one of the foolish women.\"[fn-42-P4226_2302058:15-nf] There he lent an ear, here he gave an answer: when he was glad, he listened, when he was scourged, he overcame. Therefore, see what follows, my brethren, in the Epistle: because this is what it would have us lay to heart, that we may overcome the devil indeed, but not of ourselves. \"If ye know that He is righteous,\" saith it, \"know ye that every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him:\" of God, of Christ.

At all events, while the apostles were still preaching, and while eye-witnesses of (the works of) Jesus were still teaching His doctrine, there was no small discussion among the converts from Judaism regarding Gentile believers, on the point whether they ought to observe Jewish customs, or should reject the burden of clean and unclean meats, as not being obligatory on those who had abandoned their ancestral Gentile customs, and had become believers in Jesus.

Does not Paul also show that those who said, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,\" were corrupters of good manners by their evil communications, adding immediately afterwards, \"Evil communications corrupt good manners;\" and yet he intimated that these were within the Church when he says, \"How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?\"[fn-35-P3524_1990658:73-nf] But when does he fail to express his abhorrence of the covetous? Or could anything be said in stronger terms, than that covetousness should be called idolatry, as the same apostle declared?[fn-35-P3525_1990876:74-nf] Nor did Cyprian understand his language otherwise, inserting it when need required in his letters; though he confesses that in his time there were in the Church not covetous men of an ordinary type, but robbers and usurers, and these found not among the masses, but among the bishops. And yet I should be willing to understand that those of whom the apostle says, \"Their word does spread as a canker,\" were without the Church, but Cyprian himself will not allow me. For, when showing, in his letter to Antonianus,[fn-35-P3526_1991407:75-nf] that no man ought to sever himself from the unity of the Church before the time of the final separation of the just and unjust, merely because of the admixture of evil men in the Church, when he makes it manifest how holy he was, and deserving of the illustrious martyrdom which he won, he says, \"What swelling of arrogance it is, what forgetfulness of humility and gentleness, that any one should dare or believe that he can do what the Lord did not grant even to the apostles,-to think that he can distinguish the tares from the wheat, or, as if it were granted to him to carry the fan and purge the floor, to endeavor to separate the chaff from the grain! And whereas the apostle says, `But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth,'[fn-35-P3527_1992607:76-nf] that he should seem to choose those of gold and of silver, and despise and cast away and condemn those of wood and of earth, when really the vessels of wood are only to be burned in the day of the Lord by the burning of the divine conflagration, and those of earth are to be broken by Him to whom the `rod of iron[fn-35-P3528_1992941:77-nf] has been given.'\"[fn-35-P3529_1992975:78-nf] By this argument, therefore, against those who, under the pretext of avoiding the society of wicked men, had severed themselves from the unity of the Church, Cyprian shows that by the great house of which the apostle spoke, in which there were not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, he understood nothing else but the Church, in which there should be good and bad, till at the last day it should be cleansed as a threshing-floor by the winnowing-fan. And if this be so, in the Church herself, that is, in the great house itself, there were vessels to dishonor, whose word did spread like a canker. For the apostle, speaking of them, taught as follows: \"And their word,\" he says, \"will spread as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure. having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth.\"[fn-35-P3530_1994170:79-nf] If, therefore, they whose words did spread as doth a canker were as it were vessels to dishonor in the great house, and by that \"great house\" Cyprian understands the unity of the Church itself, surely it cannot be that their canker polluted the baptism of Christ. Accordingly, neither without, any more than within, can any one who is of the devil's party, either in himself or in any other person, stain the sacrament which is of Christ. It is not, therefore, the case that \"the word which spreads as a canker to the ears of those who hear it gives remission of sins;\"[fn-35-P3531_1994763:80-nf] but when baptism is given in the words of the gospel, however great be the perverseness of understanding on the part either of him through whom, or of him to whom it is given, the sacrament itself is holy in itself on account of Him whose sacrament it is. And if any one, receiving it at the hands of a misguided man, yet does not receive the perversity of the minister, but only the holiness of the mystery, being closely bound to the unity of the Church in good faith and hope and charity, he receives remission of his sins,-not by the words which do eat as doth a canker, but by the sacraments of the gospel flowing from a heavenly source. But if the recipient himself be misguided, on the one hand, what is given is of no avail for the salvation of the misguided man; and yet, on the other hand, that which is received remains holy in the recipient, and is not renewed to him if he be brought to the right way.Chap. 13.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":41,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_59_book_ii","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"ANF-01","text":"5.

To cling to God continually, and as you say inseparably to hold fast to meditation on Him, is impossible for a man while still in this weak flesh of ours. But we ought to be aware on what we should have the purpose of our mind fixed, and to what goal we should ever recall the gaze of our soul: and when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and grieve and sigh when it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it discovers itself to have fallen away from gazing on Him, it should admit that it has lapsed from the highest good, considering that even a momentary departure from gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our gaze has wandered ever so little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the soul back to Him, and recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight direction. For everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when the devil has been expelled. from this, and sins no longer reign in it, it follows that the kingdom of God as founded in us, as the Evangelist says \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-35-P3539_1321607:14-nf] But nothing else can be \"within you,\" but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the character, when he says \"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3540_1322000:15-nf] And so if the kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death. For by these tokens the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil are distinguished: and in truth if lifting up our mental gaze on high we would consider that state in which the heavenly powers live on high, who are truly in the kingdom of God, what should we imagine it to be except perpetual and lasting joy? For what is so specially peculiar and appropriate to true blessedness as constant calm and eternal joy? And that you may be quite sure that this, which we say, is really so, not on my own authority but on that of the Lord, hear how very clearly He describes the character and condition of that world: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I create new beavers and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into mind. But ye shall be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create.\"[fn-35-P3541_1323178:16-nf] And again \"joy and gladness shall be found therein: thanksgiving and the voice of praise, and there shall be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath.\"[fn-35-P3542_1323356:17-nf] And again: \"they shall obtain joy and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\"[fn-35-P3543_1323471:18-nf] And if you want to know more definitely about that life and the city of the saints, hear what the voice of the Lord proclaims to the heavenly Jerusalem herself: \"I will make,\" says He, \"thine officers peace and thine overseers righteousness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders. And salvation shall take possession of thy walls, and praise of thy gates. The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon give light to thee: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended:\"[fn-35-P3544_1324238:19-nf] and therefore the holy Apostle does not say generally or without qualification that every joy is the kingdom of God, but markedly and emphatically that joy alone which is \"in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3545_1324450:20-nf] For he was perfectly aware of another detestable joy, of which we hear \"the world shall rejoice,\"[fn-35-P3546_1324571:21-nf] and \"woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall mourn.\"[fn-35-P3547_1324644:22-nf] In fact the kingdom of heaven must be taken in a threefold sense, either that the heavens shall reign, i.e., the saints over other things subdued, according to this text, \"Be thou over five cities, and thou over ten;\"[fn-35-P3548_1324883:23-nf] and this which is said to the disciples: \"Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel:\"[fn-35-P3549_1325022:24-nf] or that the heavens themselves shall begin to be reigned over by Christ, when \"all things are subdued unto Him,\" and God begins to be \"all in all:\"[fn-35-P3550_1325193:25-nf] or else that the saints shall reign in heaven with the Lord.","title":"I.

And if any one will defend such language on account of the meaning which is conveyed under the name of Zeus, thus speaking in the dialogue of Plato, why should not he who investigates the meaning of the words of the Son of God, or those of the Creator ([fn-102-P10263_2723009:51-nf] in the prophets, express a profounder meaning than any conveyed by the words of Zeus in the Timaeus? For the characteristic of divinity is the announcement of future events, predicted not by human power, but shown by the result to be due to a divine spirit in him who made the announcement. Accordingly, we do not say to each of our hearers, \"Believe, first of all, that He whom I introduce to thee is the Son of God; \"but we put the Gospel before each one, as his character and disposition may fit him to receive it, inasmuch as we have learned to know \"how we ought to answer every man.\"[fn-102-P10264_2723622:52-nf] And there are some who are capable of receiving nothing more than an exhortation to believe, and to these we address that alone; while we approach others, again, as far as possible, in the way of demonstration, by means of question and answer.

For thus they will allege that this passage refers to the flesh strictly so called, and not to fleshly works, as I have pointed out, so representing the apostle as contradicting himself. For immediately following, in the same Epistle, he says conclusively, speaking thus in reference to the flesh: \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So, when this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O death, where is thy victory? \"[fn-90-P9069_2619910:101-nf] Now these words shall be appropriately said at the time when this mortal and corruptible flesh, which is subject to death, which also is pressed down by a certain dominion of death, rising up into life, shall put on incorruption and immortality. For then, indeed, shall death be truly vanquished, when that flesh which is held down by it shall go forth from under its dominion. And again, to the Philippians he says: \"But our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who shall transfigure the body of our humiliation conformable to the body of His glory, even as He is able (ita ut possit) according to the working of His own power.\"[fn-90-P9070_2620610:102-nf] What, then, is this \"body of humiliation\" which the Lord shall transfigure, [so as to be] conformed to \"the body of His glory? \"Plainly it is this body composed of flesh, which is indeed humbled when it falls into the earth. Now its transformation [takes place thus], that while it is mortal and corruptible, it becomes immortal and incorruptible, not after its own proper substance, but after the mighty working of the Lord, who is able to invest the mortal with immortality, and the corruptible with incorruption.

It will be profitable, therefore, that in addition to what we have said above, we should make this one remark. Our teaching on the subject of the resurrection is not, as Celsus imagines, derived from anything that we have heard on the doctrine of metempsychosis; but we know that the soul, which is immaterial and invisible in its nature, exists in no material place, without having a body suited to the nature of that place. Accordingly, it at one time puts off one body which was necessary before, but which is no longer adequate in its changed state, and it exchanges it for a second; and at another time it assumes another in addition to the former, which is needed as a better covering, suited to the purer ethereal regions of heaven. When it comes into the world at birth, it casts off the integuments which it needed in the womb; and before doing this, it puts on another body suited for its life upon earth. Then, again, as there is \"a tabernacle\" and \"an earthly house\" which is in some sort necessary for this tabernacle, Scripture teaches us that \"the earthly house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved,\" but that the tabernacle shall \"be clothed upon with a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\"[fn-110-P11008_2963846:68-nf] The men of God say also that \"the corruptible shall put on incorruption,\"[fn-110-P11009_2963938:69-nf] which is a different thing from \"the incorruptible; \"and \"the mortal shall put on immortality,\" which is different from \"the immortal.\" Indeed, what \"wisdom\" is to \"the wise,\" and \"justice\" to \"the just,\" and \"peace\" to \"the peaceable,\" the same relation does \"incorruption\" hold to \"the incorruptible,\" and \"immortality\" to \"the immortal.\" Behold, then, to what a prospect Scripture encourages us to look, when it speaks to us of being clothed with incorruption and immortality, which are, as it were, vestments which will not suffer those who are covered with them to come to corruption or death.

If for the toil's sake God was content with making the Son only, instead of making all things at once, this is an irreligious thought, especially in those who know the words of Esaias, `The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, hungereth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of His understandings[fn-32-P3248_1280000:39-nf] .'

Such an one is born in this moment; he will be a prince over cities and will govern the people, in the fulness of riches and power. Another is born the instant after; he will be poor, miserable, and will wander daily from door to door begging his bread. Consequently they divide the Zodiac into twelve parts, and, as the sun takes thirty days to traverse each of the twelve divisions of this unerring circle, they divide them into thirty more. Each of them forms sixty new ones, and these last are again divided into sixty. Let us see then if, in determining the birth of an infant, it will be possible to observe this rigorous division of time. The child is born. The nurse ascertains the sex; then she awaits the wail which is a sign of its life. Until then how many moments have passed do you think? The nurse announces the birth of the child to the Chaldaean: how many minutes would you count before she opens her mouth, especially if he who records the hour is outside the women's apartments? And we know that he who consults the dial, ought, whether by day or by night, to mark the hour with the most precise exactitude. What a swarm of seconds passes during this time! For the planet of nativity ought to be found, not only in one of the twelve divisions of the Zodiac, and even in one of its first subdivisions, but again in one of the sixtieth parts which divide this last, and even, to arrive at the exact truth, in one of the sixtieth subdivisions that this contains in its turn. And to obtain such minute knowledge, so impossible to grasp from this moment, each planet must be questioned to find its position as regards the signs of the Zodiac and the figures that the planets form at the moment of the child's birth.

As to things strangled, we are forbidden by Scripture to partake of them, because the blood is still in them; and blood, especially the odour arising from blood, is said to be the food of demons. Perhaps, then, if we were to eat of strangled animals, we might have such spirits feeding along with us. And the reason which forbids the use of strangled animals for food is also applicable to the use of blood. And it may not be amiss, as bearing on this point, to recall a beautiful saying in the writings of Sextus,[fn-113-P11367_3097699:61-nf] which is known to most Christians: \"The eating of animals,\" says he, \"is a matter of indifference; but to abstain from them is more agreeable to reason.\" It is not, therefore, simply an account of some traditions of our fathers that we refrain from eating victims offered to those called gods or heroes or demons, but for other reasons, some of which I have here mentioned. it is not to be supposed, however, that we are to abstain from the flesh of animals in the same way as we are bound to abstain from all race and wickedness: we are indeed to abstain not only from the flesh of animals, but from all other kinds of food, if we cannot partake of them without incurring evil, and the consequences of evil. For we are to avoid eating for gluttony, or for the mere gratification of the appetite, without regard to the health and sustenance of the body. We do not believe that souls pass from one body to another, and that they may descend so low as to enter the bodies of the brutes. If we abstain at times from eating the flesh of animals, it is evidently, therefore, not for the same reason as Pythagoras; for it is the reasonable soul alone that we honour, and we commit its bodily organs with due honours to the grave. For it is not right that the dwelling-place of the rational soul should be cast aside anywhere without honour, like the carcases of brute beasts; and so much the more when we believe that the respect paid to the body redounds to the honour of the person who received from God a soul which has nobly employed the organs of the body in which it resided.

For the apostle, in confuting those who denied that there was any resurrection of the dead, corrects their view by showing the absurdity which follows those who entertain this view, however loth they may be to admit the consequence, in order that, while they shrink in abhorrence from what is impious to say, they may correct what they have ventured to believe. His argument continues thus: \"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ; whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.\"[fn-57-P5780_2794555:99-nf] In order that, while they fear to say that Christ had not risen, with the other wicked and accursed conclusions which follow from such a statement, they may correct what they said in a spirit of folly and infidelity, that there is no resurrection of the dead. If, therefore, you take away what stands at the head of this argument, \"If there be no resurrection of the dead,\" the rest is spoken amiss, and yet must be ascribed to the apostle. But if you restore the supposition on which the rest depends, and place as the hypothesis from which you start, \"There is no resurrection of the dead,\" then the conclusion will follow rightly, \"Then is Christ not risen, and our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain,\" with all the rest that is appended to it. And all these statements of the apostle are wise and good, since whatever evil they have in them is to be imputed to those who denied the resurrection of the dead. In the same manner also, in my epistle, take away my supposition, If every one is born again in spiritual grace of the same character as he by whom he is baptized, and if, when the man who baptizes is genuinely and manifestly good, he does of himself give faith, he is the origin and root and head of him who is being born again; but when the baptizer is a wicked man, and undetected in his wickedness, then each man who is baptized receives his faith from Christ, derives his origin from Christ, is rooted in Christ, makes his boast in Christ as his Head:-take away, I say, this hypothesis, on which all that follows depends, and there remains a saying of the worst description which must fairly be ascribed to me, viz., that all who are baptized should desire that they should have faithless men to baptize them, and be ignorant of their faithlessness. For however good men they may have to baptize them, Christ is incomparably better who will then be the Head of the baptized, if the baptizer be a faithless man, but undetected.[fn-57-P5781_2796536:100-nf] But let the statements that you make be restored, and then it will forthwith be found that this which depends upon it and follows in close connection from it is not my sentiment, and that any evil which it contains is retorted on the opinion which you maintain. In like manner, take away the supposition, If the good baptizer is the good tree, so that he whom he has baptized is his good fruit, and if, when the character of an evil tree is concealed, then any one that has been baptized by it is born, not of it, but of Christ,-take away this hypothesis, which you were compelled to confess had its origin in your sect and in the letter of Petilianus, and the mad conclusion which follows from it will be mine, to be ascribed to me alone, then they are justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil men, than they who are baptized by men that are genuinely and manifestly good.[fn-57-P5782_2797465:101-nf] But restore the hypothesis on which this depends, and you will at once see both that I have been right in making this statement for your correction, and that all that with good reason diseases you in this opinion has recoiled upon your own head.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_56_viii_the_second_conference_of_abbot_serenus_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"For it is quite clear that they aim these attacks, with which they assault men, even against each other, for in like manner they do not cease to promote with unwearied strife the discords and struggles which they have undertaken for some peoples because of a sort of innate love of wickedness which they have: and this we read of as being very clearly set forth in the vision of Daniel the prophet, where the angel Gabriel speaks as follows: \"Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy God, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael one of the chief princes came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians. But I am come to teach thee what thinks shall befall thy people in the latter days.\"[fn-46-P4687_1703050:21-nf] And we can not possibly doubt that this prince of the kingdom of the Persians was a hostile power, which favoured the nation of the Persians an enemy of God's people; for in order to hinder the good which it saw would result from the solution of the question for which the prophet prayed the Lord, by the archangel, in its jealousy it opposed itself to prevent the saving comfort of the angel from reaching Daniel too speedily, and from strengthening the people of God, over which the archangel Gabriel was: and the latter said that even then, owing to the fierceness of his assaults, he would not have been able to come to him, had not Michael the archangel come to help him, and met the prince of the kingdom of the Persians, and joined battle with him, and intervened, and defended him from his attack, and so enabled him to come to instruct the prophet after twenty-one days. And a little later on it says: \"And the angel said: Dost thou know wherefore I am come to thee? And now I will return to fight against the prince of the Persians. For when I went forth, there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming. But I will tell thee what is written down in the Scriptures of truth: and none is my helper in all these things but Michael your prince.\"[fn-46-P4688_1704320:22-nf] And again: \"At that time shall Michael rise up, the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy people.\"[fn-46-P4689_1704454:23-nf] So then we read that in the same way another was called the prince of the Greeks, who since he was patron of that nation which was subject to him seems to have been opposed to the nation of the Persians as well as to the people of Israel. From which we clearly see that antagonistic powers raise against each other those quarrels of nations, and conflicts and dissensions, which they show among themselves at their instigation, and that they either exult at their victories or are cast down at theirdefeats, and thus cannot live in harmony among themselves, while each of them is always striving with restless jealousy on behalf of those whom he presides over, against the patron of some other nation.","title":"VIII.

But when the enemy saw himself to be too weak for Antony's determination, and that he rather was conquered by the other's firmness, overthrown by his great faith and falling through his constant prayers, then at length putting his trust in the weapons which are[fn-36-P3661_1512763:17-nf] `in the navel of his belly' and boasting in them-for they are his first snare for the young-he attacked the young man, disturbing him by night and harassing him by day, so that even the onlookers saw the struggle which was going on between them. The one would suggest foul thoughts and the other counter them with prayers: the one fire him with lush the other, as one who seemed to blush, fortify his body with faith, prayers, and fasting. And the devil, unhappy wight, one night even took upon him the shape of a woman and imitated all her acts simply to beguile Antony. But he, his mind filled with Christ and the nobility inspired by Him, and considering the spirituality of the soul, quenched the coal of the other's deceit. Again the enemy suggested the ease of pleasure. But he like a man filled with rage and grief turned his thoughts to the threatened fire and the gnawing worm, and setting these in array against his adversary, passed through the temptation unscathed. All this was a source of shame to his foe. For he, deeming himself like God, was now mocked by a young man; and he who boasted himself against flesh and blood was being put to flight by a man in the flesh. For the Lord was working with Antony-the Lord who for our sake took flesh[fn-36-P3662_1514182:18-nf] and gave the body victory over the devil, so that all who truly fight can say[fn-36-P3663_1514292:19-nf] , `not I but the grace of God which was with me.'","title":"Life of Antony","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":15,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_38_life_of_antony","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"19.

He endured death, then; but death He hanged on the cross, and mortal men are delivered from death. The Lord calls to mind a great matter, which was done in a figure with them of old: \"And as Moses,\" saith He, \"lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up; that every one who believeth on Him may not perish, but have everlasting life.\" A great mystery is here, as they who read know. Again, let them hear, as well they who have not read as they who have forgotten what perhaps they had heard or read. The people Israel were fallen helplessly in the wilderness by the bite of serpents; they suffered a great calamity by many deaths: for it was the stroke of God correcting and scourging them that He might instruct them. In this was shown a great mystery, the figure of a thing to come: the Lord Himself testifies in this passage, so that no man can give another interpretation than that which the truth indicates concerning itself. Now Moses was ordered by the Lord to make a brazen serpent, and to raise it on a pole in the wilderness, and to admonish the people Israel, that, when any had been bitten by a serpent, he should look to that serpent raised up on the pole. This was done: men were bitten; they looked and were healed.[fn-7-P767_388559:13-nf] What are the biting serpents? Sins, from the mortality of the flesh. What is the serpent lifted up? The Lord's death on the cross. For as death came by the serpent, it was figured by the image of a serpent. The serpent's bite was deadly, the Lord's death is life-giving. A serpent is gazed on that the serpent may have no power. What is this? A death is gazed on, that death may have no power. But whose death? The death of life: if it may be said, the death of life; ay, for it may be said, but said wonderfully. But should it not be spoken, seeing it was a thing to be done? Shall I hesitate to utter that which the Lord has deigned to do for me? Is not Christ the life? And yet Christ hung on the cross. Is not Christ life? And yet Christ was dead. But in Christ's death, death died. Life dead slew death; the fullness of life swallowed up death; death was absorbed in the body of Christ. So also shall we say in the resurrection, when now triumphant we shall sing, \"Where, O death, is thy contest? Where, O death, is thy sting?\"[fn-7-P768_389612:14-nf] Meanwhile brethren, that we may be healed from sin, let us now gaze on Christ crucified; for \"as Moses,\" saith He, \"lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth on Him may not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Just as they who looked on that serpent perished not by the serpent's bites, so they who look in faith on Christ's death are healed from the bites of sins. But those were healed from death to temporal life; whilst here He saith, \"that they may have everlasting life.\" Now there is this difference between the figurative image and the real thing: the figure procured temporal life; the reality, of which that was the figure, procures eternal life.","title":"Tractate XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_58_epistle_lxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"17.

For no uniform crown of perfection can be offered to all men, because all have not the same virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and different measures of perfection itself. And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For though they are called blessed, whose is the kingdom of heaven, and blessed are they who shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed are they who shall be filled, yet we believe that there is a great difference between the habitations of the kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and also between the reception of consolation and the fulness and satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. \"For there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-51-P5193_1875211:36-nf] While therefore in accordance with this rule holy Scripture praises those who fear God, and says \"Blessed are all they that fear the Lord,\"[fn-51-P5194_1875375:37-nf] and promises them for this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: \"There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment. But he that feareth is not yet perfect in love.\"[fn-51-P5195_1875611:38-nf] And again, though it is a grand thing to serve God, and it is said: \"Serve the Lord in fear;\" and: \"It is a great thing for thee to be called My servant;\" and: \"Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing,\"[fn-51-P5196_1875869:39-nf] yet it is said to the Apostles: \"I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I call you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.\"[fn-51-P5197_1876139:40-nf] And once more: \"Ye are My friends, if ye do whatever I command you.\"[fn-51-P5198_1876233:41-nf] You see then that there are different stages of perfection, and that we are called by the Lord from high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become blessed and perfect in the fear of God; going as it is written \"from strength to strength,\"[fn-51-P5199_1876511:42-nf] and from one perfection to another, i.e., mounting with keenness of soul from fear to hope, is summoned in the end to that still more blessed stage, which, is love, and he who has been \"a faithful and wise servant\"[fn-52-P5200_1876757:43-nf] will pass to the companionship of friendship and to the adoption of sons. So then our saying also must be understood according to this meaning: not that we say that the consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense which is promised to the saints is of no value, but because, though they are useful and introduce those who pursue them to the first beginning of blessedness, yet again love, wherein is already fuller confidence, and a lasting joy, will remove them from servile fear and mercenary hope to the love of God, and carry them on to the adoption of sons, and somehow make them from being perfect still more perfect. For the Saviour says that in His Father's house are \"many mansions,\"[fn-52-P5201_1877501:44-nf] and although all the stars seem to be in the sky, yet there is a mighty difference between the brightness of the sun and of the moon, and between that of the morning star and the rest of the stars. And therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it not only above fear and hope but also above all gifts which are counted great and wonderful, and shows the way of love still more excellent than all. For when after finishing his list of spiritual gifts of virtues he wanted to describe its members, he began as follows: \"And yet I show unto you a still more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and though I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.\" You see then that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect, nothing more sublime, and, if I may say so, nothing more enduring can be found than love. For \"whether there be prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall be destroyed,\" but \"love never faileth,\"[fn-52-P5202_1878734:45-nf] and without it not only those most excellent kinds of gifts, but even the glory of martyrdom itself will fail.","title":"XI.

For silence is a matter of great consequence when one's speech is mean.[fn-13-P1305_354128:3-nf] And to refrain from utterance is indeed an admirable thing, where there is lack of training; and verily he is the highest philosopher who knows how to cover his ignorance by abstinence from public address. Knowing, therefore, the feebleness of tongue proper to me, I should have preferred such a course. Nevertheless the spectacle of the onlookers impels me to speak. Since, then, this solemnity is a glorious one among our festivals, and the spectators form a crowded gathering, and our assembly is one of elevated fervour in the faith, I shall face the task of commencing an address with confidence.[fn-13-P1306_354802:4-nf] And this I may attempt all the more boldly, since the Father[fn-13-P1307_354907:5-nf] requests me, and the Church is with me, and the sainted martyrs with this object strengthen what is weak in me. For these have inspired aged men to accomplish with much love a long course, and constrained them to support their failing steps by the staff of the word;[fn-13-P1308_355425:6-nf] and they have stimulated women to finish their course like the young men, and have brought to this, too, those of tender years, yea, even creeping children. In this wise have the martyrs shown their power, leaping with joy in the presence of death, laughing at the sword, making sport of the wrath of princes, grasping at death as the producer of deathlessness, making victory their own by their fall, through the body taking their leap to heaven, suffering their members to be scattered abroad in order that they might hold[fn-13-P1309_355967:7-nf] their souls, and, bursting the bars of life, that they might open the. gates[fn-13-P1310_356058:8-nf] of heaven. And if any one believes not that death is abolished, that Hades is trodden under foot, that the chains thereof are broken, that the tyrant is bound, let him look on the martyrs disporting themselves[fn-13-P1311_356281:9-nf] in the presence of death, and taking up the jubilant strain of the victory of Christ. O the marvel! Since the hour when Christ despoiled Hades, men have danced in triumph over death. \"O death, where is thy sting! O grave, where is thy victory? \"[fn-13-P1312_356545:10-nf] Hades and the devil have been despoiled, and stripped of their ancient armour, and cast out of their peculiar power. And even as Goliath had his head cut off with his own sword, so also is the devil, who has been the father of death, put to rout through death; and he finds that the selfsame thing which he was wont to use as the ready weapon of his deceit, has become the mighty instrument of his own destruction. Yea, if we may so speak, casting his hook at the Godhead, and seizing the wonted enjoyment of the baited pleasure, he is himself manifestly caught while he deems himself the captor, and discovers that in place of the man he has touched the God. By reason thereof do the martyrs leap upon the head of the dragon, and despise every species of torment. For since the second Adam has brought up the first Adam out of the deeps of Hades, as Jonah was delivered out of the whale, and has set forth him who was deceived as a citizen of heaven to the shame of the deceiver, the gates of Hades have been shut, and the gates of heaven have been opened, so as to offer an unimpeded entrance to those who rise thither in faith. In olden time Jacob beheld a ladder erected reaching to heaven, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it. But now, having been made man for man's sake, He who is the Friend of man has crushed with the foot of His divinity him who is the enemy of man, and has borne up the man with the hand of His Christhood,[fn-13-P1313_358019:11-nf] and has made the trackless ether to be trodden by the feet of man. Then the angels were ascending and descending; but now the Angel of the great counsel neither ascendeth nor descendeth: for whence or where shall He change His position, who is present everywhere, and filleth all things, and holds in His hand the ends. of the world? Once, indeed, He descended, and once He ascended,-not, however, through any change[fn-13-P1314_358551:12-nf] of nature, but only in the condescension[fn-13-P1315_358609:13-nf] of His philanthropic Christhood;[fn-13-P1316_358662:14-nf] and He is seated as the Word with the Father, and as the Word He dwells in the womb, and as the Word He is found everywhere, and is never separated from the God of the universe. Aforetime did the devil deride the nature of man with great laughter, and he has had his joy over the times of our calamity as his festal-days. But the laughter is only a three days' pleasure, while the wailing is eternal; and his great laughter has prepared for him a greater wailing and ceaseless tears, and inconsolable weeping, and a sword in his heart. This sword did our Leader forge against the enemy with fire in the virgin furnace, in such wise and after such fashion as He willed, and gave it its point by the energy of His invincible divinity, and dipped it in the water of an undefiled baptism, and sharpened it by sufferings without passion in them, and made it bright by the mystical resurrection; and herewith by Himself He put to death the vengeful adversary, together with his whole host. What manner of word, therefore, will express our joy or his misery? For he who was once an archangel is now a devil; he who once lived in heaven is now seen crawling like a serpent upon earth; he who once was jubilant with the cherubim, is now shut up in pain in the guard-house of swine; and him, too, in fine, shall we put to rout if we mind those things which are contrary to his choice, by the grace and kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the power unto the ages of the ages. Amen.","title":"On All the Saints.","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_63_xiii_the_third_conference_of_abbot_chaeremon_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And so the grace of God always co-operates with our will for its advantage, and in all things assists, protects, and defends it, in such a way as sometimes even to require and look for some efforts of good will from it that it may not appear to confer its gifts on one who is asleep or relaxed in sluggish ease, as it seeks opportunities to show that as the torpor of man's sluggishness is shaken off its bounty is not unreasonable, when it bestows it on account of some desire and efforts to gain it. And none the less does God's grace continue to be free grace while in return for some small and trivial efforts it bestows with priceless bounty such glory of immortality, and such gifts of eternal bliss. For because the faith of the thief on the cross came as the first thing, no one would say that therefore the blessed abode of Paradise was not promised to him as a free gift, nor could we hold that it was the penitence of King David's single word which he uttered: \"I have sinned against the Lord,\" and not rather the mercy of God which removed those two grievous sins of his, so that it was vouchsafed to him to hear from the prophet Nathan: \"The Lord also hath put away thine iniquity: thou shalt not die.\"[fn-53-P5379_1924306:86-nf] The fact then that he added murder to adultery, was certainly due to free will: but that he was reproved by the prophet, this was the grace of Divine Compassion. Again it was his own doing that he was humbled and acknowledged his guilt; but that in a very short interval of time he was granted pardon for such sins, this was the gift of the merciful Lord. And what shall we say of this brief confession and of the incomparable infinity of Divine reward, when it is easy to see what the blessed Apostle, as he fixes his gaze on the greatness of future remuneration, announced on those countless persecutions of his? \"for,\" says he, \"our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,\"[fn-53-P5380_1925071:87-nf] of which elsewhere he constantly affirms, saying that \"the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the future glory which shall be revealed in us.\"[fn-53-P5381_1925266:88-nf] However much then human weakness may strive, it cannot come up to the future reward, nor by its efforts so take off from Divine grace that it should not always remain a free gift. And therefore the aforesaid teacher of the Gentiles, though he bears his witness that he had obtained the grade of the Apostolate by the grace of God, saying: \"By the grace of God I am what I am,\" yet also declares that he himself had corresponded to Divine Grace, where he says: \"And His Grace in me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: and yet not I, but the Grace of God with me.\"[fn-53-P5382_1925876:89-nf] For when he says: \"I laboured,\" he shows the effort of his own will; when he says: \"yet not I, but the grace of God,\" he points out the value of Divine protection; when he says: \"with me,\" he affirms that it cooperates with him when he was not idle or careless, but working and making an effort.","title":"XIII.

Therefore, my Brethren, since we too are born of him, and as the Apostle says, \"In Adam all die;\"[fn-46-P4690_2010894:14-nf] for we were all at first two persons if we were loth to obey the physician, that we might not be sick; let us obey Him now, that we may be delivered from sickness. The physician gave us precepts, when we were whole; He gave us precepts that we might not need a physician. \"They that are whole,\" He saith, \"need not a physician, but they that are sick.\"[fn-46-P4691_2011267:15-nf] When whole we despised these precepts, and by experience have felt how to our own destruction we despised His precepts. Now we are sick, we are in distress, we are on the bed of weakness; yet let us not despair. For because we could not come to the Physician, He hath vouchsafed to come Himself to us. Though despised by man when he was whole, He did not despise him when he was stricken. He did not leave off to give other precepts to the weak, who would not keep the first precepts, that he might not be weak; as though He would say, \"Assuredly thou hast by experience felt that I spake the truth when I said, Touch not this. Be healed then now at length, and recover the life thou hast lost. Lo, I am bearing thine infirmity; drink thou the bitter cup. For thou hast of thine own self made those my so sweet precepts which were given to thee when whole, so toilsome. They were despised and so thy distress began; cured thou canst not be, except thou drink the bitter cup, the cup of temptations, wherein this life abounds, the cup of tribulation, anguish, and sufferings. Drink then,\" He says, \"drink, that thou mayest live.\" And that the sick man may not make answer, \"I cannot, I cannot bear it, I will not drink;\" the Physician, all whole though he be, drinketh first, that the sick man may not hesitate to drink. For what bitterness is there in this cup, which He hath not drunk? If it be contumely; He heard it first when He drove out the devils, \"He hath a devil, and by Beelzebub He casteth out devils.\"[fn-46-P4692_2012800:16-nf] Whereupon in order to comfort the sick, He saith, \"If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of His household?\"[fn-46-P4693_2012979:17-nf] If pains are this bitter cup, He was bound and scourged and crucified. If death be this bitter cup, He died also. If infirmity shrink with horror from any particular kind of death, none was at that time more ignominious than the death of the cross. For it was not in vain that the Apostle, when setting forth His obedience, added, \"Made obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\"[fn-46-P4694_2013385:18-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXXVIII.

Thus, as we said above, practical knowledge is distributed among many subjects and interests, but theoretical is divided into two parts, i.e., the historical interpretation and the spiritual sense. Whence also Solomon when he had summed up the manifold grace of the Church, added: \"for all who are with her are clothed with double garments.\"[fn-54-P5478_1960098:8-nf] But of spiritual knowledge there are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical,[fn-54-P5479_1960213:9-nf] of which we read as follows in Proverbs: \"But do you describe these things to yourself in three ways according to the largeness of your heart.\"[fn-54-P5480_1961149:10-nf] And so the history embraces the knowledge of things past and visible, as it is repeated in this way by the Apostle: \"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he who was of the free was by promise.\" But to the allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to have prefigured the form of some mystery \"For these,\" says he, \"are the two covenants the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth into bondage, which is Agar. For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is compared to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.\" But the anagogical sense rises from spiritual mysteries even to still more sublime and sacred secrets of heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in these words: \"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate more than of her that hath an husband.\"[fn-54-P5481_1962255:11-nf] The tropological sense is the moral explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: \"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.\"[fn-54-P5482_1962637:12-nf] And so these four previously mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses: historically as the city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of Christ, anagogically as the heavenly city of God \"which is the mother of us all,\" tropologically, as the soul of man, which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title. Of these four kinds of interpretation the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by doctrine?\"[fn-54-P5483_1963322:13-nf] For \"revelation\" belongs to allegory whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is revealed in its spiritual sense and interpretation, as for instance if we tried to expound how \"all our fathers were under the cloud and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea,\" and how they \"all ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ.\"[fn-54-P5484_1963776:14-nf] And this explanation where there is a comparison of the figure of the body and blood of Christ which we receive daily, contains the allegorical sense. But the knowledge, which is in the same way mentioned by the Apostle, is tropological, as by it we can by a careful study see of all things that have to do with practical discernment whether they are useful and good, as in this case, when we are told to judge of our own selves \"whether it is fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered.\"[fn-54-P5485_1964301:15-nf] And this system, as has been said, contains the moral meaning. So \"prophecy\" which the Apostle puts in the third place, alludes to the anagogical sense by which the words are applied to things future and invisible, as here: \"But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those that sleep: that ye be not sorry as others also who have no hope. For if we believe that Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say to you by the word of God, that we which are alive at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent those that sleep in Christ, for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.\"[fn-54-P5486_1965091:16-nf] In which kind of exhortation the figure of anagoge is brought forward. But \"doctrine\" unfolds the simple course of historical exposition, under which is contained no more secret sense, but what is declared by the very words: as in this passage: \"For I delivered unto you first of all what I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again on the third day, and that he was seen of Cephas;\"[fn-54-P5487_1965583:17-nf] and: \"God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;\"[fn-54-P5488_1965706:18-nf] or this: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord the God is one Lord.\"[fn-54-P5489_1965783:19-nf] ","title":"XIV.

It is as if all were confusion; I see no distinguishing. Certainly Thou hast received authority to judge, because Thou art the Son of man: behold, Thou wilt be present in the judgment;the bodies will rise again; but tell us something of the judgment itself, that is, of theseparation of the evil and the good. Hear this further, then: \"They that have done good into the resurrection of life; they that havedone evil into the resurrection of judgment.\" When above He spoke of a resurrection of minds and souls, did He make any distinction? No, for all \"that hear shall live;\" because by hearing, viz. by obeying, shall they live. But certainly not all will go to eternal life by rising and coming forth from the graves,-only they that have done well; and they that have done ill, to judgment. For here He has put judgment for punishment. There will also be a separation, not such as there is now. For now we are separated, not by place, but by character, affections, desires, faith, hope, charity. Now we live together with the unjust, though the life of all is not the same: in secret we are distinguished, in secret we are separated; as grain on the floor, not as grain in the granary. On the floor, grain is both separated and mixed: separated, because severed from the chaff; mixed, because not yet winnowed. Then there will be an open separation; a distinguishing of life just as of the character, a separation as there is in wisdom, so also will there be in bodies. They that have done well will go to live with the angels of God; they that have done evil, to be tormented with the devil and his angels. And the form of a servant will pass away. For to this end He had manifested Himself, that He might execute judgment. After the judgment, He shall go hence, will lead with Him the body of which He is the head, and deliver up the kingdom of God.[fn-10-P1027_615502:15-nf] Then will openly be seen that form of God which could not be seen by the wicked, to whose vision the form of a servant must be shown. He says also in another place on this wise: \"These shall go away into everlasting burning\" (speaking of certain on the left), \"but the just into life eternal;\"[fn-10-P1028_615817:16-nf] of which life He says in another place: \"And this is eternal life, that they may know Thee the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-10-P1029_615985:17-nf] Then will He be there manifested, \"who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-10-P1030_616116:18-nf] Then He will manifest Himself, as He has promised to manifest Himself to them that love Him. For \"he that loveth me,\" saith He, \"keepeth my commandments; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"[fn-10-P1031_616394:19-nf] He was present in person with those to whom He was speaking: but they saw the form of a servant, they did not see the form of God. They were being led on His own beast to His dwelling to be healed; but now being healed, they will see, because, saith He, \"I will manifest myself to him.\" How is He shown equal to the Father?

Call to mind the ordering of the creation. God spake, the waters brought forth swimming creatures, great whales, fish, birds, and such like things. Did all the birds come of one bird? Did all vultures come of one vulture? Did all doves come of one dove? Did all snakes come of one snake? or all gilt-heads of one gilt-head?[fn-48-P4865_2087026:32-nf] or all sheep of one sheep?

Or, again, if there is but one and the same substance[fn-14-P1416_396934:43-nf] in all things, and if there is the same incorruptible nature[fn-14-P1417_397010:44-nf] in all,-the only elements of difference being, as they aver, size and figure,-how comes it that there are some bodies divine and perfect,[fn-14-P1418_397163:45-nf] and eternal,[fn-14-P1419_397192:46-nf] as they would phrase it, or lasting,[fn-14-P1420_397244:47-nf] as some one may prefer to express it; and among these some that are visible and others that are invisible,-the visible including such as sun, and moon, and stars, and earth, and water; and the invisible including gods, and demons, and spirits? For the existence of such they cannot possibly deny however desirous to do so. And again, there are other objects that are long-lived, both animals and plants. As to animals, there are, for example, among birds, as they say, the eagle, the raven, and the phoenix; and among creatures living on land, there are the stag, and the elephant, and the dragon; and among aquatic creatures there are the whales, and such like monsters of the deep. And as to trees, there are the palm, and the oak, and the persea;[fn-14-P1421_398011:48-nf] and among trees, too, there are some that are evergreens, of which kind fourteen have been reckoned up by some one; and there are others that only bloom for a certain season, and then shed their leaves. And there are other objects, again-which indeed constitute the vast mass of all which either grow or are begotten-that have an early death and a brief life. And among these is man himself, as a certain holy scripture says of him: \"Man that is born of woman is of few days.\"[fn-14-P1422_398576:49-nf] Well, but I suppose they will reply that the varying conjunctions of the atoms account fully for differences[fn-14-P1423_398702:50-nf] so great in the matter of duration. For it is maintained that there are some things that are compressed together by them, and firmly interlaced, so that they become closely compacted bodies, and consequently exceedingly hard to break up; while there are others in which more or less the conjunction of the atoms is of a looser and weaker nature, so that either quickly or after some time they separate themselves from their orderly constitution. And, again, there are some bodies made up of atoms of a definite kind and a certain common figure, while there are others made up of diverse atoms diversely disposed. But who, then, is the sagacious discriminator,[fn-14-P1424_399430:51-nf] that brings certain atoms into collocation, and separates others; and marshals some in such wise as to form the sun, and others in such a way as to originate the moon, and adapts all in natural fitness, and in accordance with the proper constitution of each star? For surely neither would those solar atoms, with their peculiar size and kind, and with their special mode of collocation, ever have reduced themselves so as to effect the production of a moon; nor, on the other hand, would the conjunctions of these lunar atoms ever have developed into a sun. And as certainly neither would Arcturus, resplendent as he is, ever boast his having the atoms possessed by Lucifer, nor would the Pleiades glory in being constituted of those of Orion. For well has Paul expressed the distinction when he says: \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-14-P1425_400397:52-nf] And if the coalition effected among them has been an unintelligent one, as is the case with soulless[fn-14-P1426_400518:53-nf] objects, then they must needs have had some sagacious artificer; and if their union has been one without the determination of will, and only of necessity, as is the case with irrational objects, then some skilful leader[fn-14-P1427_400754:54-nf] must have brought them together and taken them under his charge. And if they have linked themselves together spontaneously, for a spontaneous work, then some admirable architect must have apportioned their work for them, and assumed the superintendence among them; or there must have been one to do with them as the general does who loves order and discipline, and who does not leave his army in an irregular condition, or suffer all things to go on confusedly, but marshals the cavalry in their proper succession, and disposes the heavy-armed infantry in their due array, and the javelin-men by themselves, and the archers separately, and the slingers in like manner, and sets each force in its appropriate position, in order that all those equipped in the same way may engage together. But if these teachers think that this illustration is but a joke, because I institute a comparison between very large bodies and very small, we may pass to the very smallest.","title":"Part I.-Containing Various Sections of the Works.","author":"Dionysius"},{"chapter":15,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_28_tractate_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. For, indeed, all men are lamps, since they can be both lighted and extinguished. Moreover, when the lamps are wise, they shine and glow with the Spirit; yet also, if they did burn and are put out, they even stink. The servants of God remain good lamps by the oil of His mercy, not by their own strength. The free grace of God, truly, is the oil of the lamps. \"For I have labored more than they all,\" saith a certain lamp; and lest he should seem to burn by his own strength, he added, \"But not I, but the grace of God that was with me.\"[fn-11-P1166_715078:4-nf] All prophecy, therefore, before the coming of the Lord, is a lamp.

If they were not lamps, the Lord would not say to them, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" For after He said, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" He shows that they should not think themselves such a light as that of which it is said, \"That was the true light, that enlighteneth every man coming into this world.\" But this was said of the Lord at that time when He was distinguished from John (the Baptist). Of John the Baptist, indeed, it had been said, \"He was not the light, but that he might bear witness of the light.\"[fn-11-P1168_716405:6-nf] And lest thou shouldst say, How was he not the light, of whom Christ says that \"he was a lamp\"?-I answer, In comparison of the other light, he was not light. For \"that was the true light that enlighteneth every man coming into this world.\" Accordingly, when He said also to the disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" lest they should imagine that anything was attributedto them which was to be understood of Christ alone, and thus the lamps should be extinguished by the wind of pride, when He had said, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" He immediately subjoined, \"A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid; neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but an a candlestick, that it may shine on all that are in the house.\" But what if He did not call the apostles the candle, but the lighters of the candle, which they were to put on a candlestick? Hear that He called themselves the candle. \"So let your light shine,\" saith He, \"before men, that they, seeing your good works, may glorify,\" not you, but \"your Father who is in heaven.\"[fn-11-P1169_717473:7-nf] ","title":"Tractate XXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":52,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_60_sermon_xliii_xciii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"9. \"But when that cry was made at midnight.\"What cry was this, but that of which the Apostle says, \"In the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump\"? \"For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed\"?[fn-49-P4995_2133031:22-nf] And so when the cry was made at midnight, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh;\" what follows? \"Then all those virgins arose.\" What is, \"they\" all arose? \"The hour will come,\" said the Lord Himself, \"when all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth.\"[fn-49-P4996_2133322:23-nf] Therefore at the last trumpet they all arose. \"Now those wise virgins had brought oil with them in their vessels; but the foolish brought no oil with them.\"[fn-49-P4997_2133500:24-nf] What is the meaning of \"brought no oil with them in their vessels\"?

For circumcision was commanded to be applied on the eighth day: and what is circumcision but the spoiling of the flesh? This circumcision, then, signified the removal of carnal lusts from the heart. Therefore not without cause was it given, and ordered to be made in that member; since by that member the creature of mortal kind is procreated.

Therefore Christ's resurrection, which happened on the third day indeed of His passion, but on the eighth day in the days of the week, that same resurrection it is that doth circumcise us.

And finally, for that \"Moses gave you the law, and ye circumcise a man on the Sabbath-day,\" understand that by this is signified the good work which I have done, in that I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath-day; because he was cured that he might be whole in body, and also he believed that he might be whole in soul.","title":"Tractate XXX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"108","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"(8.) Certainly what the Apostle proceeds to say shews the excellence of the Son over things originate; `Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard. lest at any time we should let them slip.

But if the Son were in the number of things originate, He was not better than they, nor did disobedience involve increase of punishment because of Him; any more than in the Ministry of Angels there was not, according to each Angel, greater or less guilt in the transgressors, but the Law was one, and one was its vengeance on transgressors. But, whereas the Word is not in the number of originate things, but is Son of the Father, therefore, as He Himself is better and His acts better and transcendent, so also the punishment is worse.

And this again the Apostle himself describes afterwards more clearly, saying, `By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament;' and again, `But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also He is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.' And, `For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.' And again he says, `It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these[fn-57-P5729_2272550:367-nf] .' Both in the verse before us, then, and throughout, does he ascribe the word `better' to the Lord, who is better and other than originated things.

Therefore he added, \"Yet it is not I, but the grace of God which is with me.\" For that he was employed in this husbandry he clearly enough shows, where he says, \"I have planted, Apollos watered.\"[fn-52-P5247_2232685:3-nf] But this Apostle, from Saul, becoming Paul, that is, from being proud, the least of all (for the name of Saul is derived from Saul; but Paul is little; whence in a way interpreting his own name, he says, \"I am the least of the Apostles\"[fn-52-P5248_2232940:4-nf] : this Paul I say, the little, and the least, sent unto the Gentiles, says that he was sent particularly to the Gentiles. He himself so writes, we read, believe, preach it. He then in his Epistle to the Galatians says, that having been now called by the Lord Jesus, he came to Jerusalem, and \"communicated the Gospel\"[fn-52-P5249_2233275:5-nf] unto the Apostles, that their right hands were given to him, the sign of harmony, the sign of agreement, that what they had learnt from him differed in no respect from them. Afterwards he says that it was agreed between him and them, that he should go to the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision, he as a sower, they as reapers. So also with good reason, though they knew it not, did the Athenians give him his name.

To give a witness then, and for our sakes to undergo death, to raise man up and destroy the works of the devil[fn-62-P6234_2486989:357-nf] , the Saviour came, and this is the reason of His incarnate presence. For otherwise a resurrection had not been, unless there had been death; and how had death been, unless He had had a mortal body? This the Apostle, learning from Him, thus sets forth, `Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage[fn-62-P6235_2488699:358-nf] .' And, `Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-62-P6236_2488812:359-nf] .' And again, `For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the ordinance of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit[fn-62-P6237_2489124:360-nf] .' And John says, `For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved[fn-62-P6238_2489286:361-nf] .' And again, the Saviour has spoken in His own person, `For judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not might see, and that they which see might become blind[fn-62-P6239_2489480:362-nf] .' Not for Himself then, but for our salvation, and to abolish death, and to condemn sin, and to give sight to the blind, and to raise up all from the dead, has He come; but if not for Himself, but for us, by consequence not for Himself but for us is He created. But if not for Himself is He created, but for us, then He is not Himself a creature, but, as having put on our flesh, He uses such language. And that this is the sense of the Scriptures, we may learn from the Apostle, who says in Ephesians, `Having broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, to create in Himself of twain one new man, so making peace[fn-62-P6240_2490219:363-nf] .' But if in Him the twain are created, and these are in His body, reasonably then, bearing the twain in Himself, He is as if Himself created; for those who were created in Himself He made one, and He was in them, as they. And thus, the two being created in Him, He may say suitably, `The Lord created me.' For as by receiving our infirmities, He is said to be infirm Himself, though not Himself infirm, for He is the Power of God, and He became sin for us and a curse, though not having sinned Himself, but because He Himself bare our sins and our curse, so[fn-62-P6241_2490811:364-nf] , by creating us in Him, let Him say, `He created me for the works,' though not Himself a creature.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":15,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"64. And I think that the irreligious men themselves will be shamed from such a thought; for if the case stands not as we have said, but they will rule it that He is `First-born of the whole creation' as in essence-a creature among creatures, let them reflect that they will be conceiving Him as brother and fellow of the things without reason and life. For of the whole creation these also are parts; and the `First-born' must be first indeed in point of time but only thus, and in kind and similitude[fn-63-P6323_2520031:434-nf] must be the same with all. How then can they say this without exceeding all measures of irreligion? or who will endure them, if this is their language? or who can but hate them even imagining such things? For it is evident to all, that neither for Himself, as being a creature, nor as having any connection according to essence with the whole creation, has He been called `First-born' of it: but because the Word, when at the beginning He framed the creatures, condescended to things originate, that it might be possible for them to come to be. For they could not have endured His nature, which was untempered splendour, even that of the Father, unless condescending by the Father's love for man He had supported them and taken hold of them and brought them into existence[fn-63-P6324_2520816:435-nf] ; and next, because, by this condescension of the Word, the creation too is made a son[fn-63-P6325_2521373:436-nf] through Him, that He might be in all respects `First-born' of it, as has been said, both in creating, and also in being brought for the sake of all into this very world.

And this is announced to us not by the catalogue of the tribes, nor by the mixing of the registered generations, but by the patriarchs and prophets. Let us not therefore descend to such religious trifling as to establish the kingship and priesthood of Christ by the interchanges of the names. For the priestly tribe of Levi, too, was allied with the kingly tribe of Juda, through the circumstance that Aaron married Elizabeth the l sister of Naasson,[fn-21-P2136_606760:3-nf] and that Eleazar again married the daughter of Phatiel,[fn-21-P2137_606831:4-nf] and begat children. The evangelists, therefore, would thus have spoken falsely, affirming what was not truth, but a fictitious commendation. And for this reason the one traced the pedigree of Jacob the father of Joseph from David through Solomon; the other traced that of Heli also, though in a different way, the father of Joseph, from Nathan the son of David. And they ought not indeed to have been ignorant that both orders of the ancestors enumerated are the generation of David, the royal tribe of Juda.[fn-21-P2138_607355:5-nf] For if Nathan was a prophet, so also was Solomon, and so too the father of both of them; and there were prophets belonging to many of the tribes, but priests belonging to none of the tribes, save the Levites only. To no purpose, then, is this fabrication of theirs. Nor shall an assertion of this kind prevail in the Church of Christ against the exact truth, so as that a lie should be contrived for the praise and glory of Christ. For who does not know that most holy word of the apostle also, who, when he was preaching and proclaiming the resurrection of our Saviour, and confidently affirming the truth, said with great fear, \"If any say that Christ is not risen, and we assert and have believed this, and both hope for and preach that very thing, we are false witnesses of God, in alleging that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up? \"[fn-21-P2139_608220:6-nf] And if he who glorifies God the Father is thus afraid lest he should seem a false witness in narrating a marvellous fact, how should not he be justly afraid, who tries to establish the truth by a false statement, preparing an untrue opinion? For if the generations are different, and trace down no genuine seed to Joseph, and if all has been stated only with the view of establishing the position of Him who was to be born-to confirm the truth, namely, that He who was to be would be king and priest, there being at the same tune no proof given, but the dignity of the words being brought down to a feeble hymn,-it is evident that no praise accrues to God from that, since it is a falsehood, but rather judgment returns on him who asserts it, because he vaunts an unreality as though it were reality.

Now this came to pass in the time of the Passion, in which our Lord died for us, for `our Passover, Christ, is sacrificed[fn-93-P9399_3405005:89-nf] .' Therefore, because He was sacrificed, let each of us feed upon Him, and with alacrity and diligence partake of His sustenance; since He is given to all without grudging, and is in every one `a well of water flowing to everlasting life[fn-94-P9400_3405258:90-nf] .'","title":"Letter XI.

The Lord Jesus declares that He is giving His disciples a new commandment, that they should love one another. \"A new commandment,\" He says, \"I give unto you, that ye love one another.\" But was not this already commanded in the ancient law of God, where it is written, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\"?[fn-25-P2597_1528576:1-nf] Why, then, is it called a new one by the Lord, when it is proved to be so old? Is it on this account a new commandment, because He hath divested us of the old, and clothed us with the new man? For it is not indeed every kind of love that renews him that listens to it, or rather yields it obedience, but that love regarding which the Lord, in order to distinguish it from all carnal affection, added, \"as I have loved you.\" For husbands and wives love one another, and parents and children, and all other human relationships that bind men together: to say nothing of the blame-worthy and damnable love which is mutually felt by adulterers and adulteresses, by fornicators and prostitutes, and all others who are knit together by no human relationship, but by the mischievous depravity of human life. Christ, therefore, hath given us a new commandment, that we should love one another, as He also hath loved us. This is the love that renews us, making us new men, heirs of the New Testament, singers of the new song. It was this love, brethren beloved, that renewed also those of olden time, who were then the righteous, the patriarchs and prophets, as it did afterwards the blessed apostles: it is it, too, that is now renewing the nations, and from among the universal race of man, which overspreads the whole world, is making and gathering together a new people, the body of the newly-married spouse of the only-begotten Son of God, of whom it is said in the Song of Songs, \"Who is she that ascendeth, made white?\"[fn-25-P2598_1530111:2-nf] Made white indeed, because renewed; and how, but by the new commandment? Because of this, the members thereof have a mutual interest in one another; and if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; and one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.[fn-25-P2599_1530857:3-nf] For this they hear and observe, \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another:\" not as those love one another who are corrupters, nor as men love one another in a human way; but they love one another as those who are God's, and all of them sons of the Highest, and brethren, therefore, of His only Son, with that mutual love wherewith He loved them, when about to lead them on to the goal were all sufficiency should be theirs, and where their every desire should be satisfied with good things.[fn-26-P2600_1531390:4-nf] For then there will be nothing wanting they can desire, when God will be all in all.[fn-26-P2601_1531491:5-nf] An end like that has no end. No one dieth there, where no one arriveth save he that dieth to this world, not that universal kind of death whereby the body is bereft of the soul; but the death of the elect, through which, even while still remaining in this mortal flesh, the heart is set on the things which are above. Of such a death it is that the apostle said, \"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\"[fn-26-P2602_1531932:6-nf] And perhaps to this, also, do the words refer,\"Love is strong as death.\"[fn-26-P2603_1532021:7-nf] For by this love it is brought about, that, While still held in the present corruptible body, we die to this world, and our life is hid with Christ in God; yea, that love itself is our death to the world, and our life with God. For if that is death when the soul quits the body, how can it be other than death when our love quits the world? Such love, therefore, is strong as death. And what is stronger than that which bindeth the world?","title":"Tractate LXV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_71_tractate_lxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. Or was it that the Apostle Peter, as some with a perverse kind of favor strive to excuse him,[fn-26-P2616_1539807:1-nf] did not deny Christ, because, when questioned by the maid, he replied that he did not know the man, as the other evangelists more expressly affirm? As if, indeed, he that denies the man Christ does not deny Christ; and so denies Him in respect of what He became on our account, that the nature He had given us might not be lost. Whoever, therefore, acknowledges Christ as God, and disowns Him as man, Christ died not for him; for as man it was that Christ died. He who disowns Christ as man, finds no reconciliation to God by the Mediator. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.[fn-26-P2617_1540459:2-nf] He that denies Christ as man is not justified: for as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one man shall many be made righteous.[fn-26-P2618_1540652:3-nf] He that denies Christ as man, shall not rise again into the resurrection of life; for by man is death, and by man is also the resurrection of the dead: for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.[fn-26-P2619_1540886:4-nf] And by what means is He the Head of the Church, but by His manhood, because the Word was made flesh, that is, God, the Only-begotten of God the Father, became man. And how then canone be in the body of Christ who denies the man Christ? Or how can one be a member who disowns the Head? But why linger over a multitude of reasons when the Lord Himself undoes all the windings of human argumentation? For He says not, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied the man; or, as He was wont to speak in His more familiar condescension with men, The cock shall not crow till thou hast thrice denied the Son of man; but He says, \"till thou hast denied me thrice.\" What is that \"me,\" but just what He was, and what was He but Christ? Whatever of Him, therefore, he denied, he denied Himself, he denied the Christ, he denied the Lord his God. For Thomas also, his fellow-disciple, when he exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God,\" did not handle the Word, but only His flesh; and laid not his inquisitive hands on the incorporeal nature of God, but on His human body.[fn-26-P2620_1541961:5-nf] And so he touched the man, and yet recognized his God. If, then, what the latter touched, Peter denied; what the latter invoked, Peter offended. \"The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.\" Although thou say, \"I know not the man;\" although thou say, \"Man, I know not what thou sayest;\" although thou say, \"I am not one of His disciples;\"[fn-26-P2621_1542334:6-nf] thou wilt be denying me. If, which it were sinful to doubt, Christ so spake, and foretold the truth, then doubtless Peter denied Christ. Let us not accuse Christ in defending Peter. Let infirmity acknowledge its sin; for there is no falsehood in the Truth. When Peter's infirmity acknowledged its sin, his acknowledgment was full; and the greatness of the evil he had committed in denying Christ, he showed by his tears. He himself reproves his defenders, and for their conviction, brings his tears forward as witnesses. Nor have we, on our part, in so speaking, any delight in accusing the first of the apostles; but in looking on him, we ought to take home the lesson to ourselves, that no man should place his confidence in human strength. For what else had our Teacher and Saviour in view, but to show us, by making the first of the apostles himself an example, that no one ought in any way to presume of himself? And that, therefore, really took place in Peter's soul, for which he gave cause in his body. And yet he did not go before in the Lord's behalf, as he rashly presumed, but did so otherwise than he reckoned. For before the death and resurrection of the Lord, he both died when he denied, and returned to life when he wept; but he died, because he himself had been proud in his presumption, and he lived again, because that Other had looked on him with kindness.

For there is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory; and so also the resurrection of the dead.

For if it were not now called, it could not be then said, \"They shall gather out of His kingdom everything that offends.\" But the realm is not yet reigning. Accordingly it is already so far the kingdom, that when all offences shall have been gathered out of it, it shall then attain to sovereignty, so as to possess not merely the name of a kingdom, but also the power of government.

And as His own resurrection was in the immediate future, He put the word in the present tense to signify its speedy approach: but of theirs, as delayed till the end of the world, He said not, ye live; but, \"ye shall live.\" With elegance and brevity, therefore, by means of two words, one of them in the present tense and the other in the future, He gave the promise of two resurrections, to wit, His own in the immediate future, and ours as yet to come in the end of the world. \"Because I live,\" He says, \"ye shall live also:\" because He liveth, therefore shall we live also.

For \"from Adam\" is the word of Scripture, and not \"before Adam.\" Manes said: But tell me, I ask you in turn, how it obtained its kingdom over both the righteous and the sinful. Archelaus said: When you have first admitted that it has had that kingdom from a determinate time and not from eternity, I shall tell you that. Manes said: It is written, that \"death reigned from Adam to Moses.\" Archelaus said: And consequently it has an end, because it has had a beginning in time.[fn-35-P3527_965497:261-nf] And this saying is also true, that \"death is swallowed up in victory.\"[fn-35-P3528_965635:262-nf] It is apparent, then, that death cannot be unbegotten, seeing that it is shown to have both a beginning and an end.

And the law was called a \"ministration of death\" from the fact that then only transgressors of the law were punished, and not those who kept it, and who obeyed and observed the things which are in the law, as Abel did, whom Cain, who was made a vessel of the wicked one, slew. However, even after these things death wished to break the covenant which had been made by the instrumentality of Moses, and to reign again over the righteous; and with this object it did indeed assail the prophets, killing and stoning those who bad been sent by God, on to Zacharias. But my Lord Jesus, as maintaining the righteousness of the law of Moses, was wroth with death for its transgression of the covenant[fn-35-P3540_970703:272-nf] and of that whole ministration, and condescended to appear in the body of man, with the view of avenging not Himself, but Moses, and those who in a continuous succession after him had been oppressed by the violence of death. That wicked one, however, in ignorance of the meaning of a dispensation of this kind, entered into Judas, thinking to slay Him by that man's means, as before he had put righteous Abel to death. But when he had entered into Judas, be was overcome with penitence, and hanged himself; for which reason also the divine word says: \"O death, where is thy victory? O death,[fn-35-P3541_971343:273-nf] where is thy sting? \"And again: \"Death is swallowed up of victory.\"[fn-35-P3542_971424:274-nf] It is for this reason, therefore, that the law is called a \"ministration of death\" because it delivered sinners and transgressors over to death; but those who observed it, it defended from death; and these it also established in glory, by the help and aid of our Lord Jesus Christ.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-06","text":"34. I think that you cannot fail to understand this too, that the word \"father\" is but a single term indeed, and yet one admitting of being understood in various ways. For one is called father, as being the parent of those children whom he has begotten in a natural way; another is called father, as being the guardian of children whom he has but brought up; and some, again, are called fathers in respect of the privileged standing accruing through time or age. Hence our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is said to have a variety of fathers: for David was called His father, and Joseph was reckoned to be His father, while neither of these two was His father in respect of the actuality of nature. For David is called His father as touching the prerogative of time and age,[fn-35-P3594_998366:322-nf] and Joseph is designated His father as concerning the law of upbringing; but God Himself is His only Father by nature, who was pleased to make all things manifest in short space[fn-35-P3595_998583:323-nf] to us by His word. And our Lord Jesus Christ, making no tarrying,[fn-35-P3596_998667:324-nf] in the space of one year[fn-35-P3597_998724:325-nf] restored multitudes of the sick to health, and gave back the dead to the light of life; and He did indeed embrace all things in the power of His own word.[fn-35-P3598_999144:326-nf] And wherein, forsooth, did He make any tarrying, so that we should have to believe Him to have waited so long, even to these days, before He actually sent the Paraclete?[fn-35-P3599_999353:327-nf] Nay, rather, as has been already said above, He gave proof of His presence with us forthwith, and did most abundantly impart Himself to Paul, whose testimony we also believe when he says, \"Unto me only is this grace given.\"[fn-36-P3600_999677:328-nf] For this is he who formerly was a persecutor of the Church of God, but who afterwards appeared openly before all men as a faithful minister of the Paraclete; by whose instrumentality His singular clemency was made known to all men, in such wise that even to us who some time were without hope the largess of His gifts has come. For which of us could have hoped that Paul, the persecutor and enemy of the Church, would prove its defender and guardian? Yea, and not that alone, but that he would become also its ruler, the founder and architect of the churches? Wherefore after him, and after those who were with Himself-that is, the disciples-we are not to look for the advent of any other (such), according to the Scriptures; for our Lord Jesus Christ says of this Paraclete, \"He shall receive of mine.\"[fn-36-P3601_1000524:329-nf] Him therefore He selected as an acceptable vessel; and He sent this Paul to us in the Spirit. Into him the Spirit was poured;[fn-36-P3602_1000671:330-nf] and as that Spirit could not abide upon all men, but only on Him who was born of Mary the mother of God, so that Spirit, the Paraclete, could not come into any other, but could only come upon the apostles and the sainted Paul. \"For he is a chosen vessel,\" He says, \"unto me, to bear my name before kings and the Gentiles.\"[fn-36-P3603_1001283:331-nf] The apostle himself, too, states the same thing in his first epistle, where he says: \"According to the grace that is given to me of God, that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering[fn-36-P3604_1001546:332-nf] the Gospel of God.\"[fn-36-P3605_1001624:333-nf] \"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-36-P3606_1001745:334-nf] And again: \"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me by word and deed.\"[fn-36-P3607_1001883:335-nf] \"I am the last of all the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle. But by the grace of God I am what I am.\"[fn-36-P3608_1002022:336-nf] And it, is his wish to have to deal with[fn-36-P3609_1002240:337-nf] those who sought the proof of that Christ who spake in him, for this reason, that the Paraclete was in him: and as having obtained His gift of grace, and as being enriched with magnificent, honour,[fn-36-P3610_1002458:338-nf] he says: \"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-36-P3611_1002714:339-nf] Again, that it was the Paraclete Himself who was in Paul, is indicated by our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel, when He says: \"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray my Father, and He shall give you another Comforter.\"[fn-36-P3612_1002971:340-nf] In these words He points to the Paraclete Himself, for He speaks of \"another\" Comforter. And hence we have given credit to Paul, and have hearkened to him when he says, \"Or[fn-36-P3613_1003169:341-nf] seek ye a proof of Christ i speaking in me? \"[fn-36-P3614_1003227:342-nf] and when he expresses himself in similar terms, of which we have already spoken above. Thus, too, he seals his testament for us as for his faithful heirs, and like a father he addresses us in these words in his Epistle to the Corintians: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the eleven apostles:[fn-36-P3615_1003765:343-nf] after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that He was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the last of the apostles.\"[fn-36-P3616_1004100:344-nf] \"Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.\"[fn-36-P3617_1004213:345-nf] And again, in delivering over to his heirs that inheritance which he gained first himself, he says: \"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ,[fn-36-P3618_1004538:346-nf] whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another Spirit, which we have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. For I suppose that I did nothing less for you than the other apostles.\"[fn-36-P3619_1004791:347-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question. May it be well with you, incomparable and honourable father!","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-06","text":"43. I shall speak now with the utmost brevity of the veil of Moses and the ministration of death. For I do not think that these things at least can introduce very much to the disparagement of the law. The text in question,[fn-37-P3777_1061464:494-nf] then, proceeds thus: \"But if the ministration of death, engraven[fn-37-P3778_1061576:495-nf] in letters on the stones, was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; \"[fn-37-P3779_1061841:496-nf] and so on. Well, this passage at any rate acknowledges the existence of a glory on the countenance of Moses, and that surely is a fact favourable to our position. And even although it is to be done away. and although there is a veil in the reading of the same, that does not annoy me or disturb me, provided there be glory in it still. Neither is it the case, that whatever is to be done away is reduced thereby under all manner of circumstances to a condition of dishonour.[fn-37-P3780_1062338:497-nf] For when the Scripture speaks of glory, it shows us also that it had cognizance[fn-37-P3781_1062561:498-nf] of differences in glory. Thus it says: \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-37-P3782_1062878:499-nf] Although, then, the sun has a greater glory than the moon, it does not follow that the moon is thereby reduced to a condition of dishonour. And even thus, too, although my Lord Jesus Christ excelleth Moses in glory, as the lord excelleth the servant, it does not follow from this that the glory of Moses is to be scorned. For in this way, too, we are able to satisfy our hearers, as the nature of the word itself carries the conviction[fn-37-P3783_1063336:500-nf] with it in that we affirm what we allege on the authority of the Scriptures themselves, or verily make the proof of our statements all the clearer also by illustrations taken from them. Thus, although a person kindles a lamp in the night-time, after the sun has once risen he has no further need of the paltry light of his lamp, on account of that effulgence of the sun which sends forth its rays all the world over; and yet, for all that, the man does not throw his lamp contemptuously away, as if it were something absolutely antagonistic to the sun; but rather, when he has once found out its use, he will keep it with all the greater carefulness. Precisely in this way, then, the law of Moses served as a sort of guardian to the people, like the tamp, until the true Sun, who is our Saviour, should arise, even as the apostle also says to us: \"And Christ shall give thee light.\"[fn-37-P3784_1064350:501-nf] We must look, however, to what is said further on: \"Their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same veil in the reading of the Old Testament; it is untaken away, because it is done away in Christ.[fn-37-P3785_1064583:502-nf] For even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.\"[fn-37-P3786_1064812:503-nf] What, then, is meant by this? Is Moses present with us even unto this day? Is it the case that he has never slept, that he has never gone to his rest, that he has never departed this life? How is it that this phrase \"unto this day\" is used here? Well, only mark the veil, which is placed, where he says it is placed, on their hearts in their reading. This, therefore, is the word of censure upon the children of Israel, because they read Moses and yet do not understand him, and refuse to turn to the Lord; for it is He that was prophesied of by Moses as about to come. This, then, is the veil which was placed upon the face of Moses,[fn-37-P3787_1065473:504-nf] and this also is his testament;[fn-37-P3788_1065543:505-nf] for he says in the law:[fn-37-P3789_1065676:506-nf] \"A prince shall not be wanting from Judah, nor a leader from his thighs,[fn-37-P3790_1065774:507-nf] until He come whose he is;[fn-37-P3791_1066170:508-nf] and He will be the expectation of the nations: who shall bind[fn-37-P3792_1066609:509-nf] His foal unto the vine, and His ass's colt unto the choice vine; He shall wash His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes; His eyes shall be suffused[fn-37-P3793_1066879:510-nf] with wine, and His teeth white with milk; \"and so on. Moreover, he indicated who He was, and whence He was to come. For he said: \"The Lord God will raise up unto you, a Prophet from among your brethren, like unto me: unto Him hearken ye.\"[fn-37-P3794_1067259:511-nf] Now it is plain that this cannot be understood to have been said of Jesus the son of Nun.[fn-37-P3795_1067373:512-nf] For there is nothing of this circumcision[fn-37-P3796_1067610:513-nf] found in him. After him, too, there have still been kings from Judah; and consequently this prophecy is far from being applicable to him. And this is the veil which is on Moses; for it was not, as some among the unlearned perhaps fancy, any piece of linen cloth, or any skin that covered his face. But the apostle also takes care to make this plain to us, when he tells us that the veil is put on in the reading of the Old Testament, inasmuch as they who are called Israel from olden time still look for the coming of Christ, and perceive not that the princes have been wanting from Judah, and the leaders from his thighs; as even at present we see them in subjection to kings and princes, and paying tribute to these, without having any power left to them either of judgment or of punishment, such as Judah certainly had, for after he had condemned Thamar, he was able also to justify her.[fn-37-P3797_1068629:514-nf] \"But you will also see your life hang (in doubt) before your eyes.\"[fn-37-P3798_1068824:515-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"ANF-06","text":"49. But in addition to all that has been said already, I wish to adduce still further proof, so that all may understand what impiety is contained in this assertion of yours. For if your allegation is true, that He was not born, then it will follow undoubtedly that He did not suffer; for it is not possible for one to suffer who was not also born. But if He did not suffer, then the name of the cross is done away with. And if the cross was not endured, then Jesus did not rise from the dead. And if Jesus rose not from the dead, then no other person will rise again. And if no one shall rise again, then there will be no judgment. For it is certain that, if I am not to rise again, I cannot be judged. But if there is to be no judgment, then the keeping of God's commandments will be to no purpose, and there will be no occasion for abstinence: nay, we may say, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\"[fn-38-P3885_1105023:596-nf] For all these consequences follow when you deny that He was born of Mary. But if you acknowledge that He was born of Mary, then His passion will necessarily follow, and His resurrection will be consequent on His passion, and the judgment on His resurrection: and thus the injunctions of Scripture will have their proper value[fn-38-P3886_1105371:597-nf] for us. This is not therefore an idle question, but there are the mightiest issues involved in this word. For just as all the law and the prophets are summed up in two words, so also all our hope is made to depend on the birth by the blessed Mary. Give me therefore an answer to these several questions which I shall address to you. How shall we get rid of these many words of the apostle, so important and so precise, which are expressed in terms like the following: \"But when the good pleasure of God was with us, He sent His Son, made of a woman; \"[fn-38-P3887_1105938:598-nf] and again, \"Christ our passover is sacrificed for us; \"[fn-38-P3888_1106264:599-nf] and once more, \"God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise up us together with Him by His own power? \"[fn-38-P3889_1106393:600-nf] And there are many other passages of a similar import; as, for example, this which follows: \"How say some among you,[fn-38-P3890_1106855:601-nf] that there is no resurrection of the dead? For if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain. Yea, and we shall be found false witnesses of God; who have testified against God that He raised up Christ: whom He raised not up. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ risen: and if Christ be not raised, your[fn-38-P3891_1107328:602-nf] faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins: Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable than all men. But now is Christ risen from the dead, the beginning[fn-38-P3892_1107639:603-nf] of them that sleep; \"[fn-38-P3893_1107677:604-nf] and so on. Who, then, I ask, can be found so rash and audacious as not to make his faith fit in with these sacred words, in which there is no qualification[fn-38-P3894_1107858:605-nf] nor any dubiety? Who, I ask you, O foolish Galatian, has bewitched you, as those were bewitched \"before whose eyes Jesus Christ was evidently set forth, crucified? \"[fn-38-P3895_1108043:606-nf] From all this I think that these testimonies should suffice in proof of the judgment, and the resurrection, and the passion; and the birth by Mary is also shown to be involved naturally and at once in these facts. And what matters it though you refuse to acquiesce in this, when the Scripture proclaims the fact most unmistakeably? Nevertheless I shall again put a question to you, and let it please you to give me an answer. When Jesus gave His testimony concerning John, and said, \"Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is less[fn-38-P3896_1108777:607-nf] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,\"[fn-38-P3897_1108837:608-nf] tell me what is meant by there being a greater than he in the kingdom of heaven. Was Jesus less in the kingdom of heaven than John? I say, God forbid! Tell me, then, how this is to be explained, and you will certainly surpass yourself. Without doubt the meaning is, that Jesus was less than John among those that are born of woman; but in the kingdom of heaven He is greater than he.[fn-38-P3898_1109242:609-nf] Wherefore tell me this too, O Manichaeus: If you say that Christ was not born of Mary, but that He only appeared like a man, while yet He was not really a man, the appearance being effected and produced by the power that is in Him, tell me, I repeat, on whom then was it that the Spirit descended like a dove? Who is this that was baptized by John? If He was perfect, if He was the Son, if He was the Power, the Spirit could not have entered into Him;[fn-38-P3899_1109977:610-nf] just as a kingdom cannot enter within a kingdom. And whose, too, was that voice which was sent forth out of heaven, and which gave Him this testimony, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased? \"[fn-39-P3900_1110992:611-nf] Come, tell me; make no delay; who is this that acquires[fn-39-P3901_1111070:612-nf] all these things, that does all these things?

Was Jesus less in the kingdom of heaven than John? I say, God forbid! Tell me, then, how this is to be explained, and you will certainly surpass yourself. Without doubt the meaning is, that Jesus was less than John among those that are born of woman; but in the kingdom of heaven He is greater than he.[fn-38-P3898_1109242:609-nf] Wherefore tell me this too, O Manichaeus: If you say that Christ was not born of Mary, but that He only appeared like a man, while yet He was not really a man, the appearance being effected and produced by the power that is in Him, tell me, I repeat, on whom then was it that the Spirit descended like a dove? Who is this that was baptized by John? If He was perfect, if He was the Son, if He was the Power, the Spirit could not have entered into Him;[fn-38-P3899_1109977:610-nf] just as a kingdom cannot enter within a kingdom. And whose, too, was that voice which was sent forth out of heaven, and which gave Him this testimony, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased? \"[fn-39-P3900_1110992:611-nf] Come, tell me; make no delay; who is this that acquires[fn-39-P3901_1111070:612-nf] all these things, that does all these things?

And hence that the disturbed minds of the disciples might not be racked by prolonged grief, He with such wondrous speed shortened the three days' delay which He had announced, that by joining the last part of the first and the first part of the third day to the whole of the second, He cut off a considerable portion of the period, and yet did not lessen the number of days. The Saviour's Resurrection therefore did not long keep His soul in Hades, nor His flesh in the tomb; and so speedy was the quickening of His uncorrupted flesh that it bore a closer resemblance to slumber than to death, seeing that the Godhead, Which quitted not either part of the Human Nature which He had assumed, reunited by Its power that which Its power had separated[fn-38-P3844_973978:7-nf] .","title":"Sermon LXXI.

But when He said in this way here, \"This is my commandment,\" as if there were none else, what are we to think, my brethren? Is, then, the commandment about that love wherewith we love one another, His only one? Is there not also another that is still greater,-that we should love God? Or has God in very truth given us such a charge about love alone, that we have no need of searching for others? There are three things at least that the apostle commends when he says, \"But now abide faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\"[fn-29-P2929_1676881:6-nf] And although in charity, that is, in love, are comprehended the two commandments; yet it is here declared to be the greatest only, and not the sole one. Accordingly, what a host of commandments are given us about faith, what a multitude about hope! who is there that could collect them together, or suffice to number them? But let us ponder the words of the same apostle: \"Love is the fullness of the law.\"[fn-29-P2930_1677308:7-nf] And so, where there is love, what can be wanting? and where it is not, what is there that can possibly be profitable? The devil believes,[fn-29-P2931_1677464:8-nf] but does not love: no one loveth who doth not believe. One may, indeed, hope for pardon who does not love, but he hopes in vain; but no one can despair who loves. Therefore, where there is love, there of necessity will there be faith and hope; and where there is the love of our neighbor, there also of necessity will be the love of God. For he that loveth not God, how loveth he his neighbour as himself, seeing that he loveth not even himself? Such an one is both impious and iniquitous; and he that loveth iniquity, manifestly loveth not, but hateth his own soul.[fn-29-P2932_1678047:9-nf] Let us, therefore, be holding fast to this precept of the Lord, to love one another; and then all else that is commanded we shall do, for all else we have contained in this. But this love is distinguished from that which men bear to one another as such; for in order to mark the distinction, it is added, \"as I have loved you.\" And wherefore is it that Christ loveth us, but that we may be fitted to reign with Christ? With this aim, therefore, let us also be loving one another, that we may manifest the difference of our love from that of others, who have no such motive in loving one another, because the love itself is wanting. But those whose mutual love has the possession of God Himself for its object, will truly love one another; and, therefore, even for the very purpose of loving one another, they love God. There is no such love as this in all men; for few have this motive for their love one to another, that God may be all in all.[fn-29-P2933_1679351:10-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":53,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_220_sermon_xcv_a_homily_on_the_beatitudes_st_matt_v_1_9_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Next the Lord says: \"blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the earth by inheritance[fn-42-P4227_1084538:16-nf] .\" To the meek and gentle, to the humble and modest, and to those who are prepared to endure all injuries, the earth is promised for their possession.

Our Saviour's holy disciples, after getting beyond the limits of human thought, and then being purified by the word,[fn-27-P2701_907540:45-nf] are enquiring about the end, and longing to know the ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His angels and to Himself. He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of God, a day; and the contemplation of the One-ness and Unity, knowledge of which He attributes to the Father alone, an hour. I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to know of Himself what is; and not to know what is not God, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is said to know righteousness and wisdom; but to be ignorant of unrighteousness and wickedness; for God who created us is not unrighteousness and wickedness. If, then, God is said to know about Himself that which is, and not to know that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the purpose of the Incarnation and the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then our Saviour does not know the end and the ultimate blessedness. But He says the angels do not know;[fn-27-P2702_908562:46-nf] that is to say, not even the contemplation which is in them, nor the methods of their ministries are the ultimate object of desire. For even their knowledge, when compared with the knowledge which is face to face, is dense.[fn-27-P2703_908806:47-nf] Only the Father, He says, knows, since He is Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer know God in mirrors and not immediately,[fn-27-P2704_909839:48-nf] but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall know even the ultimate end. For all material knowledge is said to be the kingdom of Christ; while immaterial knowledge, and so to say the knowledge of actual Godhead, is that of God the Father. But our Lord is also Himself the end anti the ultimate blessedness according to the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the Gospel? \"I will raise him up at the last day.\"[fn-27-P2705_910453:49-nf] He calls the transition from material knowledge to immaterial contemplation a resurrection, speaking of that knowledge after which there is no other, as the last day: for our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at the time when it contemplates the One-ness and Unity of the Word. But since our intelligence is made dense and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and incapable of gazing intently in pure contemplation, being led through adornments[fn-27-P2706_910957:50-nf] cognate to its own body. It considers the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by their effects, to the end that growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to approach even the actual unveiled Godhead. This is the meaning, I think, of the words \"my Father is greater than I,\"[fn-27-P2707_911834:51-nf] and also of the statement, \"It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.\"[fn-27-P2708_911957:52-nf] This too is what is meant by Christ's \"delivering up the kingdom to God even the Father;\"[fn-27-P2709_912091:53-nf] inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is regarded relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first fruits. It is in accordance with this view that when His disciples asked Him again in the Acts of the Apostles, \"When wilt thou restore the kingdom of Israel?\" He replied, \"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.\"[fn-27-P2710_912532:54-nf] That is to say, the knowledge of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and blood. This contemplation the Father hath put away in His own power, meaning by \"power\" those that are empowered, and by \"His own\" those who are not held down by the ignorance of things below. Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain distinctions of knowledge made by the sun apprehended by mental perception. For our Lord's prayer must be carried out. It is Jesus Who prayed \"Grant that they may be one in us as I and Thou are one, Father.\"[fn-27-P2711_913115:55-nf] For when God, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and number is lost in the in-dwelling of Unity.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":15,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_26_letter_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"8.

For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one man's obedience shall many be made righteous[fn-14-P1474_360996:7-nf] ;\" and again, \"For because by man (came) death, by man also (came) the resurrection of the dead.

For the flesh of Christ is the veil of the Word, wherewith every one is clothed who confesses Him unreservedly. But he that is ashamed of it and rejects it as unworthy, shall have no adornment from Him, and though he present i himself at the Royal feast, and unseasonably join in the sacred banquet, yet the intruder will not be able to escape the King's discernment, but, as the Lord Himself asserted, will be taken, and with hands and feet bound, be cast into outer darkness; where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth[fn-14-P1477_362288:10-nf] . Hence whosoever confesses not the human body in Christ, must know that he is unworthy of the mystery of the Incarnation, and has no share in that sacred union of which the Apostle speaks, saying, \"For we are His members, of His flesh and of His bones.
