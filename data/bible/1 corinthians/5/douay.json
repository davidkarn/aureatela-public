{"verses":["It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and\nsuch fornication as the like is not among the heathens:  that one should\nhave his father's wife.","And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned:  that he might\nbe taken away from among you that hath done this thing.","I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already\njudged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,","In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together\nand my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:","To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,\nthat the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Your glorying is not good.  Know you not that a little leaven\ncorrupteth the whole lump?","Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are\nunleavened.  For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.","Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the\nleaven of malice and wickedness:  but with the unleavened bread of\nsincerity and truth.","I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the\ncovetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols:  otherwise you\nmust needs go out of this world.","But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man\nthat is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of\nidols or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner:  with such a one, not\nso much as to eat.","For what have I to do to judge them that are without?  Do not you\njudge them that are within?","For them that are without, God will judge.  Put away the evil one\nfrom among yourselves."]}
