Else, if of all blasphemy it has been said, \"By your means My Name is blasphemed,\"[fn-7-P751_311084:101-nf] we all perish at once; since the whole circus, with no desert of ours, assails \"the Name\" with wicked suffrages. Let us cease (to be Christians) and it will not be blasphemed! On the contrary, while we are, let it be blasphemed: in the observance, not the overstepping, of discipline; while we are being approved, not while we are being reprobated. Oh blasphemy, bordering on martyrdom, which now attests me to be a Christian,[fn-7-P752_311585:102-nf] while for that very account it detests me! The cursing of well-maintained Discipline is a blessing of the Name. \"If,\" says he, \"I wished to please men, I should not be Christ's servant.\"[fn-7-P753_311909:103-nf] But the same apostle elsewhere bids us take care to please all: \"As I,\" he says, \"please all by all means.\"[fn-7-P754_312046:104-nf] No doubt he used to please them by celebrating the Saturnalia and New-year's day! [Was it so] or was it by moderation and patience? by gravity, by kindness, by integrity? In like manner, when he is saying, \"I have become all things to all, that I may gain all,\"[fn-7-P755_312332:105-nf] does he mean \"to idolaters an idolater? \"\"to heathens a heathen? \"\"to the worldly worldly? \"But albeit he does not prohibit us from having our conversation with idolaters and adulterers, and the other criminals, saying, \"Otherwise ye would go out from the world,\"[fn-7-P756_312618:106-nf] of course he does not so slacken those reins of conversation that, since it is necessary for us both to live and to mingle with sinners, we may be able to sin with them too. Where there is the intercourse of life, which the apostle concedes, there is sinning, which no one permits. To live with heathens is lawful, to die with them[fn-7-P757_312972:107-nf] is not. Let us live with all;[fn-7-P758_313069:108-nf] let us be glad with them, out of community of nature, not of superstition. We are peers in soul, not in discipline; fellow-possessors of the world, not of error. But if we have no right of communion in matters of this kind with strangers, how far more wicked to celebrate them among brethren! Who can maintain or defend this? The Holy Spirit upbraids the Jews with their holy-days. \"Your Sabbaths, and new moons, and ceremonies,\" says He, \"My soul hateth.\"[fn-7-P759_313635:109-nf] By us, to whom Sabbaths are strange,[fn-7-P760_313696:110-nf] and the new moons and festivals formerly beloved by God, the Saturnalia and New-year's and Midwinter's festivals and Matronalia are frequented-presents come and go-New-year's gifts-games join their noise-banquets join their din! Oh better fidelity of the nations to their own sect, which claims no solemnity of the Christians for itself! Not the Lord's day, not Pentecost, even it they had known them, would they have shared with us; for they would fear lest they should seem to be Christians. We are not apprehensive lest we seem to be heathens! If any indulgence is to be granted to the flesh, you have it. I will not say your own days,[fn-7-P761_314486:111-nf] but more too; for to the heathens each festive day occurs but once annually: you have a festive day every eighth day.[fn-7-P762_314747:112-nf] Call out the individual solemnities of the nations, and set them out into a row, they will not be able to make up a Pentecost.[fn-7-P763_314921:113-nf] ","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_07_on_idolatry_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Amid these reefs and inlets, amid these shallows and straits of idolatry, Faith, her sails filled by the Spirit of God, navigates; safe if cautious, secure if intently watchful.

Driven from this line of defence you will appeal to the example of the clergy. These, you will say, remain in their cities, and yet they are surely above criticism. Far be it from me to censure the successors of the apostles, who with holy words consecrate the body of Christ, and who make us Christians.[fn-4-P425_78672:217-nf] Having the keys of the kingdom of heaven, they judge men to some extent before the day of judgment, and guard the chastity of the bride of Christ. But, as I have before hinted, the case of monks is different from that of the clergy. The clergy feed Christ's sheep; I as a monk am fed by them.

And let these also first be proved; then, let them minister, being found blameless.\"[fn-4-P434_80780:226-nf] Woe to the man who goes in to the supper without a wedding garment.

Let it be your care, therefore, to set forth the course of the matter to all the bishops throughout Isauria and Pamphylia and the rest of the neighbouring provinces: moreover, if you think fit, you can add my letter, so that all of us gathered together in one spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ may deliver these men unto Satan for the destruction of the impiety which possesses them.[fn-36-P3647_981203:2632-nf] And to ensure the speedy arrival of my despatches at Constantinople, send a diligent messenger, one of the clergy (as I send fathers from the monasteries of Nitria with others also of the monks, learned men and continent) that when they arrive they may be able themselves to relate what has been done. Above all I beg of you to offer up earnest prayers to the Lord that we may be able in this contest also to gain the victory; for no small joy has filled the hearts of the people both in Alexandria and throughout all Egypt, because a few men have been expelled from the Church that the body of it might be kept pure.

Innumerable instances of the same kind are to be found in the sacred books. But, to be brief, I will return to the last of the four classes of brethren, those, namely, who are brethren by affection, and these again fall into two divisions, those of the spiritual and those of the general relationship. I say spiritual because all of us Christians are called brethren, as in the verse,[fn-60-P6082_1813752:65-nf] \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.\" And in another psalm the Saviour says,[fn-60-P6083_1813895:66-nf] \"I will declare thy name unto my brethren.\" And elsewhere,[fn-60-P6084_1813973:67-nf] \"Go unto my brethren and say to them.\" I say also general, because we are all children of one Father, there is a like bond of brotherhood between us all.[fn-60-P6085_1814148:68-nf] \"Tell these who hate you,\" says the prophet, \"ye are our brethren.\" And the Apostle writing to the Corinthians:[fn-60-P6086_1814278:69-nf] \"If any man that is named brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one no, not to eat.\" I now ask to which class you consider the Lord's brethren in the Gospel must be assigned. They are brethren by nature, you say. But Scripture does not say so; it calls them neither sons of Mary, nor of Joseph. Shall we say they are brethren by race? But it is absurd to suppose that a few Jews were called His brethren when all Jews of the time might upon this principle have borne the title. Were they brethren by virtue of close intimacy and the union of heart and mind? If that were so, who were more truly His brethren than the apostles who received His private instruction and were called by Him His mother and His brethren? Again, if all men, as such, were His brethren, it would have been foolish to deliver a special message, \"Behold, thy brethren seek thee,\" for all men alike were entitled to the name. The only alternative is to adopt the previous explanation and understand them to be called brethren in virtue of the bond of kindred, not of love and sympathy, nor by prerogative of race, nor yet by nature. Just as Lot was called Abraham's brother, and Jacob Laban's, just as the daughters of Zelophehad received a lot among their brethren, just as Abraham himself had to wife Sarah his sister, for he says,[fn-60-P6087_1815679:70-nf] \"She is indeed my sister, on the father's side, not on the mother's,\" that is to say, she was the daughter of his brother, not of his sister. Otherwise, what are we to say of Abraham, a just man, taking to wife the daughter of his own father? Scripture, in relating the history of the men of early times, does not outrage our ears by speaking of the enormity in express terms, but prefers to leave it to be inferred by the reader: and God afterwards gives to the prohibition the sanction of the law, and threatens,[fn-60-P6088_1816213:71-nf] \"He who takes his sister, born of his father, or of his mother, and beholds her nakedness, hath commited abomination, he shall be utterly destroyed.

The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either.

There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin.

Of course the question in hand concerned some moderate indulgence; which (moderation in the indulgence) was now, if ever, to be divined, when it is usual for all the greatest indulgences not to be granted without public proclamation, so far (are they from being granted) without particularization. Why, do you yourself, when introducing into the church, for the purpose of melting the brotherhood by his prayers, the repentant adulterer, lead into the midst and prostrate him, all in haircloth and ashes, a compound of disgrace and horror, before the widows, before the elders, suing for the tears of all, licking the footprints of all, clasping the knees of all?

And would the apostle so carelessly have granted indulgence to the atrocious licentiousness of fornication burdened with incest, as not at least to have exacted from the criminal even this legally established garb of repentance which you ought to have learned from him? as to have uttered no commination on the past? no allocution touching the future? Nay, more; he goes further, and beseeches that they \"would confirm toward him affection,\" as if he were making satisfaction to him, not as if he were granting an indulgence! And yet I hear (him speak of) \"affection,\" not \"communion; \"as (he writes) withal to the Thessalonians \"But if any obey not our word through the epistle, him mark; and associate not with him, that he may feel awed; not regarding (him) as an enemy, but rebuking as a brother.\"[fn-14-P1458_419119:129-nf] Accordingly, he could have said that to a fornicator, too, \"affection\" only was conceded, not \"communion \"as well; to an incestuous man, however, not even \"affection; \"whom he would, to be sure, have bidden to be banished from their midst[fn-14-P1459_419387:130-nf] -much more, of course, from their mind. \"But he was apprehensive lest they should be `overreached by Satan' with regard to the loss of that person whom himself had cast forth to Satan; or else lest, `by abundance of mourning, he should be devoured' whom he had sentenced to `destruction of the flesh.'\" Here they go so far as to interpret \"destruction of the flesh\" the office of repentance; in that by fasts, and squalor, and every species of neglect and studious ill-treatment devoted to the extermination of the flesh, it seems to make satisfaction to God; so that they argue that that fornicator-that incestuous person rather-having been delivered by the apostle to Satan, not with a view to \"perdition,\" but with a view to \"emendation,\" on the hypothesis that subsequently he would, on account of the \"destruction\" (that is, the general affliction) \"of the flesh,\" attain pardon, therefore did actually attain it. Plainly, the selfsame apostle delivered to Satan Hymenaeus and Alexander, \"that they might be emended into not blaspheming,\"[fn-14-P1460_420457:131-nf] as he writes to his Timotheus. \"But withal himself says that `a stake[fn-14-P1461_420548:132-nf] was given him, an angel of Satan, 'by which he was to be buffeted, lest he should exalt himself\" If they touch upon this (instance) withal, in order to lead us to understand that such as were \"delivered to Sam\" by him (were so delivered) with a view to emendation, not to perdition; what similarity is there between blasphemy and incest, and a soul entirely free from these,-nay, rather elated from no other source than the highest sanctity and all innocence; which (elation of soul) was being restrained in the apostle by \"buffets,\" if you will, by means (as they say) of pain in the ear or head? Incest, however, and blasphemy, deserved to have delivered the entire persons of men to Satan himself for a possession, not to \"an angel\" of his. And (there is yet another point): for about this it makes a difference, nay, rather withal in regard to this it is of the utmost consequence, that we find those men delivered by the apostle to Satan, but to the apostle himself an angel of Satan given. Lastly, when Paul is praying the Lord for its removal, what does he hear? \"Hold my grace sufficient; for virtue is perfected in infirmity.\"[fn-14-P1462_421709:133-nf] This they who are surrendered to Satan cannot hear. Moreover, if the crime of Hymenaeus and Alexander-blasphemy, to wit-is irremissible in this and in the future. age,[fn-14-P1463_421926:134-nf] of course the apostle would not, in opposition to the determinate decision of the Lord, have given to Satan, under a hope of pardon, men already sunken from the faith into blasphemy; whence, too, he pronounced them \"shipwrecked with regard to faith,\"[fn-14-P1464_422211:135-nf] having no longer the solace of the ship, the Church. For to those who, after believing, have struck upon (the rock of) blasphemy, pardon is denied; on the other hand, heathens and heretics are daily emerging out of blasphemy. But even if he did say, \"I delivered them to Satan, that they might receive the discipline of not blaspheming,\" he said it of the rest, who, by their deliverance to Satan-that is, their projection outside the Church-had to be trained in the knowledge that there must be no blaspheming. So, therefore, the incestuous fornicator, too, he delivered, not with a view to emendation, but with a view to perdition, to Satan, to whom he had already, by sinning above an heathen, gone over; that they might learn there must be no fornicating. Finally, he says, \"for the destruction of the flesh,\" not its \"torture\"-condemning the actual substance through which he had fallen out (of the faith), which substance had already perished immediately on the loss of baptism-\" in order that the spirit,\" he says, \"may be saved in the day of the Lord.\" And (here, again, is a difficulty): for let this point be inquired into, whether the man's own spirit will be saved. In that case, a spirit polluted with so great a wickedness will be saved; the object of the perdition of the flesh being, that the spirit may be saved in penalty. In that case, the interpretation which is contrary to ours will recognise a penalty without the flesh, if we lose the resurrection of the flesh. It remains, therefore, that his meaning was, that that spirit which is accounted to exist in the Church must be presented \"saved,\" that is, untainted by the contagion of impurities in the day of the Lord, by the ejection of the incestuous fornicator; if, that is, he subjoins: \"Know ye not, that a little leaven spoileth the savour of the whole lump? \"[fn-14-P1465_424072:136-nf] And yet incestuous fornication was not a little, but a large, leaven.","title":"VII.

And do you, good shepherd and blessed father that you are, to bring about the (desired) end of the man, grace your harangue with all the allurements of mercy in your power, and under the parable of the \"ewe\" go in quest of your goats?[fn-14-P1457_418046:128-nf] do you, for fear lest your \"ewe\" again take a leap out from the flock-as if that were no more lawful for the future which was not even once lawful-fill all the rest likewise full of apprehension at the very moment of granting indulgence? And would the apostle so carelessly have granted indulgence to the atrocious licentiousness of fornication burdened with incest, as not at least to have exacted from the criminal even this legally established garb of repentance which you ought to have learned from him? as to have uttered no commination on the past? no allocution touching the future? Nay, more; he goes further, and beseeches that they \"would confirm toward him affection,\" as if he were making satisfaction to him, not as if he were granting an indulgence! And yet I hear (him speak of) \"affection,\" not \"communion; \"as (he writes) withal to the Thessalonians \"But if any obey not our word through the epistle, him mark; and associate not with him, that he may feel awed; not regarding (him) as an enemy, but rebuking as a brother.\"[fn-14-P1458_419119:129-nf] Accordingly, he could have said that to a fornicator, too, \"affection\" only was conceded, not \"communion \"as well; to an incestuous man, however, not even \"affection; \"whom he would, to be sure, have bidden to be banished from their midst[fn-14-P1459_419387:130-nf] -much more, of course, from their mind. \"But he was apprehensive lest they should be `overreached by Satan' with regard to the loss of that person whom himself had cast forth to Satan; or else lest, `by abundance of mourning, he should be devoured' whom he had sentenced to `destruction of the flesh.'\" Here they go so far as to interpret \"destruction of the flesh\" the office of repentance; in that by fasts, and squalor, and every species of neglect and studious ill-treatment devoted to the extermination of the flesh, it seems to make satisfaction to God; so that they argue that that fornicator-that incestuous person rather-having been delivered by the apostle to Satan, not with a view to \"perdition,\" but with a view to \"emendation,\" on the hypothesis that subsequently he would, on account of the \"destruction\" (that is, the general affliction) \"of the flesh,\" attain pardon, therefore did actually attain it. Plainly, the selfsame apostle delivered to Satan Hymenaeus and Alexander, \"that they might be emended into not blaspheming,\"[fn-14-P1460_420457:131-nf] as he writes to his Timotheus. \"But withal himself says that `a stake[fn-14-P1461_420548:132-nf] was given him, an angel of Satan, 'by which he was to be buffeted, lest he should exalt himself\" If they touch upon this (instance) withal, in order to lead us to understand that such as were \"delivered to Sam\" by him (were so delivered) with a view to emendation, not to perdition; what similarity is there between blasphemy and incest, and a soul entirely free from these,-nay, rather elated from no other source than the highest sanctity and all innocence; which (elation of soul) was being restrained in the apostle by \"buffets,\" if you will, by means (as they say) of pain in the ear or head? Incest, however, and blasphemy, deserved to have delivered the entire persons of men to Satan himself for a possession, not to \"an angel\" of his. And (there is yet another point): for about this it makes a difference, nay, rather withal in regard to this it is of the utmost consequence, that we find those men delivered by the apostle to Satan, but to the apostle himself an angel of Satan given. Lastly, when Paul is praying the Lord for its removal, what does he hear? \"Hold my grace sufficient; for virtue is perfected in infirmity.\"[fn-14-P1462_421709:133-nf] This they who are surrendered to Satan cannot hear. Moreover, if the crime of Hymenaeus and Alexander-blasphemy, to wit-is irremissible in this and in the future. age,[fn-14-P1463_421926:134-nf] of course the apostle would not, in opposition to the determinate decision of the Lord, have given to Satan, under a hope of pardon, men already sunken from the faith into blasphemy; whence, too, he pronounced them \"shipwrecked with regard to faith,\"[fn-14-P1464_422211:135-nf] having no longer the solace of the ship, the Church. For to those who, after believing, have struck upon (the rock of) blasphemy, pardon is denied; on the other hand, heathens and heretics are daily emerging out of blasphemy. But even if he did say, \"I delivered them to Satan, that they might receive the discipline of not blaspheming,\" he said it of the rest, who, by their deliverance to Satan-that is, their projection outside the Church-had to be trained in the knowledge that there must be no blaspheming. So, therefore, the incestuous fornicator, too, he delivered, not with a view to emendation, but with a view to perdition, to Satan, to whom he had already, by sinning above an heathen, gone over; that they might learn there must be no fornicating. Finally, he says, \"for the destruction of the flesh,\" not its \"torture\"-condemning the actual substance through which he had fallen out (of the faith), which substance had already perished immediately on the loss of baptism-\" in order that the spirit,\" he says, \"may be saved in the day of the Lord.\" And (here, again, is a difficulty): for let this point be inquired into, whether the man's own spirit will be saved. In that case, a spirit polluted with so great a wickedness will be saved; the object of the perdition of the flesh being, that the spirit may be saved in penalty. In that case, the interpretation which is contrary to ours will recognise a penalty without the flesh, if we lose the resurrection of the flesh. It remains, therefore, that his meaning was, that that spirit which is accounted to exist in the Church must be presented \"saved,\" that is, untainted by the contagion of impurities in the day of the Lord, by the ejection of the incestuous fornicator; if, that is, he subjoins: \"Know ye not, that a little leaven spoileth the savour of the whole lump? \"[fn-14-P1465_424072:136-nf] And yet incestuous fornication was not a little, but a large, leaven.","title":"VII.

Now the friendly understanding you will have to carry out must arise from your observance of the compact: you must never think of getting back any of the things which you have abjured, and have restored to him, lest he should summon you as a fraudulent man, and a transgressor of your agreement, before God the Judge (for in this light do we read of him, in another passage, as \"the accuser of the brethren,\"[fn-29-P2919_1024395:246-nf] or saints, where reference is made to the actual practice of legal prosecution); and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection.[fn-29-P2920_1024757:247-nf] What can be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation? If, however, according to Carpocrates, the soul is bound to the commission of all sorts of crime and evil conduct, what must we from his system understand to be its \"adversary\" and foe? I suppose it must be that better mind which shall compel it by force to the performance of some act of virtue, that it may be driven from body to body, until it be found in none a debtor to the claims of a virtuous life. This means, that a good tree is known by its bad fruit-in other words, that the doctrine of truth is understood from the worst possible precepts. I apprehend[fn-29-P2921_1025621:248-nf] that heretics of this school seize with especial avidity the example of Elias, whom they assume to have been so reproduced in John (the Baptist) as to make our Lord's statement sponsor for their theory of transmigration, when He said, \"Elias is come already, and they knew him not; \"[fn-29-P2922_1025919:249-nf] and again, in another passage, \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\"[fn-29-P2923_1026040:250-nf] Well, then, was it really in a Pythagorean sense that the Jews approached John with the inquiry, \"Art thou Elias? \"[fn-29-P2924_1026177:251-nf] and not rather in the sense of the divine prediction, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah\" the Tisbite?[fn-29-P2925_1026297:252-nf] The fact, however, is, that their metempsychosis, or transmigration theory, signifies the recall of the soul which had died long before, and its return to some other body. But Elias is to come again, not after quitting life (in the way of dying), but after his translation (or removal without dying); not for the purpose of being restored to the body, from which he had not departed, but for the purpose of revisiting the world from which he was translated; not by way of resuming a life which he had laid aside, but of fulfilling prophecy,-really and truly the same man, both in respect of his name and designation, as well as of his unchanged humanity. How, therefore could John be Elias? You have your answer in the angel's announcement: \"And he shall go before the people,\" says he, \"in the spirit and power of Elias\"-not (observe) in his soul and his body. These substances are, in fact, the natural property of each individual; whilst \"the spirit and power\" are bestowed as external gifts by the grace of God and so may be transferred to another person according to the purpose and will of the Almighty, as was anciently the case with respect to the spirit of Moses.[fn-29-P2926_1027489:253-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_14_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"108","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"76.

Then at last they left their boats, and followed Him, understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had declared. It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his Antitheses, that the position of Marcion derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial care,[fn-54-P5495_1691419:234-nf] as a proof in his domain,[fn-54-P5496_1691476:235-nf] a certain companion in misery (suntalai/pwron), and associate in hatred (summisou/menon), with himself, for the cure of leprosy,[fn-54-P5497_1691643:236-nf] I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a leper (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food,[fn-54-P5498_1692043:237-nf] forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious: wherever a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the law should be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by carnal facts[fn-54-P5499_1692312:238-nf] -and thus[fn-55-P5500_1692363:239-nf] not destroying, but rather building up, that law which He wanted to have more earnestly acknowledged-touched the leper, by whom (even although as man He might have been defiled) He could not be defiled as God, being of course incorruptible. The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not cause defilement to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy[fn-55-P5501_1692972:240-nf] of the law that He touched the leper-disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement-how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body[fn-55-P5502_1693147:241-nf] which could be defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity[fn-55-P5503_1693527:242-nf] for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue. If, however, the Creator's prophet Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone,[fn-55-P5504_1693778:243-nf] to the exclusion of[fn-55-P5505_1693813:244-nf] so many lepers in Israel,[fn-55-P5506_1693890:245-nf] this fact contributes nothing to the distinction of Christ, as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing this Israelite leper, although a stranger to him, whom his own Lord had been unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather[fn-55-P5507_1694185:246-nf] was significant throughout the nations of the world[fn-55-P5508_1694280:247-nf] of their own cleansing in Christ their light,[fn-55-P5509_1694611:248-nf] steeped as they were in the stains of the seven deadly sins:[fn-55-P5510_1694770:249-nf] idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery, fornication, false-witness, and fraud.[fn-55-P5511_1694876:250-nf] Seven times, therefore, as if once for each,[fn-55-P5512_1696020:251-nf] did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might celebrate the expiation of a perfect hebdomad;[fn-55-P5513_1696153:252-nf] and because the virtue and fulness of the one baptism was thus solemnly imputed[fn-55-P5514_1696293:253-nf] to Christ, alone, who was one day to establish on earth not only a revelation, but also a baptism, endued with compendious efficacy.[fn-55-P5515_1696444:254-nf] Even Marcion finds here an antithesis:[fn-55-P5516_1696636:255-nf] how that Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied water, and that seven times; whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that but once for all, instantly effected[fn-55-P5517_1696845:256-nf] the cure. And surely I might venture[fn-55-P5518_1696905:257-nf] to claim[fn-55-P5519_1696939:258-nf] the Very Word also as of the Creator's substance. There is nothing of which He who was the primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth,[fn-55-P5520_1697113:259-nf] it is incredible that that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a single malady, which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the world! From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha-because, in fact, the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground that He was once more powerful than a servant of the Creator-since, in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater![fn-55-P5521_1697999:260-nf] For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has simply done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man to publish abroad the cure; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested that the usual course should be followed: \"Go, show thyself to the priest, and present the offering which Moses commanded.\"[fn-55-P5522_1698604:261-nf] For the figurative signs of the law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.[fn-55-P5523_1698737:262-nf] These types signified that a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified[fn-55-P5524_1698836:263-nf] from the stains thereof by the word of God, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, who is the Catholic Priest of the Father.[fn-55-P5525_1699056:264-nf] Accordingly He added: \"that it may be for a testimony unto you\"-one, no doubt, whereby He would testify that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake[fn-55-P5526_1699421:265-nf] their sicknesses and infirmities. This very consistent and becoming explanation of \"the testimony,\" that adulator of his own Christ, Marcion seeks to exclude under the cover of mercy and gentleness. For, being both good (such are his words), and knowing, besides, that every man who had been freed from leprosy would be sure to perform the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept. Well, what then? Has He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the law) or not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer of the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because there would not exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his claim to belong to the other god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a subsequent destruction of the law, it is a false testimony which he has since imposed upon them in his cure of the leper; because he has forsaken his goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was good whilst upholding the law,[fn-55-P5527_1700511:266-nf] he has now become evil as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was good. For no one permits himself in the support of an evil thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted obedience to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared[fn-55-P5528_1700843:267-nf] as the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift because he knew that every cured leper would be sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously done. In vain, therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying the law, when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet,[fn-55-P5529_1701238:268-nf] because he knew their disposition,[fn-55-P5530_1701288:269-nf] he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect of the law,[fn-55-P5531_1701375:270-nf] since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, that man might of his own simple will obey the law? For then might he have seemed to some extent[fn-55-P5532_1701566:271-nf] to have persisted in his patience. But he adds also his own authority increased by the weight of this \"testimony.\" Of what testimony, I ask,[fn-55-P5533_1701727:272-nf] if not that of the assertion of the law? Surely it matters not in what way he asserted the law-whether as good, or as supererogatory,[fn-55-P5534_1701873:273-nf] or as patient, or as inconstant-provided, Marcion, I drive you from your position.[fn-55-P5535_1701976:274-nf] Observe,[fn-55-P5536_1701999:275-nf] he commanded that the law should be fulfilled. In whatever way he commanded it, in the same way might he also have first uttered that sentiment:[fn-55-P5537_1702157:276-nf] \"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-55-P5538_1702227:277-nf] What business, therefore, had you to erase out of the Gospel that which was quite consistent in it?[fn-55-P5539_1702347:278-nf] For you have confessed that, in his goodness, he did in act what you deny that he did in word.[fn-55-P5540_1702466:279-nf] We have therefore good proof that He uttered the word, in the fact that He did the deed; and that you have rather expunged the Lord's word, than that our (evangelists)[fn-55-P5541_1702823:280-nf] have inserted it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_27_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"4. Dost thou wish that we should exercise the argument in the case of Jesus Christ? What is equal to that salvation? what more profitable than that presence? But this very saving presence, so profitable, became an additional means of chastening to many. \"For for judgment\" saith he \"came I into this world, that they which see not may see, and that they which see may become blind.\"[fn-10-P1056_714815:11-nf] What dost thou say? The light became a cause of blindness? The light did not become a cause of blindness, but the weakness of the eyes of the soul was not able to entertain the light. Thou hast seen that a weak man is hurt on all sides, but the strong is benefited on all sides For in every case, the purpose is the cause, in every case the disposition is master. Since the Devil, if thou wouldest understand it, is even profitable to us, if we use him aright, and benefits us greatly, and we gain no ordinary advantages; and this, we shewed in a small degree from the case of Job. And it is possible also to learn this from Paul: for writing about the fornicator he thus speaks \"Deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved.\"[fn-10-P1057_715610:12-nf] Behold even the Devil has become a cause of salvation, but not because of his own disposition, but because of the skill of the Apostle. For as the physicians taking serpents and cutting off their destructive members, prepare medicines for antidotes; so also did Paul. He took whatever was profitable of the chastening that proceeds from the Devil, and left the rest alone; in order that thou mayest learn that the Devil is not the cause of salvation, but that he hasted to destroy and devour mankind. But that the Apostle through his own wisdom cut his throat: hear in the second epistle to the Corinthians, what he saith about this very fornicator, \"confirm your love towards him,\" \"lest by any means such an one should be swallowed up by over much sorrow.\" And, \"we be taken advantage of by Satan.\"[fn-10-P1058_716430:13-nf] We have snatched beforehand the man from the gullet of the wild beast, he saith. For the Apostle often used the Devil as an executioner. For the executioners punish those who have done wrong, not as they choose, but as the judges allow. For this is the rule for the executioner, to take vengeance, giving heed to the command of the judge. Dost thou see to what a dignity the Apostle mounted? He who was invested with a body, used the bodiless as an executioner; and that which their common master saith to the Devil, concerning Job: charging him thus, \"Touch his flesh, but thou shall not touch his life;\"[fn-10-P1059_717063:14-nf] giving him a limit, and measure of vengeance, in order that the wild beast might not be impetuous and leap upon him too shamelessly; this too the Apostle does.

Dost thou wish that we should exercise the argument in the case of Jesus Christ? What is equal to that salvation? what more profitable than that presence? But this very saving presence, so profitable, became an additional means of chastening to many. \"For for judgment\" saith he \"came I into this world, that they which see not may see, and that they which see may become blind.\"[fn-10-P1056_714815:11-nf] What dost thou say? The light became a cause of blindness? The light did not become a cause of blindness, but the weakness of the eyes of the soul was not able to entertain the light. Thou hast seen that a weak man is hurt on all sides, but the strong is benefited on all sides For in every case, the purpose is the cause, in every case the disposition is master. Since the Devil, if thou wouldest understand it, is even profitable to us, if we use him aright, and benefits us greatly, and we gain no ordinary advantages; and this, we shewed in a small degree from the case of Job. And it is possible also to learn this from Paul: for writing about the fornicator he thus speaks \"Deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved.\"[fn-10-P1057_715610:12-nf] Behold even the Devil has become a cause of salvation, but not because of his own disposition, but because of the skill of the Apostle. For as the physicians taking serpents and cutting off their destructive members, prepare medicines for antidotes; so also did Paul. He took whatever was profitable of the chastening that proceeds from the Devil, and left the rest alone; in order that thou mayest learn that the Devil is not the cause of salvation, but that he hasted to destroy and devour mankind. But that the Apostle through his own wisdom cut his throat: hear in the second epistle to the Corinthians, what he saith about this very fornicator, \"confirm your love towards him,\" \"lest by any means such an one should be swallowed up by over much sorrow.\" And, \"we be taken advantage of by Satan.\"[fn-10-P1058_716430:13-nf] We have snatched beforehand the man from the gullet of the wild beast, he saith. For the Apostle often used the Devil as an executioner. For the executioners punish those who have done wrong, not as they choose, but as the judges allow. For this is the rule for the executioner, to take vengeance, giving heed to the command of the judge. Dost thou see to what a dignity the Apostle mounted? He who was invested with a body, used the bodiless as an executioner; and that which their common master saith to the Devil, concerning Job: charging him thus, \"Touch his flesh, but thou shall not touch his life;\"[fn-10-P1059_717063:14-nf] giving him a limit, and measure of vengeance, in order that the wild beast might not be impetuous and leap upon him too shamelessly; this too the Apostle does. For delivering the fornicator over to him he says \"For the destruction of the flesh,\"[fn-10-P1060_717329:15-nf] that is \"thou shall not touch his life.\" Dost thou see the authority of the servant? Fear not therefore the Devil, even if he be bodiless: for he has come in contact with him.

(But) the seventh (day, which is) a rest and Sabbath, has been produced from the Hebdomad, which is over earth, and water, and fire, and air. And from these (elements) the world has been formed by the one tittle. For cubes, and octahedrons, and pyramids, and all figures similar to these, out of which consist fire, air, water, (and) earth, have arisen from numbers which are comprehended in that simple tittle of the iota. And this (tittle) constitutes a perfect son of a perfect man. When, therefore, he says, Moses mentions that the rod was changeably brandished for the (introduction of the) plagues throughout Egypt -now these plagues, he says, are allegorically expressed symbols of the creation -he did not (as a symbol) for more plagues than ten shape the rod. Now this (rod) constitutes one tittle of the iota, and is (both) twofold (and) various. This succession of ten plagues is, he says, the mundane creation. For all things, by being stricken, bring forth and bear fruit, just like vines. Man, he says, bursts forth, and is forcibly separated from man by being severed by a certain stroke. (And this takes place) in order that (man) may be generated, and may declare the law which Moses ordained, who received (it) from God. Conformably with that one tittle, the law constitutes the series of the ten commandments which expresses allegorically the divine mysteries of (those) precepts. For, he says, all knowledge of the universe is contained in what relates to the succession of the ten plagues and the series of the ten commandments. And no one is acquainted with this (knowledge) who is (of the number) of those that are deceived concerning the offspring of the woman. If, however, you say that the Pentateuch constitutes the entire law, it is from the Pentad which is comprehended in the one tittle. But the entire is for those who have not been altogether perfected in understanding a mystery, a new and not antiquated feast, legal, (and) everlasting, a passover of the Lord God kept unto our generations, by those who are able to discern (this mystery), at the commencement of the fourteenth day, which is the beginning of a decade from which, he says, they reckon. For the monad, as far as fourteen, is the summary of that one (tittle) of the perfect number. For one, two, three, four, become ten; and this is the one tittle. But from fourteen until one-and-twenty, he asserts that there is an Hebdomad which inheres in the one tittle of the world, and constitutes an unleavened creature in all these. For in what respect, he says, would the one tittle require any substance such as leaven (derived) from without for the Lord's Passover, the eternal feast, which is given for generation upon generation?[fn-20-P2090_652668:32-nf] For the entire world and all causes of creation constitute a passover, (i.e.,) a feast of the Lord. For God rejoices in the conversion of the creation, and this is accomplished by ten strokes of the one tittle. And this (tittle) is Moses' rod, which was given by God into the hand of Moses. And with this (rod Moses) smites the Egyptians, for the purpose of altering bodies,-as, for instance, water into blood; and the rest of (material) things similarly with these,-(as, for example,) the locusts, which is a symbol of grass. And by this he means the alteration of the elements into flesh; \"for all flesh,\" he says, \"is grass.\"[fn-20-P2091_653341:33-nf] These men, nevertheless receive even the entire law after some such manner; adopting very probably, as I think, the opinions of those of the Greeks who affirm that there are Substance, and Quality, and Quantity, and Relation, and Place, and Time, and Position, and Action, and Possession, and Passion.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_12_book_viii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And certain other (heretics), contentious by nature, (and) wholly uniformed as regards knowledge, as well as in their manner more (than usually) quarrelsome, combine (in maintaining) that Easter should be kept on the fourteenth day[fn-21-P2109_658839:39-nf] of the first month, according to the commandment of the law, on whatever day (of the week) it should occur.

The apostle declares that to himself, \"less than the least of all saints, was the grace given\" of enlightening all men as to \"what was the fellowship of the mystery, which during the ages had been hid in God, who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8009_2279216:811-nf] The heretic erased the preposition in, and made the clause run thus: (\"what is the fellowship of the mystery) which hath for ages been hidden from the God who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8010_2279419:812-nf] The falsification, however, is flagrantly[fn-80-P8011_2280020:813-nf] absurd. For the apostle goes on to infer (from his own statement): \"in order that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might become known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.\"[fn-80-P8012_2280238:814-nf] Whose principalities and powers does he mean? If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"10.

When you ask, again, why a Christian does not offer sacrifices to God of the flesh and blood of slain animals, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that it would be improper for a Christian to offer such sacrifices, now that what was thus prefigured has been fulfilled in Christ's offering of His own body and blood.

When, then, it was overcome by corruption, and delivered over to death through disobedience, God did not leave it to corruption. to be triumphed over as an inheritance; but, after conquering death by the resurrection, delivered it again to incorruption, in order that corruption might not receive the property of incorruption, but. incorruption that of corruption.

They ought not therefore to be turned to any other uses than those of the Church, and in behoof of Christian brethren before mentioned, and of the poor; for they are the offerings of the faithful, and they are redemption moneys for sins (pretia peccatorum), and the patrimony of the poor, and are given over to the Lord for the purpose already named. But if any one act otherwise (which may God forbid), let him take care lest he meet the condemnation of Ananias and Sapphira, and be found guilty of sacrilege, as those were who lied as to the price of the property designated, of whom we read thus in the before-cited passage of the Acts of the Apostles: \"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold land (agrum), and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. But Peter said to Ananias, Why hath Satan tempted (tentavit) thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whilst it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto the Lord. And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost. And great fear came on all them that heard these things. And the young men arose, and removed him (amoverunt), and carried him out, and buried him. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. And Peter answered unto her, and said, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost. And the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. And great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things.\"[fn-90-P9059_2940230:7-nf] These things, brethren, are carefully to be guarded against, and greatly to be feared. For the property of the Church, not being like personal, but like common property, and property offered to the Lord, is to be dispensed with the deepest fear, in the spirit of faithfulness, and for no other objects than the above-named, lest those should incur the guilt of sacrilege who divert it from the hands to which it was consigned, and lest they should come under the punishment and death of Ananias and Sapphira, and lest (which is yet worse) they should become anathema maranatha, and lest, though their body may not fall dead like that of Ananias and Sapphira, their soul, which is nobler than the body, should fall dead, and be cut off from the company of the faithful, and sink into the depths of the pit. Wherefore all must give heed to this matter, and watch in faithfulness, and avert the dishonour of such usurpation, lest possessions dedicated to the uses of things secret (or sacred) and heavenly be spoiled by any parties invading them. And if any one do so, then, after the sharp vengeance which is due to such a crime, and which is justly to be carried out against the sacrilegious, let him be condemned to perpetual infamy, and east into prison or consigned to life-long exile. For, according to the apostle,[fn-90-P9060_2941566:8-nf] we ought to deliver such a man to Satan, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.","title":"The Epistle of Pope Urban First","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"64. Doubtless, the intention of Faustus' calumnies is to damage this very assertion, that Christ was born of the tribe of Judah. Especially, as in the genealogy given by Matthew we find the name of Zara, whom this woman Tamar bore to Judah. Had Faustus wished to reproach Jacob's family merely, and not Christ's birth, he might have taken the case of Reuben the first-born, who committed the unnatural crime of defiling his father's bed, of which fornication the apostle says, that it was not so much as named among the Gentiles.[fn-21-P2190_1311914:108-nf] Jacob also mentions this in his blessing, charging his son with the infamous deed. Faustus might have brought up this, as Reuben seems to have been guilty of deliberate incest, and there was no harlot's disguise in this case, were it not that Tamar's conduct in desiring nothing but to have children is more odious to Faustus than if she had acted from criminal passion, and did he not wish to discredit the incarnation, by bringing reproach on Christ's progenitors. Faustus unhappily is not aware that the most true and truthful Saviour is a teacher, not only in His words, but also in His birth. In His fleshly origin there is this lesson for those who should believe on Him from all nations, that the sins of their fathers need be no hindrance to them. Besides, the Bridegroom, who was to call good and bad to His marriage,[fn-21-P2191_1312761:109-nf] was pleased to assimilate Himself to His guests, in being born of good and bad.

Let no one, then, be so daring as to make rash charges against men, not to say against God. If the service of the ministers of the Old Testament, who were also heralds of the New, consisted in putting sinners to death, and that of the ministers of the New Testament, who are also interpreters of the Old, in being put to death by sinners, the service in both cases is rendered to one God, who, varying the lesson to suit the times, teaches both that temporal blessings are to be sought from Him, and that they are to be forsaken for Him, and that temporal distress is both sent by Him and should be endured for Him. There was, therefore, no cruelty in the command, or in the action of Moses. when, in his holy jealousy for his people, whom he wished to be subject to the one true God, on learning that they had fallen away to the worship of an idol made by their own hands, he impressed their minds at the time with a wholesome fear, and gave them a warning for the future, by using the sword in the punishment of a few, whose just punishment God, against whom they had sinned, appointed in the depth of His secret judgment to be immediately inflicted. That Moses acted as he did, not in cruelty, but in great love, may be seen from the words in which he prayed for the sins of the people: \"If Thou wilt forgive their sin, forgive it; and if not, blot me out of Thy book.\"[fn-22-P2240_1350288:143-nf] The pious inquirer who compares the slaughter with the prayer will find in this the clearest evidence of the awful nature of the injury done to the soul by prostitution to the images of devils, since such love is roused to such anger. We see the same in the apostle, who, not in cruelty, but in love, delivered a man up to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.[fn-22-P2241_1350734:144-nf] Others, too, he delivered up, that they might learn not to blaspheme.[fn-22-P2242_1350824:145-nf] In the apocryphal books of the Manichaeans there is a collection of fables, published by some unknown authors under the name of the apostles. The books would no doubt have been sanctioned by the Church at the time of their publication, if holy and learned men then in life, and competent to determine the matter, had thought the contents to be true. One of the stories is, that the Apostle Thomas was once at a marriage feast in a country where he was unknown, when one of the servants struck him, and that he forthwith by his curse brought a terrible punishment on this man. For when he went out to the fountain to provide water for the guests, a lion fell on him and killed him, and the hand with which he had given a slight blow to the apostle was torn off, in fulfillment of the imprecation, and brought by a dog to the table at which the apostle was reclining. What could be more cruel than this? And yet, if I mistake not, the story goes on to say, that the apostle made up for the cruelty by obtaining for the man the blessing of pardon in the next world; so that, while the people of this strange country learned to fear the apostle as being so dear to God, the man's eternal welfare was secured in exchange for the loss of this mortal life. It matters not whether the story is true or false. At any rate, the Manichaeans, who regard as genuine and authentic books which the canon of the Church rejects, must allow, as shown in the story, that the virtue of patience, which the Lord enjoins when He says, \"If any one smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him thy left also,\" may be in the inward disposition, though it is not exhibited in bodily action or in words. For when the apostle was struck, instead of turning his other side to the man, or telling him to repeat the blow, he prayed to God to pardon his assailant in the next world, but not to leave the injury unpunished at the time. Inwardly he preserved a kindly feeling, while outwardly he wished the man to be punished as an example. As the Manichaeans believe this, rightly or wrongly, they may also believe that such was the intention of Moses, the servant of God, when he cut down with the sword the makers and worshippers of the idol; for his own words show that he so entreated for pardon for their sin of idolatry as to ask to be blotted out of God's book if his prayer was not heard. There is no comparison between a stranger being struck with the hand, and the dishonor done to God by forsaking Him for an idol, when He had brought the people out of the bondage of Egypt, had led them through the sea, and had covered with the waters the enemy pursuing them. Nor, as regards the punishment, is there any comparison between being killed with the sword and being torn in pieces by wild beasts. For judges in administering the law condemn to exposure to wild beasts worse criminals than are condemned to be put to death by the sword.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_29_the_book_concerning_the_mysteries_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"8.

Hence He says,[fn-63-P6369_1020519:165-nf] desiring to teach us that in accepting this state of servitude He had received a great gift from His Father: \"And My God shall be My strength. And He said to Me, It is a great thing for Thee to be called My servant.\" For if He had not become a servant, He would not have raised up the tribes of Jacob, nor have turned the heart of the diaspora of Israel, and neither would He have become a light of the Gentiles to be for salvation to the ends of the earth. And it is no great thing for Him to become a servant, even if it is called a great thing by His Father, for this is in comparison with His being called with an innocent sheep and with a lamb. For the Lamb of God became like an innocent sheep being led to the slaughter, that He may take away the sin of the world. He who supplies reason (logoj to all is made like a lamb which is dumb before her shearer, that we might be purified by His death, which is given as a sort of medicine against the opposing power, and also against the sin of those who open their minds to the truth. For the death of Christ reduced to impotence those powers which war against the human race, and it set free from sin by a power beyond our words the life of each believer. Since, then, He takes away sin until every enemy shall be destroyed and death last of all, in order that the whole world may be free from sin, therefore John points to Him and says:[fn-63-P6370_1021935:166-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" It is not said that He will take it away in the future, nor that He is at present taking it, nor that He has taken it, but is not taking it away now. His taking away sin is still going on, He is taking it away from every individual in the world, till sin be taken away from the whole world, and the Saviour deliver the kingdom prepared and completed to the Father, a kingdom in which no sin is left at all, and which, therefore, is ready to accept the Father as its king, and which on the other hand is waiting to receive all God has to bestow, fully, and in every part, at that time when the saying[fn-63-P6371_1022619:167-nf] is fulfilled, \"That God may be all in all.\" Further, we hear of a man who is said to be coming after John, who was made before him and was before him. This is to teach us that the man also of the Son of God, the man who was mixed with His divinity, was older than His birth from Mary. John says he does not know this man, but must he not have known Him when he leapt for joy when yet a babe unborn in Elisabeth's womb, as soon as the voice of Mary's salutation sounded in the ears of the wife of Zacharias? Consider, therefore, if the words \"I know Him not\" may have reference to the period before the bodily existence. Though he did not know Him before He assumed His body, yet he knew Him when yet in his mother's womb, and perhaps he is here learning something new about Him beyond what was known to him before, namely, that on whomsoever the Holy Spirit shall descend and abide on him, that is he who is to baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. He knew him from his mother's womb, but not all about Him. He did not know perhaps that this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire, when he saw the Spirit descending and abiding on Him. Yet that He was indeed a man, and the first man, John did not know.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Let no one think however that herein we depreciate marriage as an institution. We are well aware that it is not a stranger to God's blessing. But since the common instincts of mankind can plead sufficiently on its behalf, instincts which prompt by a spontaneous bias to take the high road of marriage for the procreation of children, whereas Virginity in a way thwarts this natural impulse, it is a superfluous task to compose formally an Exhortation to marriage. We put forward the pleasure of it instead, as a most doughty champion on its behalf. It may be however, notwithstanding this, that there is some need of such a treatise, occasioned by those who travesty the teaching of the Church. Such persons[fn-27-P2707_1849126:36-nf] \"have their conscience seared with a hot iron,\" as the Apostle expresses it; and very truly too, considering that, deserting the guidance of the Holy Spirit for the \"doctrines of devils,\" they have some ulcers and blisters stamped upon their hearts, abominating God's creatures, and calling them \"foul,\" \"seducing,\" \"mischievous,\" and so on. \"But what have I to do to judge them that are without[fn-27-P2708_1849541:37-nf] ?\" asks the Apostle. Truly those persons are outside the Court in which the words of our mysteries are spoken; they are not installed under God's roof, but in the monastery of the Evil One. They \"are taken captive by him at his will[fn-27-P2709_1849793:38-nf] .\" They therefore do not understand that all virtue is found in moderation, and that any declension to either side[fn-27-P2710_1849928:39-nf] of it becomes a vice. He, in fact, who grasps the middle point between doing too little and doing too much has hit the distinction between vice and virtue. Instances will make this clearer. Cowardice and audacity are two recognized vices opposed to each other; the one the defect, the other the excess of confidence; between them lies courage. Again, piety is neither atheism nor superstition; it is equally impious to deny a God and to believe in many gods. Is there need of more examples to bring this principle home? The man who avoids both meanness and prodigality will by this shunning of extremes form the moral habit of liberality; for liberality is the thing which is neither inclined to spend at random vast and useless sums, nor yet to be closely calculating in necessary expenses. We need not go into details in the case of all good qualities. Reason, in all of them, has established virtue to be a middle state between two extremes. Sobriety itself therefore is a middle state, and manifestly involves the two declensions on either side towards vice; he, that is, who is wanting in firmness of soul, and is so easily worsted in the combat with pleasure as never even to have approached the path of a virtuous and sober life, slides into shameful indulgence; while he who goes beyond the safe ground of sobriety and overshoots the moderation of this virtue, falls as it were from a precipice into the \"doctrines of devils,\" \"having his conscience seared with a hot iron.\" In declaring marriage abominable he brands himself with such reproaches; for \"if the tree is corrupt\" (as the Gospel says), \"the fruit also of the tree will be like it[fn-27-P2711_1851679:40-nf] \"; if a man is the shoot and fruitage of the tree of marriage, reproaches cast on that turn upon him who casts them[fn-27-P2712_1851937:41-nf] . These persons, then, are like branded criminals already; their conscience is covered with the stripes of this unnatural teaching. But our view of marriage is this; that, while the pursuit of heavenly things should be a man's first care, yet if he can use the advantages of marriage with sobriety and moderation, he need not despise this way of serving the state. An example might be found in the patriarch Isaac. He married Rebecca when he was past the flower of his age and his prime was well-nigh spent, so that his marriage was not the deed of passion, but because of God's blessing that should be upon his seed. He cohabited with her till the birth of her only children[fn-27-P2713_1852693:42-nf] , and then, closing the channels of the senses, lived wholly for the Unseen; for this is what seems to be meant by the mention in his history of the dimness of the Patriarch's eyes. But let that be as those think who are skilled in reading these meanings, and let us proceed with the continuity of our discourse. What then, were we saying? That in the cases where it is possible at once to be true to the diviner love, and to embrace wedlock, there is no reason for setting aside this dispensation of nature and misrepresenting as abominable that which is honourable. Let us take again our illustration of the water and the spring. Whenever the husbandman, in order to irrigate a particular spot, is bringing the stream thither, but there is need before it gets there of a small outlet, he will allow only so much to escape into that outlet as is adequate to supply the demand, and can then easily be blended again with the main stream. If, as an inexperienced and easy-going steward, he opens too wide a channel, there will be danger of the whole stream quitting its direct bed and pouring itself sideways. In the same way, if (as life does need a mutual succession) a man so treats this need as to give spiritual things the first thought, and because of the shortness[fn-27-P2714_1854143:43-nf] of the time indulges but sparingly the sexual passion and keeps it under restraint, that man would realize the character of the prudent husband man to which the Apostle exhorts us. About the details of paying these trifling debts of nature he will not be over-calculating, but the long hours of his prayers[fn-27-P2715_1854471:44-nf] will secure the purity which is the key-note of his life. He will always fear lest by this kind of indulgence he may become nothing but flesh and blood; for in them God's Spirit does not dwell. He who is of so weak a character that he cannot make a manful stand against nature's impulse had better[fn-27-P2716_1855070:45-nf] keep himself very far away from such temptations, rather than descend into a combat which is above his strength. There is no small danger for him lest, cajoled in the valuation of pleasure, he should think that there exists no other good but that which is enjoyed along with some sensual emotion, and, turning altogether from the love of immaterial delights, should become entirely of the flesh, seeking always his pleasure only there, so that his character will be a Pleasure-lover, not a God-lover. It is not every man's gift, owing to weakness of nature, to hit the due proportion in these matters; there is a danger of being carried far beyond it, and \"sticking fast in the deep mire[fn-27-P2717_1855821:46-nf] ,\" to use the Psalmist's words. It would therefore be for our interest, as our discourse has been suggesting, to pass through life without a trial of these temptations, lest under cover of the excuse of lawful indulgence passion should gain an entrance into the citadel of the soul.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_122_tractate_cxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. There is also another solution of this question, that we should not here understand the sixth hour of the day, because John says not, And it was about the sixth hour of the day, or about the sixth hour, but says, \"And it was the parasceve of the passover, about the sixth hour\" (ver. 14). And parasceve is in Latin praeparatio (preparation); but the Jews are fonder of using the Greek words in observances of this sort, even those of them who speak Latin rather than Greek. It was therefore the preparation of the passover. But \"our passover, Christ,\" as the apostle says, \"has been sacrificed;\"[fn-37-P3723_2055177:4-nf] and if we reckon the preparation of this passover from the ninth hour of the night (for then the chief priests seem to have given their verdict for the sacrifice of the Lord, when they said, \"He is guilty of death,\"[fn-37-P3724_2055409:5-nf] and when the hearing of His case was still proceeding in the high priest's house: whence there is a kind of harmony in understanding that therewith began the preparation of the true passover, whose shadow was the passover of the Jews, that is, of the sacrificing of Christ, when the priests gave their sentence that He was to be sacrificed), certainly from that hour of the night, which is conjectured to have been then the ninth, on to the third hour of the day, when the evangelist Mark testifies that Christ was crucified, there are six hours, three of the night, and three of the day. Hence in the case of this parasceve of the passover, that is, the preparation of the sacrifice of Christ, which began with the ninth hour of the night, it was about the sixth hour; that is to say, the fifth hour was completed, and the sixth had already begun to run, when Pilate ascended the tribunal: for that same preparation, which had begun with the ninth hour of the night, still continued till the sacrifice of Christ, which was the event in course of preparation, was completed, which took place at the third hour, according to Mark, not of the preparation, but of the day; while it was also the sixth hour, not of the day, but of the preparation, by reckoning, of course, six hours from the ninth hour of the night to the third of the day. Of these two solutions of this difficult question let each choose the one that pleases him. But one will judge better what to choose who reads the very elaborate discussions on \"The Harmony of the Evangelists.\"[fn-37-P3725_2056976:6-nf] And if other solutions of it can also be found, the stability of gospel truth will have a more cumulative defense against the calumnies of unbelieving and profane vanity.

And we might seasonably apply the saying to those who, along with the Christian way of life, prefer to live as the Jews, materially, for these do not see nor beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but, contrary to the will of Jesus who forbade it, eat the bread of the Pharisees.

And consider whether you cad in this connection say that the prophets who formerly suffered in virtue of their word having \"no form or beauty\" had an analogous position to the Word who had \"no form or beauty.\" And, as the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father, so the angels, who are the words in the prophets, are present with Him preserving the measure of their own glory.

Whence it follows that you ought to know what is being done in things sacred in the church of Rome, in order that, by following her example, ye may be found to be true children of her who is called your mother. Accordingly, as we have received the institution from our fathers, we maintain seven deacons in the city of Rome distributed over seven districts of the state, who attend to the services enjoined on them week by week, and on the Lord's days and the solemn festivals, in concert with the subdeacons, and acolytes, and servants of the succeeding orders, and hold themselves in readiness every hour for religious duty, and for the discharge of all that is enjoined upon them. In like manner ought ye also to do throughout your different cities, as may be convenient, that religious duty may be discharged zealously and regularly, without any delay or negligence. Furthermore, we have ordained in like manner seven subdeacons who shall stand by (imminerent) the seven notaries, and bring into one full and accurate account the histories of the martyrs, and lay them before us for our examination. And this, too, we urge you all to do, so that no doubt or questioning of these things may arise in later times; \"for whatsoever things were written, were written for our learning.\"[fn-91-P9195_2985560:1-nf] And whatsoever things are written in truth in our times, are directed to the learning of future times. And therefore we enjoin these duties to be put in charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be found in them, from which an offence (which may God forbid) may arise to the faithful. For this reason also we beg it of your love in paternal benignity, that the holy Church may now find the good-will of your love in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour whenever there is necessity. And as the goodness of your zeal affords us the assurance that we ought to distrust it in nothing, but rather commit these things in all confidence to you as to wise sons of our church; so, small importance being attached to opportune occasions, your virtue ought to exert itself the more strenuously in labours, and keep off reproaches by all possible means, and with all zeal. We exhort you also, according to the word of the apostle, to be \"stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not vain in the Lord.\"[fn-91-P9196_2986656:2-nf] And in another place: \"Watch ye, and pray, and stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men, and be strong. Let all things be done with charity.\"[fn-91-P9197_2986818:3-nf] Furthermore, we desire you to know this, that in our times, as our sins embarrassed us, and that ancient enemy who always goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,[fn-91-P9198_2987024:4-nf] instigated him, Novatus came up out of Africa, and separated Novatianus and certain other confessors of Christ from the Church of Christ, and persuaded them into the acceptance of evil doctrine. From such persons, brethren, keep yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a faith and doctrine different from that which the apostles and their successors have held and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going after him ye fall into the toils of Satan, and be bound with his fetters. Wherefore with most earnest prayers we beg it of your brotherly love, that ye may deem it fit to remember our insignificance in your holy prayers, beseeching and entreating the Lord of heaven that we, as well as our holy mother the Church of Christ, redeemed with His precious blood, may be delivered from the toils of Satan, who lieth in wait for us; and from troublesome and wicked men, and that the Word of God may have free course and be glorified, and that the evil doctrine of them, and of all who teach things contrary to the truth, may be overthrown and perish. We beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious supplications, that our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all men to be saved, and no one to perish,[fn-91-P9199_2988263:5-nf] may, by His vast omnipotence, cause their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the Catholic faith, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the devil who are held captive by him, and be united with the children of our mother the Church. Be mindful also of your brethren, and have pity upon them, and labour for them by all means in your power, that they be not lost, but be saved unto the Lord by your prayers, and other efforts of your goodness. So act therefore in these matters that ye may approve yourselves as obedient and faithful children of the holy Church of God, and that ye may obtain the recompense of reward. These men, and all else who do not teach the true doctrine, and hold not the true faith, cannot act as accusers of any true believer, because they are branded with infamy, and are cut off from the bosom of our holy mother the Church by the sword of the apostles, until their return to correct conversation and belief. Hence by apostolic authority, and in agreement with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal Church, we resolve that all who come under suspicion with respect to the Catholic faith cannot be admitted as accusers of those who hold the true creed; for suspicions are always to be set aside. Rightly therefore are charges which are preferred by those who are objects of suspicion in the matter of the true faith, rejected. Neither are they at all to be credited who are unacquainted with the faith of the Trinity. In like manner we set aside and withdraw from all part in the accusing of the faithful, all those whom the decrees of the holy fathers in times past and times future alike anathematize. Accordingly, the believing ought always to be kept distinct from the unbelieving, and the righteous from the unrighteous; since the unbelieving and evil-minded, by every means in their power, are always troubling the believing, and striving to undo them; and consequently they are not to be received, but rejected and kept entirely at a distance, lest they may undo or defame the believing. For this reason, dearly beloved, beware of the pit of such persons, into which we know many have fallen. Beware of the snares (or darts) of such persons, and of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by which we have seen even those closely connected with us fall wounded before us. Watch the nooses of the liers in wait, by which they are wont to strangle associates and comrades. Follow not such, but keep them far off from you. Be ye, according to the voice of Truth, wise as serpents and harmless as doves.[fn-92-P9200_2990844:6-nf] See to it that ye neither run nor labour in vain; but, sustained by each other's prayers and supplications, strive ye to do the will of God; and from those persons whom I have mentioned, if they show themselves incorrigible, keep yourselves separate in all things. In like manner keep yourselves separate from all those of whom the apostle makes mention when he says, \"with such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9201_2991266:7-nf] since these latter, as well as the former, are to be rejected, and are not to be admitted before they have given satisfaction to the Church. For those with whom it is not lawful to eat are manifestly separated from all intercourse with the rest of the brethren until such satisfaction is given. Wherefore they ought not and cannot be admitted to the preferring of charges against the faithful, but they ought to be debarred from their society until the satisfaction already mentioned is given, lest these too should be made like them, or underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have the apostles decreed, saying, With the excommunicated no fellowship is to be held. And if any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings with the excommunicated in his house, or speaks or prays in company with them, that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion. Such persons, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are not to be received, because, according to the apostle, not only those who commit such things are condemned, but also those who consent with those who do them.[fn-92-P9202_2992387:8-nf] Whence also the blessed chief of the apostles, Peter, addressing the people at the ordination of Clement, says this among other things:[fn-92-P9203_2992538:9-nf] If this Clement is hostile to any one on account of his deeds, wait not ye for his saying directly to you, Be not on terms of friendship with this man. But mark ye carefully his will as ye ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and separate yourselves from that man to whom ye perceive him to be inimical, and speak not with those with whom he speaks not, in order that every one who may be in fault, as he desires to possess the friendship of all of you, may be zealous in effecting a reconciliation all the more quickly with him who presides over all, so that be may return to spiritual well-being (redeat et salutem) hereby, when he begins to yield obedience to the charges of the president.","title":"The First Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":5,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_131_the_second_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Accordingly we have set these matters before you, in order that those who now know it not may know this; viz., that the priests, too, whom the Lord has taken to Himself from among all men, and has willed to be His own, are not to be dealt with lightly, nor injured, nor rashly accused or reprehended, save by their masters, seeing that the Lord has chosen to reserve their causes to Himself, and ministers vengeance according to His own judgment. For in these and other precepts of the Lord the faithful are distinguished, and the unfaithful at the same time disapproved. For these are rather to be borne with by the faithful than made subjects of reproach (exprobrandi); just as there is chaff with the wheat even to the last winnowing, and as there are bad fish with good even on to their separation, which is yet to be on the shore,-that is to say, at the end of the world. By no means, then, can that man be condemned by a human examination, whom God has reserved for His own judgment, that the purpose of God, according to which He has decreed to save what had perished, may be unalterable. And consequently, as His will suffers no change, let no man presume on matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of that word which the apostle speaks: \"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? \"[fn-92-P9240_3009696:13-nf] To this, too, our Lord's word may refer: \"And if any man will take away thy coat, and sue thee at the law, let him have thy cloak also.\"[fn-92-P9241_3009852:14-nf] And in another place: \"Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.\"[fn-92-P9242_3009949:15-nf] Moreover, there are certain things which might be thought most trivial were they not shown in the Scriptures to be of more serious import. Who would ever consider the man who says to his brother \"Thou fool\" worthy of hell-fire, were it not that the Truth Himself told us so?[fn-92-P9243_3010242:16-nf] Those, furthermore, who commit those sins whereof the apostle says, \"They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-92-P9244_3010392:17-nf] are by all means to be guarded against, and are to be compelled to seek amendment if they do not choose it voluntarily, because they are marked with the stains of infamy, and go down into the pit, unless assistance is brought them by sacerdotal authority. Those also are to be dealt with in like manner of whom he says, \"With such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9245_3010767:18-nf] because such persons are branded with infamy until they are restored by sacerdotal authority, and reinstated in the bosom of our holy mother the Church; since those who are outside us cannot communicate with us. And it is manifest that these are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not lawful for us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all persons who underlie the charge of any manner of turpitude and dishonour, are rendered infamous; and all who arm themselves against fathers are rendered infamous. \"Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious.\"[fn-92-P9246_3011440:19-nf] \"He that wanteth understanding thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and erring man imagineth follies.\"[fn-92-P9247_3011568:20-nf] For their suspicion has overthrown many, and their opinion hath held them in vanity. \"A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. A heart that entereth two ways shall not have rest; and the evil heart in them shall be made to stumble. A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the sinner shall heap sin upon sin.\"[fn-92-P9248_3011960:21-nf] The holy apostles and their successors, having such things in mind, and foreseeing, as being filled with the Holy Spirit, the course of wicked men, and having regard to the simple, determined that the accusing of priests should be a matter undertaken with difficulty, or never undertaken, that they might not be ruined or displaced by wicked men. For if this were made an easy matter to secular and wicked men, there would remain no one, or but the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has been and still is the case-and (which is yet worse) that too in growing measure-that the wicked persecute the good, and that the carnal are hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has been already said, they decreed that such should not be accused at all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such should be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has been stated above, by what persons that function should not be assumed; and they resolved further, that bishops should not be cast out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way the matter of accusation should be taken in hand before their rightful seat and all their property are restored by those laws, they should by no means be accused or criminated by any one, and should not answer any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of their own accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted, and have had all their effects restored to them by those laws, when their affairs are arranged and set in order, they should then have a long period allowed them for the disposing of their case; and thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come to the suit; and if the matter seem just, they should answer the propositions of their accusers with the help of their brethren. For so long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that any charge ought to be preferred against them. And no one is at liberty by any means to bring any charge against them, whether superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their churches, effects, or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and we too confirm the same statutes and hereby decree, that if any one among the clergy proves an enemy or traducer of his bishops, and seeks to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the consideration of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the clerical order, and given over to the court (curioe), to which he shall devote himself zealously all the days of his life, and shall remain infamous without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume to be at once accuser, and judge, or witness; for in every judicial investigation there must always be four persons present: that is, the judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and the witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority, that the flock should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor, to whose care they had been consigned, unless he falls into error in the faith; for the deeds of superiors are not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth; neither can the disciple be above the master, as the voice of Truth saith, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.\"[fn-92-P9249_3015358:22-nf] ","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"146","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But since the human being is a twofold creature, compounded of soul and body, it is necessary that the saved should lay hold of[fn-40-P4047_2684900:102-nf] the Author of the new life through both their component parts. Accordingly, the soul being fused into Him through faith derives from that the means and occasion of salvation; for the act of union with the life implies a fellowship with the life. But the body comes into fellowship and blending with the Author of our salvation in another way. For as they who owing to some act of treachery have taken poison, allay its deadly influence by means of some other drug (for it is necessary that the antidote should enter the human vitals in the same way as the deadly poison, in order to secure, through them, that the effect of the remedy may be distributed through the entire system), in like manner we, who have tasted the solvent of our nature[fn-40-P4048_2685745:103-nf] , necessarily need something that may combine what has been so dissolved, so that such an antidote entering within us may, by its own counter-influence, undo the mischief introduced into the body by the poison. What, then, is this remedy to be? Nothing else than that very Body which has been shown to be superior to death, and has been the First-fruits of our life. For, in the manner that, as the Apostle says[fn-40-P4049_2686476:104-nf] , a little leaven assimilates to itself the whole lump, so in like manner that body to which immortality has been given it by God, when it is in ours, translates and transmutes the whole into itself. For as by the admixture of a poisonous liquid with a wholesome one the whole drought is deprived of its deadly effect, so too the immortal Body, by being within that which receives it, changes the whole to its own nature. Yet in no other way can anything enter within the body but by being transfused through the vitals by eating and drinking. It is, therefore, incumbent on the body to admit this life-producing power in the one way that its constitution makes possible. And since that Body only which was the receptacle of the Deity received this grace of immortality, and since it has been shown that in no other way was it possible for our body to become immortal, but by participating in incorruption through its fellowship with that immortal Body, it will be necessary to consider how it was possible that that one Body, being for ever portioned to so many myriads of the faithful throughout the whole world, enters through that portion, whole into each individual, and yet remains whole in itself. In order, therefore, that our faith, with eyes fixed on logical probability, may harbour no doubt on the subject before us, it is fitting to make a slight digression in our argument, to consider the physiology of the body. Who is there that does not know that our bodily frame, taken by itself, possesses no life in its own proper subsistence, but that it is by the influx of a force or power from without that it holds itself together and continues in existence, and by a ceaseless motion that it draws to itself what it wants, and repels what is superfluous? When a leathern bottle is full of some liquid, and then the contents leak out at the bottom, it would not retain the contour of its full bulk unless there entered? at the top something else to fill up the vacuum; and thus a person, seeing the circumference of this bottle swollen to its full size, would know that this circumference did not really belong to the object which he sees, but that what was being poured in, by being in it, gave shape and roundness to the bulk. In the same way the mere framework of our body possesses nothing belonging to itself that is cognizable by us, to hold it together, but remains in existence owing to a force that is introduced into it. Now this power or force both is, and is called, nourishment. But it is not the same in all bodies that require aliment, but to each of them has been assigned a food adapted to its condition by Him who governs Nature. Some animals feed on roots which they dig up. Of others grass is the food, of others different kinds of flesh, but for man above all things bread; and, in order to continue and preserve the moisture of his body, drink, not simply water, but water frequently sweetened with wine, to join forces with our internal heat. He, therefore, who thinks of these things, thinks by implication[fn-40-P4050_2689538:105-nf] of the particular bulk of our body. For those things by being within me became my blood and flesh, the corresponding nutriment by its power of adaptation being changed into the form of my body. With these distinctions we must return to the consideration of the question before us. The question was, how can that one Body of Christ vivify the whole of mankind, all, that is, in whomsoever there is Faith, and yet, though divided amongst all, be itself not diminished? Perhaps, then, we are now not far from the probable explanation. If the subsistence of every body depends on nourishment, and this is eating and drinking, and in the case of our eating there is bread and in the case of our drinking water sweetened with wine, and if, as was explained at the beginning, the Word of God, Who is both God and the Word, coalesced with man's nature, and when He came in a body such as ours did not innovate on man's physical constitution so as to make it other than it was, but secured continuance for His own body by the customary and proper means, and controlled its subsistence by meat and drink, the former of which was bread,-just, then, as in the case of ourselves, as has been repeatedly said already, if a person sees bread he also, in a kind of way, looks on a human body, for by the bread being within it the bread becomes it, so also, in that other case, the body into which God entered, by partaking of the nourishment of bread, was, in a certain measure, the same with it; that nourishment, as we have said, changing itself into the nature of the body. For that which is peculiar to all flesh is acknowledged also in the case of that flesh, namely, that that Body too was maintained by bread; which Body also by the indwelling of God the Word was transmuted to the dignity of Godhead. Rightly, then, do we believe that now also the bread which is consecrated by the Word of God is changed into the Body of God the Word. For that Body was once, by implication, bread, but has been consecrated by the inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled in the flesh. Therefore, from the same cause as that by which the bread that was transformed in that Body was changed to a Divine potency, a similar result takes place now. For as in that case, too, the grace of the Word used to make holy the Body, the substance of which came of the bread, and in a manner was itself bread, so also in this case the bread, as says the Apostle[fn-40-P4051_2691980:106-nf] , \"is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer\"; not that it advances by the process of eating[fn-40-P4052_2692096:107-nf] to the stage of passing into the body of the Word, but it is at once changed into the body by means of the Word, as the Word itself said, \"This is My Body.\" Seeing, too, that all flesh is nourished by what is moist (for without this combination our earthly part would not continue to live), just as we support by food which is firm and solid the solid part of our body, in like manner we supplement the moist part from the kindred element; and this, when within us, by its faculty of being transmitted, is changed to blood, and especially if through the wine it receives the faculty of being transmuted into heat. Since, then, that God-containing flesh partook for its substance and support of this particular nourishment also, and since the God who was manifested infused Himself into perishable humanity for this purpose, viz. that by this communion with Deity mankind might at the same time be deified, for this end it is that, by dispensation of His grace, He disseminates Himself in every believer through that flesh, whose substance comes from bread and wine, blending Himself with the bodies of believers, to secure that, by this union with the immortal, man, too, may be a sharer in incorruption. He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through which He transelements[fn-40-P4053_2695586:108-nf] the natural quality of these visible things to that immortal thing.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_29_sermon_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"11.

And he who gives thanks does not occupy his time in pleasures. And if we would persuade any of our fellow-guests to virtue, we are all the more on this account to abstain from those dainty dishes; and so exhibit ourselves as a bright pattern of virtue, such as we ourselves have in Christ. \"For if any of such meats make a brother to stumble, I shall not eat it as long as the world lasts,\" says he, \"that I may not make my brother stumble.\"[fn-37-P3744_1135670:28-nf] I gain the man by a little self-restraint. \"Have we not power to eat and to drink? \"[fn-37-P3745_1135777:29-nf] And \"we know\"-he says the truth-\"that an idol is nothing in the world; but we have only one true God, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus.

For this is rather characteristic of a beast; and the fumes arising from them being dense, darken the soul. If one partakes of them, he does not sin.

For a voice will whisper to him, saying, \"Destroy not the work of God for the sake of food.\"[fn-37-P3749_1136961:33-nf] For it is the mark of a silly mind to be amazed and stupefied at what is presented at vulgar banquets, after the rich fare which is in the Word; and much sillier to make one's eyes the slaves of the delicacies, so that one's greed is, so to speak, carried round by the servants. And how foolish for people to raise themselves on the couches, all but pitching their faces into the dishes, stretching out from the couch as from a nest, according to the common saying, \"that they may catch the wandering steam by breathing it in!\" And how senseless, to besmear their hands with the condiments, and to be constantly reaching to the sauce, cramming themselves immoderately and shamelessly, not like people tasting, but ravenously seizing! For you may see such people, liker swine or dogs for gluttony than men, in such a hurry to feed themselves full, that both jaws are stuffed out at once, the veins about the face raised, and besides, the perspiration running all over, as they are tightened with their insatiable greed, and panting with their excess; the food pushed with unsocial eagerness into their stomach, as if they were stowing away their victuals for provision for a journey, not for digestion. Excess, which in all things is an evil, is very highly reprehensible in the matter of food. Gluttony, called o0yofagi/a, is nothing but excess in the use of relishes (o !yon); and laimargi/a is insanity with respect to the gullet; and gastrimargi/a is excess with respect to food-insanity in reference to the belly, as the name implies; for ma/rgoj is a madman. The apostle, checking those that transgress in their conduct at entertainments,[fn-37-P3750_1138624:34-nf] says: \"For every one taketh beforehand in eating his own supper; and one is hungry, and another drunken.

And of the same thing a very clear and plain proof has been given in our own days in the case of the Abbots Paul and Moses who lived in a spot in this desert called Calamus,[fn-45-P4555_1663436:57-nf] for the former had formerly dwelt in the wilderness which is hard by the city of Panephysis,[fn-45-P4556_1663554:58-nf] which we know had only recently been made a wilderness by an inundation of salt water; which whenever the north wind blew, was driven from the marshes and spreading over the adjacent fields covered the face of the whole district, so as to make the ancient villages, which on this very account had been deserted by all their inhabitants, look like islands. Here, then, the Abbot Paul had made such progress in purity of heart in the stillness and silence of the desert, that he did not suffer, I will not say a woman's face, but even the clothes of one of that sex to appear in his sight. For when as he was going to the cell of one of the Elders together with Abbot Archebius[fn-45-P4557_1664248:59-nf] who lived in the same desert, by accident a woman met him, he was so disgusted at meeting her that he dropped the business of his friendly visit which he had taken in hand and dashed back again to his own monastery with greater speed than a man would flee from the face of a lion or terrible dragon; so that he was not moved even by the shouts and prayers of the aforesaid Abbot Archebius who called him back to go on with the journey they had undertaken to ask the old man what they had proposed to do. But though this was done in his eagerness for chastity and desire for purity, yet because it was done not according to knowledge, and because the observance of discipline, and the methods of proper strictness were overstrained, for he imagined that not merely familiarity with a woman (which is the real harm,) but even the very form of that sex was to be execrated, he was forthwith overtaken by such a punishment that his whole body was struck with paralysis, and none of his limbs were able to perform their proper functions, since not merely his hands and feet, but even the movements of the tongue, which enables us to frame our words, (were affected) and his very ears lost the sense of hearing, so that there was left in him nothing more of his manhood than an immovable and insensible figure. But he was reduced to such a condition that the utmost care of men was unable to minister to his infirmity, but only the tender service of women could attend to his wants: for when he was taken to a convent of holy virgins, food and drink, which he could not ask for even by signs, were brought to him by female attendants, and for the performance of all that nature required he was ministered to by the same service for nearly four years, i.e., to the end of his life. And though he was affected by such weakness of all his members that none of his limbs retained their keen power of motion and feeling, nevertheless such grace of goodness proceeded from him that when sick persons were anointed with the oil which had touched what should be called his corpse rather than his body, they were instantly healed of all diseases, so that as regards his own malady it was made clearly and plainly evident even to unbelievers that the infirmity of all his limbs was caused by the providence and love of the Lord, and that the grace of these healings was granted by the power of the Holy Ghost as a witness of his purity and a manifestation of his merits.","title":"VII.

And this will be by your abounding in hope. Now this is the cause of all good things, and it comes from the Holy Ghost. But it is not simply from the Spirit, but on condition of our contributing our part also. This is why he says, \"in believing.\" For this is the way for you to be filled with joy, if ye believe, if ye hope. Yet he does not say if ye hope, but, \"if ye abound in hope,\" so as not to find comfort in troubles only, but even to have joy through the abundance of faith and hope. And in this way, ye will also draw the Spirit to you. In this way, when He is come ye will continually keep to all good things. For just as food maintaineth our life, and by this ruleth the body,[fn-32-P3272_3030110:4-nf] so if we have good works, we shall have the Spirit; and if we have the Spirit, we shall also have good works. As also, on the other hand, if we have no works, the Spirit flieth away. But if we be deserted by the Spirit, we shall also halt in our works. For when this hath gone, the unclean one cometh: this is plain from Saul. For what if he doth not choke[fn-32-P3273_3030555:5-nf] us as he did him, still he strangles us in some other way by wicked works. We have need then of the harp of David, that we may charm our souls with the divine songs, both these, and those from good actions. Since if we do the one only, and while we listen to the charm, war with the charmer by our actions, as he did of old (1 Sam. xix. 10); the remedy will even turn to judgment to us, and the madness become the more furious. For before we heard, the wicked demon was afraid lest we should hear it and recover. But when after hearing it even, we continue the same as we were, this is the very thing to rid him of his fear. Let us sing then the Psalm of good deeds, that we may cast out the sin that is worse than the demon. For a demon certainly will not deprive us of heaven, but doth in some cases[fn-32-P3274_3031427:6-nf] even work with the sober-minded. But sin will assuredly cast us out. For this is a demon we willingly receive, a self-chosen madness. Wherefore also it hath none to pity it or to pardon it. Let us then sing charms over a soul in this plight, as well from the other Scriptures, as also from the blessed David. And let the mouth sing, and the mind be instructed. Even this is no small thing. For if we once teach the tongue to sing, the soul will be ashamed to be devising the opposite of what this singeth. Nor is this the only good thing that we shall gain, for we shall also come to know many things which are our interest. For he discourseth to thee both of things present, and things to come, and of things seen, and of the invisible Creation. And if thou wouldest learn about the Heaven, whether it abideth as it is or shall be changed, he gives thee a clear answer, and will say, \"The heavens shall way old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shall thou fold them up, O God, and they shall be changed.\" (Ps. cii. 26.) And if thou wishest to hear of the form of them again, thou shall hear, \"That spreadeth forth the Heaven like a curtain\" (derrin). And if thou be minded to know further about the back of them, he will tell thee again, \"that covereth His upper chambers with waters.\" (Ps. civ. 2, 3.) And even here he does not pause, but will likewise discourse with thee on the breadth and height, and show thee that these are of equal measure. For, \"As far as the east,\" he says, \"is from the west, so far hath He set our iniquities from us. Like as the heaven's height above the earth, so is the Lord's mercy upon them that fear Him.\" (ib. ciii. 12, 11.) But if thou wouldest busy thyself with the foundation of the earth, even this he will not hide from thee, but thou shall hear him singing and saying, \"He hath founded it upon the seas.\" (ib. xxiv. 2.) And if of earthquakes thou art desirous to know, whence they come, he will free thee from this difficulty also, by saying, \"That looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble.\" (ib. civ. 32.) And if thou enquire the use of the night, this too mayest thou learn, and know from him. For \"therein all the beasts of the forest do move.\" (ib. 20.) And in what way the mountains are for use, he will tell thee, \"The high mountains are for the stags.\" And why there are rocks, \"The rocks are a refuge for the porcupines.\" (ib. 18.) Why are there trees yielding no fruit? learn from him, for \"there the sparrows build their nests.\" (ib. 17.) Why are there fountains in the wildernesses? hear, \"that by them the fowls of the heaven dwell, and the wild beasts.\" (ib. 12.) Why is there wine? not that thou mayest drink only (for water is of a nature to suffice for this), but that thou mayest be gladdened also, \"For wine maketh glad the heart of man.\" (ib. 15.) And by knowing this you will know how far the use of wine is allowable. Whence are the fowls and the wild beasts nourished? thou wilt hear from his words, \"All these wait upon Thee, to give them their meat in due season.\" (ib. 27.) If thou sayest, For what purpose are the cattle? he will answer thee, that these also are for thee, \"That causeth the grass,\" he says, \"to grow for the cattle, and the green herb for the service (or retinue)of men.\" (ib. 14.) What is the use of the moon? hear him saying, \"He made the moon for seasons.\" (Ps. civ. 19.) And that all things seen and those not seen are made, is a thing that he has also clearly taught us by saying, \"Himself spake, and they were made, He commanded, and they were created.\" (ib. xxxiii. 9.) And that there is an end of death, this he also teaches when he says, \"God shall deliver my soul from the hand of hell when He shall receive me.\" (ib. xlix. 15.) Whence was our body made? he also tells us; \"He remembereth that we are dust\" (ib. ciii. 14); and again, whither goeth it away? \"It shall return to its dust.\" (ib. civ. 29.) Why was this universe made? For thee: \"For thou crownest him with glory and honor, and settest him over the works of Thy hands.\" (ib. viii. 5, 6.) Have we men any community with the Angels? This he also tells us, saying as follows, \"Thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels.\" Of the love of God, \"Like as a father pitieth his own children, even so is the Lord merciful to them that fear Him.\" (ib. ciii. 13.) And of the things that are to meet us after our present life, and of that undisturbed condition, he teacheth, \"Return unto thy rest, O my soul.\" (ib. cxvi. 7.) Why the Heaven is so great, this he will also say. For it is because \"the heavens declare the glory of God.\" (ib. xix. 1.) Why day and night were made,-not that they may shine and give us rest only, but also that they may instruct us. \"For there are no speeches nor words, the sounds of which (i.e. day and night) are not heard.\" (ib. 3.)

So we are not remiss in giving notice of its seasons, as we have received from the Fathers. Again we write, again keeping to the apostolic traditions, we remind each other when we come together for prayer; and keeping the feast in common, with one mouth we truly give thanks to the Lord. Thus giving thanks unto Him, and being followers of the saints, `we shall make our praise in the Lord all the day[fn-89-P8906_3266315:43-nf] ,' as the Psalmist says. So, when we rightly keep the feast, we shall be counted worthy of that joy which is in heaven.","title":"Letter II.

For although we have been held under restraint by those who afflict us, that, because of them, we should not announce to you this season; yet thanks be to `God, who comforteth the afflicted[fn-89-P8918_3268134:1-nf] ,' that we have not been overcome by the wickedness of our accusers and silenced; but obeying the voice of truth, we together with you cry aloud in the day of the feast. For the God of all hath commanded, saying, `Speak[fn-89-P8919_3268525:2-nf] , and the children of Israel shall keep the Passover.' And the Spirit exhorts in the Psalm; `Blow the trumpet in the new moons[fn-89-P8920_3268690:3-nf] , in the solemn day of your feast.' And the prophet cries; `Keep thy feasts, O Judah[fn-89-P8921_3268829:4-nf] .' I do not send word to you as though you were ignorant; but I publish it to those who know it, that ye may perceive that although men have separated us, yet God having made us companions, we approach the same feast, and worship the same Lord continually. And we do not keep the festival as observers of days, knowing that the Apostle reproves those who do so, in those words which he spake; `Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years[fn-89-P8922_3269315:5-nf] .' But rather do we consider the day solemn because of the feast; so that all of us, who serve God in every place, may together in our prayers be well-pleasing to God. For the blessed Paul, announcing the nearness of gladness like this, did not announce days, but the Lord, for whose sake we keep the feast, saying, `Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed[fn-89-P8923_3269684:6-nf] ;' so that we all, contemplating the eternity of the Word, may draw near to do Him service.","title":"Letter III.

But the faithful and true servants of the Lord, knowing that the Lord loves the thankful, never cease to praise Him, ever giving thanks unto the Lord. And whether the time is one of ease or of affliction, they offer up praise to God with thanksgiving, not reckoning these things of time, but worshipping the Lord, the God of times[fn-89-P8954_3278251:33-nf] . Thus of old time, Job, who possessed fortitude above all men, thought of these things when in prosperity; and when in adversity, he patiently endured, and when he suffered, gave thanks. As also the humble David, in the very time of affliction sang praises and said, `I will bless the Lord at all times[fn-89-P8955_3278586:34-nf] .' And the blessed Paul, in all his Epistles, so to say, ceased not to thank God. In times of ease, he failed not, and in afflictions he gloried, knowing that `tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and that hope maketh not ashamed[fn-89-P8956_3278874:35-nf] .' Let us, being followers of such men, pass no season without thanksgiving, but especially now, when the time is one of tribulation, which the heretics excite against us, will we praise the Lord, uttering the words of the saints; `All these things have come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee[fn-89-P8957_3279190:36-nf] .' For as the Jews at that time, although suffering an assault from the tabernacles[fn-89-P8958_3279293:37-nf] of the Edomites, and oppressed by the enemies of Jerusalem, did not give themselves up, but all the more sang praises to God; so we, my beloved brethren, though hindered from speaking the word of the Lord, will the more proclaim it, and being afflicted, we will sing Psalms[fn-89-P8959_3279596:38-nf] , in that we are accounted worthy to be despised, and to labour anxiously for the truth. Yea, moreover, being grievously vexed, we will give thanks. For the blessed Apostle, who gave thanks at all times, urges us in the same manner to draw near to God saying, `Let your requests, with thanksgiving, be made known unto God[fn-89-P8960_3279940:39-nf] .' And being desirous that we should always continue in this resolution, he says, `At all times give thanks; pray without ceasing[fn-89-P8961_3280088:40-nf] .' For he knew that believers are strong while employed in thanksgiving, and that rejoicing they pass over the walls of the enemy, like those saints who said, `Through Thee will we pierce through our enemies, and by my God I will leap over a walls[fn-89-P8962_3280357:41-nf] .' At all times let us stand firm, but especially now, although many afflictions overtake us, and many heretics are furious against us. Let us then, my beloved brethren, celebrate with thanksgiving the holy feast which now draws near to us, `girding up the loins of our minds[fn-89-P8963_3280652:42-nf] ,' like our Saviour Jesus Christ, of Whom it is written, `Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins[fn-89-P8964_3280818:43-nf] .' Each one of us having in his hand the staff which came out of the root of Jesse, and our feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel[fn-89-P8965_3280971:44-nf] , let us keep the feast as Paul saith, `Not with the old leaven, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth[fn-89-P8966_3281118:45-nf] ;' reverently trusting that we are reconciled through Christ, and not departing from faith in Him, nor do we defile ourselves together with heretics, and strangers to the truth, whose conversation and whose will degrade them. But rejoicing in afflictions, we break through the furnace of iron and darkness, and pass, unharmed, over that terrible Red Sea. Thus also, when we look upon the confusion of heretics, we shall, with Moses, sing that great song of praise, and say, `We will sing unto the Lord, for He is to be gloriously praised[fn-89-P8967_3281674:46-nf] .' Thus, singing praises, and seeing that the sin which is in us has been cast into the sea, we pass over to the wilderness. And being first purified by the fast of forty days, by prayers, and fastings, and discipline, and good works, we shall be able to eat the holy Passover in Jerusalem.","title":"Letter III.

If then God Himself loves the feast, and calls us to it, it is not right, my brethren, that it should be delayed, or observed carelessly; but with alacrity and zeal we should come to it, so that having begun joyfully here, we may also receive an earnest of that heavenly feast. For if we diligently celebrate the feast here, we shall doubtless receive the perfect joy which is in heaven, as the Lord says; `With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I say unto you, that I will not eat it, until it is fulfilled with you in the kingdom of God[fn-90-P9057_3306265:5-nf] .'

For the Lord died in those days, that we should no longer do the deeds of death. He gave His life, that we might preserve our own from the snares of the devil. And, what is most wonderful, the Word became flesh, that we should no longer live in the flesh, but in spirit should worship God, who is Spirit. He who is not so disposed, abuses the days, and does not keep the feast, but like an unthankful person finds fault with the grace, and honours the days overmuch, while he does not supplicate the Lord who in those days redeemed him. Let him by all means hear, though fancying that he keeps the feast, the Apostolic voice reproving him; `Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years: I fear test I have laboured among you in vain[fn-90-P9059_3307358:7-nf] .'","title":"Letter VI.

To the Jews, when they thought they were keeping the Passover, because they persecuted the Lord, the feast was useless; since it no longer bore the name of the Lord, even according to their own testimony.

These, having become dead to the world, and renounced the merchandise of the world, gain an honourable death; for, `precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints[fn-91-P9150_3330483:19-nf] .' They are also able, preserving the Apostolic likeness, to say, `I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me[fn-91-P9151_3330653:20-nf] .' For that is the true life, which a man lives in Christ; for although they are dead to the world, yet they dwell as it were in heaven, minding those things which are above, as he who was a lover of such a habitation said, `While we walk on earth, our dwelling is in heaven[fn-91-P9152_3330946:21-nf] .' Now those who thus live, and are partakers in such virtue, are alone able to give glory to God, and this it is which essentially constitutes a feast and a holiday[fn-91-P9153_3331345:22-nf] . For the feast does not consist in pleasant intercourse at meals, nor splendour[fn-91-P9154_3331497:23-nf] of clothing, nor days of leisure, but in the acknowledgment of God, and the offering of thanksgiving and of praise to Him[fn-91-P9155_3331650:24-nf] .

For this is His glory, this the miracle of His divinity, that He changed our sufferings for His happiness.

Moses, for instance, `A prophet will the Lord raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; to him hearken in all that he commands you.' Isaiah again, `Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and ye shall call his name Emmanuel[fn-95-P9511_3433830:26-nf] .'

It was not accidental, therefore, but symbolical and mystical, that while the Jews were raging against Christ, a foreigner was found to share His sufferings, as the Apostle says, \"if we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him[fn-36-P3659_920914:7-nf] \"; so that no Hebrew nor Israelite, but a stranger, was substituted for the Saviour in His most holy degradation.

For of old He threatened our death with the power of His death, saying. by the mouth of Hosea the prophet, \"O death, I will be thy death, and I will be thy destruction, O hell[fn-36-P3677_926074:16-nf] .\" For by dying He underwent the laws of hell, but by rising again He broke them, and so destroyed the continuity of death as to make it temporal instead of eternal. \"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive[fn-36-P3678_926327:17-nf] .\" And so, dearly-beloved, let that come to pass of which S.

But in addition to all that has been said already, I wish to adduce still further proof, so that all may understand what impiety is contained in this assertion of yours. For if your allegation is true, that He was not born, then it will follow undoubtedly that He did not suffer; for it is not possible for one to suffer who was not also born. But if He did not suffer, then the name of the cross is done away with. And if the cross was not endured, then Jesus did not rise from the dead. And if Jesus rose not from the dead, then no other person will rise again. And if no one shall rise again, then there will be no judgment. For it is certain that, if I am not to rise again, I cannot be judged. But if there is to be no judgment, then the keeping of God's commandments will be to no purpose, and there will be no occasion for abstinence: nay, we may say, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\"[fn-38-P3885_1105023:596-nf] For all these consequences follow when you deny that He was born of Mary. But if you acknowledge that He was born of Mary, then His passion will necessarily follow, and His resurrection will be consequent on His passion, and the judgment on His resurrection: and thus the injunctions of Scripture will have their proper value[fn-38-P3886_1105371:597-nf] for us. This is not therefore an idle question, but there are the mightiest issues involved in this word. For just as all the law and the prophets are summed up in two words, so also all our hope is made to depend on the birth by the blessed Mary. Give me therefore an answer to these several questions which I shall address to you. How shall we get rid of these many words of the apostle, so important and so precise, which are expressed in terms like the following: \"But when the good pleasure of God was with us, He sent His Son, made of a woman; \"[fn-38-P3887_1105938:598-nf] and again, \"Christ our passover is sacrificed for us; \"[fn-38-P3888_1106264:599-nf] and once more, \"God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise up us together with Him by His own power? \"[fn-38-P3889_1106393:600-nf] And there are many other passages of a similar import; as, for example, this which follows: \"How say some among you,[fn-38-P3890_1106855:601-nf] that there is no resurrection of the dead? For if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain. Yea, and we shall be found false witnesses of God; who have testified against God that He raised up Christ: whom He raised not up. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ risen: and if Christ be not raised, your[fn-38-P3891_1107328:602-nf] faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins: Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable than all men. But now is Christ risen from the dead, the beginning[fn-38-P3892_1107639:603-nf] of them that sleep; \"[fn-38-P3893_1107677:604-nf] and so on. Who, then, I ask, can be found so rash and audacious as not to make his faith fit in with these sacred words, in which there is no qualification[fn-38-P3894_1107858:605-nf] nor any dubiety? Who, I ask you, O foolish Galatian, has bewitched you, as those were bewitched \"before whose eyes Jesus Christ was evidently set forth, crucified? \"[fn-38-P3895_1108043:606-nf] From all this I think that these testimonies should suffice in proof of the judgment, and the resurrection, and the passion; and the birth by Mary is also shown to be involved naturally and at once in these facts. And what matters it though you refuse to acquiesce in this, when the Scripture proclaims the fact most unmistakeably? Nevertheless I shall again put a question to you, and let it please you to give me an answer. When Jesus gave His testimony concerning John, and said, \"Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is less[fn-38-P3896_1108777:607-nf] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,\"[fn-38-P3897_1108837:608-nf] tell me what is meant by there being a greater than he in the kingdom of heaven. Was Jesus less in the kingdom of heaven than John? I say, God forbid! Tell me, then, how this is to be explained, and you will certainly surpass yourself. Without doubt the meaning is, that Jesus was less than John among those that are born of woman; but in the kingdom of heaven He is greater than he.[fn-38-P3898_1109242:609-nf] Wherefore tell me this too, O Manichaeus: If you say that Christ was not born of Mary, but that He only appeared like a man, while yet He was not really a man, the appearance being effected and produced by the power that is in Him, tell me, I repeat, on whom then was it that the Spirit descended like a dove? Who is this that was baptized by John? If He was perfect, if He was the Son, if He was the Power, the Spirit could not have entered into Him;[fn-38-P3899_1109977:610-nf] just as a kingdom cannot enter within a kingdom. And whose, too, was that voice which was sent forth out of heaven, and which gave Him this testimony, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased? \"[fn-39-P3900_1110992:611-nf] Come, tell me; make no delay; who is this that acquires[fn-39-P3901_1111070:612-nf] all these things, that does all these things?

For when Christ, your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory[fn-37-P3759_947261:22-nf] .\" Who with the Father, &c.","title":"Sermon LXIII.

On the one side, no doubt, we are flattered by deceits, and on the other weighed down by troubles; but because \"the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord[fn-38-P3891_987482:10-nf] ,\" Christ's victory is assuredly ours, that what He says may be fulfilled, \"Fear not, for I have overcome the world[fn-38-P3892_987618:11-nf] .\" Whether, then, we fight against the ambition of the world, or against the lusts of the flesh, or against the darts of heresy, let us arm ourselves always with the Lord's Cross. For our Paschal feast will never end, if we abstain from the leaven of the old wickedness (in the sincerity of truth[fn-38-P3893_987937:12-nf] . For amid all the changes of this life which is full of various afflictions, we ought to remember the Apostle's exhortation; whereby he instructs us, saying, \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: Who being in the form of God counted it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, being made in the likeness of men and found in fashion as a man. Wherefore God also exalted Him, and gave Him a name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven, of things on earth, and of things below, and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father[fn-38-P3894_988706:13-nf] .\" If, he says, you understand \"the mystery of great godliness,\" and remember what the Only-begotten Son of God did for the salvation of mankind, \"have that mind in you which was also in Christ Jesus,\" Whose humility is not to be scorned by any of the rich, not to be thought shame of by any of the high-born. For no human happiness whatever can reach so great a height as to reckon it a source of shame to himself that God, abiding in the form of Coy, thought it not unworthy of Himself to take the form of a slave.","title":"Sermon LXXII.
