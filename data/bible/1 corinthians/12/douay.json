{"verses":["Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have\nyou ignorant.","You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols,\naccording as you were led.","Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the\nSpirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus.  And no man can say The Lord\nJesus, but by the Holy Ghost.","Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.","And there are diversities of ministries.  but the same Lord.","And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who\nworketh all in all.","And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto\nprofit.","To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom:  and to\nanother, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:","To another, faith in the same spirit:  to another, the grace of\nhealing in one Spirit:","To another the working of miracles:  to another, prophecy:  to\nanother, the discerning of spirits:  to another, diverse kinds of\ntongues:  to another, interpretation of speeches.","But all these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing\nto every one according as he will.","For as the body is one and hath many members; and all the\nmembers of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body:  So also\nis Christ.","For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether\nJews or Gentiles, whether bond or free:  and in one Spirit we have all\nbeen made to drink.","For the body also is not one member, but many.","If the foot should say:  Because I am not the hand, I am not of\nthe body:  Is it therefore not of the Body?","And if the ear should say:  Because I am not the eye, I am not of\nthe body:  Is it therefore not of the body?","If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing?  If\nthe whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?","But now God hath set the members, every one of them, in the body\nas it hath pleased him.","And if they all were one member, where would be the body?","But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.","And the eye cannot say to the hand:  I need not thy help.

Are all prophets?  Are all doctors?","Are all workers of miracles?  Have all the grace of healing?  Do\nall speak with tongues?  Do all interpret?","But be zealous for the better gifts.  And I shew unto you yet a\nmore excellent way."]}
