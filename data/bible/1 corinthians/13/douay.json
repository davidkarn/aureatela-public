{"verses":["If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not\ncharity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.","And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and\nall knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove\nmountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.","And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if\nI should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it\nprofiteth me nothing.","Charity is patient, is kind:  charity envieth not, dealeth not\nperversely, is not puffed up,","Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger,\nthinketh no evil:","Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:","Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,\nendureth all things.","Charity never falleth away:  whether prophecies shall be made void\nor tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.","For we know in part:  and we prophesy in part.","But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part\nshall be done away.","When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child,\nI thought as a child.  But, when I became a man, I put away the things\nof a child.","We see now through a glass in a dark manner:  but then face to\nface.  Now I know in part:  but then I shall know even as I am known.","And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three:  but\nthe greatest of these is charity."]}
