In love has the Lord taken us to Himself.

Yet unless the very same were the Son of man on account of the form of a servant which He took, who is the Son of God on account of the form of God in which He is; Paul the apostle would not say of the princes of this world, \"For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-3-P388_134737:164-nf] For He was crucified after the form of a servant, and yet \"the Lord of glory\" was crucified. For that \"taking\" was such as to make God man, and man God. Yet what is said on account of what, and what according to what, the thoughtful, diligent, and pious reader discerns for himself, the Lord being his helper. For instance, we have said that He glorifies His own, as being God, and certainly then as being the Lord of glory; and yet the Lord of glory was crucified, because even God is rightly said to have been crucified, not after the power of the divinity, but after the weakness of the flesh:[fn-3-P389_135355:165-nf] just as we say, that He judges as God, that is, by divine power, not by human; and yet the man Himself will judge, just as the Lord of glory was crucified: for soHe expressly says, \"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, and before Him shall be gathered all nations;\"[fn-3-P390_135686:166-nf] and the rest that is foretold of the future judgment in that place even to the last sentence. And the Jews, inasmuch as they will be punished in that judgment for persisting in their wickedness, as it is elsewhere written, \"shall look upon Him whom they have pierced.\"[fn-3-P391_135981:167-nf] For whereas both good and bad shall see the Judge of the quick and dead, without doubt the bad will not be able to see Him, except after the form in which He is the Son of man; but yet in the glory wherein He will judge, not in the lowliness wherein He was judged. But the ungodly without doubt will not see that form of God in which He is equal to the Father. For they are not pure in heart; and \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\"[fn-3-P392_136457:168-nf] And that sight is face to face,[fn-3-P393_136508:169-nf] the very sight that is promised as the highest reward to the just, and which will then take place when He \"shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;\" and in this \"kingdom\" He means the sight of His own form also to be understood, the whole creature being made subject to God, including that wherein the Son of God was made the Son of man. Because, according to this creature, \"The Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him, that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.\"[fn-3-P394_137036:170-nf] Otherwise if the Son of God, judging in the form in which He is equal to the Father, shall appear when He judges to the ungodly also; what becomes of that which He promises, as some great thing, to him who loves Him, saying, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him?\"[fn-3-P395_137342:171-nf] Wherefore He will judge as the Son of man, yet not by human power, but by that whereby He is the Son of God; and on the other hand, He will judge as the Son of God, yet not appearing in that [unincarnate] form in which He is God equal to the Father, but in that [incarnate form] in which He is the Son of man.[fn-3-P396_137673:172-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Not unfitly is it commonly understood to be prefigured from the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, that His \"back parts\" are to be taken to be His flesh, in which He was born of the Virgin, and died, and rose again; whether they are called back parts[fn-6-P603_223444:104-nf] on account of the posteriority of mortality, or because it was almost in the end of the world, that is, at a late period,[fn-6-P604_223587:105-nf] that He deigned to take it: but that His \"face\" was that form of God, in which He \"thought it not robbery to be equal with God,\"[fn-6-P605_223735:106-nf] which no one certainly can see and live; whether because after this life, in which we are absent from the Lord,[fn-6-P606_223867:107-nf] and where the corruptible body presseth down the soul,[fn-6-P607_223942:108-nf] we shall see \"face to facet,\"[fn-6-P608_223993:109-nf] as the apostle says-(for it is said in the Psalms, of this life, \"Verily every man living is altogether vanity;\"[fn-6-P609_224130:110-nf] and again, \"For in Thy sight shall no man living be justified;\"[fn-6-P610_224215:111-nf] and in this life also, according to John, \"It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know,\" he says, \"that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is,\"[fn-6-P611_224426:112-nf] which he certainly intended to be understood as after this life, when we shall have paid the debt of death, and shall have received the promise of the resurrection);-or whether that even now, in whatever degree we spiritually understand the wisdom of God, by which all things were made, in that same degree we die to carnal affections, so that, considering this world dead to us, we also ourselves die to this world, and say what the apostle says, \"The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.\"[fn-6-P612_224952:113-nf] For it was of this death that he also says, \"Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ, why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances?\"[fn-6-P613_225120:114-nf] Not therefore without cause will no one be able to see the \"face,\" that is, the manifestation itself of the wisdom of God, and live.

For when he had said, on account of the love of God with which he was specially inflamed, \"If I have found grace in thy sight, show me now Thyself plainly, that I may find grace in Thy sight;\" he immediately subjoined, on account of the love also of his neighbor, \"And that I may know that this nation is Thy people.\" It is therefore that \"appearance\" which hurries away every rational soul with the desire of it, and the more ardently the more pure that soul is; and it is the more pure the more it rises to spiritual things; and it rises the more to spiritual things the more it dies to carnal things. But whilst we are absent from the Lord, and walk by faith, not by sight,[fn-6-P615_226405:116-nf] we ought to see the \"back parts\" of Christ, that is His flesh, by that very faith, that is, standing on the solid foundation of faith, which the rock signifies,[fn-6-P616_226589:117-nf] and beholding it from such a safe watch-tower, namely in the Catholic Church, of which it is said, \"And upon this rock I will build my Church.\"[fn-6-P617_226876:118-nf] For so much the more certainly we love that face of Christ, which we earnestly desire to see, as we recognize in His back parts how much first Christ loved us.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"220","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"You know yourselves how slippery is the path of youth-a path on which I have myself fallen,[fn-2-P261_44721:110-nf] and which you are now traversing not without fear.

But the Lord has used the word which He employs in a general sense: \"Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" For he also who neither wishes nor understands what he says, seems to say it; but he properly says it, who gives expression to his will and mind by the sound of his voice: just as, a little before, what is called \"joy\" among the fruits of the Spirit is called so in a strict and proper sense, not in the way in which the same apostle elsewhere uses the expression, \"Rejoiceth not in iniquity:\"[fn-9-P950_371763:231-nf] as if any one could rejoice in iniquity: for that transport of a mind making confused and boisterous demonstrations of joy is not joy; for this latter is possessed by the good alone.

Therefore the first commandment about righteousness, which bids us love the Lord with all our heart, and soul, and mind[fn-18-P1833_801299:382-nf] (the next to which is, that we love our neighbour as ourselves), we shall completely fulfil in that life when we shall see face to face.[fn-18-P1834_801459:383-nf] But even now this commandment is enjoined upon us, that we may be reminded what we ought by faith to require, and what we should in our hope look forward to, and, \"forgetting the things which are behind, reach forth to the things which are before.\"[fn-18-P1835_801732:384-nf] And thus, as it appears to me, that man has made a far advance, even in the present life, in the righteousness which is to be perfected hereafter, who has discovered by this very advance how very far removed he is from the completion of righteousness.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_08_book_i_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"145","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"62.

For what saith he? \"He did shine as the Sun.\"[fn-6-P649_376688:33-nf] But the glory of incorruptible bodies does not emit the same kind of light as this body which is corruptible, nor is it of a kind to be tolerable to mortal eyes, but needs incorruptible and immortal eyes to contemplate it. But at that time on the mountain He disclosed to them as much as it was possible for them to see without injuring the sight of the beholders; and even so they could not endure it but fell upon their faces. Tell me, if any one led thee into some bright place, where all were sitting arrayed in vestures of gold, and in the midst of the multitude pointed out one other to thee who alone had garments wrought with precious stones, and a crown upon his head, and then promised to place thee in the ranks of this people, wouldst thou not do everything to obtain this promise? Open then even now in imagination thine eyes, and look on that assembly, composed not of men such as we are, but of those who are of more value than gold and previous stones, and the beams of the sun, and all visible radiance, and not consisting of men only but of beings of much more dignity than men,-angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers. For as concerning the king it is not even possible to say what he is like: so completely do his beauty, his grace, his splendour, his glory, his grandeur and magnificence elude speech and thought. Shall we then, I ask, deprive ourselves of such great blessings, in order to avoid suffering for a brief period?

We certainly seek a trinity,-not any trinity, but that Trinity which is God, and the true and supreme and only God. Let my hearers then wait, for we are still seeking. And no one justly finds fault with such a search, if at least he who seeks that which either to know or to utter is most difficult, is steadfast in the faith. But whosoever either sees or teaches better, finds fault quickly and justly with any one who confidently affirms concerning it. \"Seek God,\" he says, \"and your heart shall live;\"[fn-13-P1312_584545:1-nf] and lest any one should rashly rejoice that he has, as it were, apprehended it, \"Seek,\" he says, \"His face evermore.\"[fn-13-P1313_584680:2-nf] And the apostle: \"if any man,\" he says, \"think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. But if any man love God, the same is known of Him.\"[fn-13-P1314_584863:3-nf] He has not said, has known Him, which is dangerous presumption, but \"is known of Him.\" So also in another place, when he had said, \"But now after that ye have known God:\" immediately correcting himself, he says, \"or rather are known of God.\"[fn-13-P1315_585124:4-nf] And above all in that other place, \"Brethren,\" he says, \"I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press in purpose[fn-13-P1316_585378:5-nf] toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.\"[fn-13-P1317_585539:6-nf] Perfection in this life, he tells us, is nothing else than to forget those things which are behind, and to reach forth and press in purpose toward those things which are before. For he that seeks has the safest purpose, [who seeks] until that is taken hold of whither we are tending, and for which we are reaching forth. But that is the right purpose which starts from faith. For a certain faith is in some way the starting-point of knowledge; but a certain knowledge will not be made perfect, except after this life, when we shall see face to face.[fn-13-P1318_586110:7-nf] Let us therefore be thus minded, so as to know that the disposition to seek the truth is more safe than that which presumes things unknown to be known. Let us therefore so seek as if we should find, and so find as if we were about to seek. For \"when a man hath done, then he beginneth.\"[fn-13-P1319_586417:8-nf] Let us doubt without unbelief of things to be believed; let us affirm without rashness of things to be understood: authority must be held fast in the former, truth sought out in the latter. As regards this question, then, let us believe that theFather, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one God, the Creator and Ruler of the whole creature; and that the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit either the Father or the Son, but a trinity of persons mutually interrelated, and a unity of an equal essence. And let us seek to understand this, praying for help from Himself, whom we wish to understand; and as much as He grants, desiring to explain what we understand with so much pious care and anxiety, that even if in any case we say one thing for another, we may at least say nothing unworthy. As, for the sake of example, if we say anything concerning the Father that does not properly belong to the Father, or does belong to the Son, or to the Holy Spirit, or to the Trinity itself; and if anything of the Son which does not properly suit with the Son, or at all events which does suit with the Father, or with the Holy Spirit, or with the Trinity; or if, again, anything concerning the Holy Spirit, which is not fitly a property of the Holy Spirit, yet is not alien from the Father, or from the Son, or from the one God the Trinity itself. Even as now our wish is to see whether the Holy Spirit is properly that love which is most excellent which if He is not, either the Father is love, or the Son, or the Trinity itself; since we cannot withstand the most certain faith and weighty authority of Scripture, saying, \"God is love.\"[fn-13-P1320_588079:9-nf] And yet we ought not to deviate into profane error, so as to say anything of the Trinity which does not suit the Creator, but rather the creature, or which is feigned outright by mere empty thought.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_16_book_viii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"1.

No one blushes at his own improvement. Even in Christ, knowledge had its stages of growth;[fn-12-P1294_354442:10-nf] through which stages the apostle, too, passed. \"When I was a child,\" he says, \"as a child I spake, as a child I understood; but when I became a man, those (things) which had been the child's I abandoned: \"[fn-12-P1295_354670:11-nf] so truly did he turn away from his early opinions: nor did he sin by becoming an emulator not of ancestral but of Christian traditions,[fn-12-P1296_354848:12-nf] wishing even the precision of them who advised the retention of circumcision.[fn-12-P1297_354970:13-nf] And would that the same fate might befall those, too, who obtruncate the pure and true integrity of the flesh; amputating not the extremest superficies, but the inmost image of modesty itself, while they promise pardon to adulterers and fornicators, in the teeth of the primary discipline of the Christian Name; a discipline to which heathendom itself bears such emphatic witness, that it strives to punish that discipline in the persons of our females rather by defilements of the flesh than tortures; wishing to wrest from them that which they hold dearer than life! But now this glory is being extinguished, and that by means of those who ought with all the more constancy to refuse concession of any pardon to defilements of this kind, that they make the fear of succumbing to adultery and fornication their reason for marrying as often as they please-since \"better it is to marry than to burn.\"[fn-12-P1298_355891:14-nf] No doubt it is for continence sake that incontinence is necessary-the \"burning\" will be extinguished by \"fires!\" Why, then, do they withal grant indulgence, under the name of repentance, to crimes for which they furnish remedies by their law of multinuptialism? For remedies will be idle while crimes are indulged, and crimes will remain if remedies are idle. And so, either way, they trifle with solicitude and negligence; by taking emptiest precaution against (crimes) to which they grant quarter, and granting absurdest quarter to (crimes) against which they take precaution: whereas either precaution is not to be taken where quarter is given, or quarter not given where precaution is taken; for they take precaution, as if they were unwilling that something should be committed; but grant indulgence, as if they were willing it should be committed: whereas, if they be unwilling it should be committed, they ought not to grant indulgence; if they be willing to grant indulgence, they ought not to take precaution. For, again, adultery and fornication will not be ranked at the same time among the moderate and among the greatest sins, so that each course may be equally open with regard to them-the solicitude which takes precaution, and the security which grants indulgence. But since they are such as to hold the culminating place among crimes, there is no room at once for their indulgence as if they were moderate, and for their precaution as if they were greatest But by us precaution is thus also taken against the greatest, or, (if you will), highest (crimes, viz.,) in that it is not permitted, after believing, to know even a second marriage, differentiated though it be, to be sure, from the work of adultery and fornication by the nuptial and dotal tablets: and accordingly, with the utmost strictness, we excommunicate digamists, as bringing infamy upon the Paraclete by the irregularity of their discipline. The self-same liminal limit we fix for adulterers also and fornicators; dooming them to pour forth tears barren of peace, and to regain from the Church no ampler return than the publication of their disgrace.","title":"VII.

And there are diversities of operations, but the same God who worketh all things in all. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.\" And again:[fn-68-P6822_2165763:205-nf] \"As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.\" But he precludes you from saying that the different members of the one body have the same rank; for he immediately describes the orders of the Church, and says:[fn-68-P6823_2166070:206-nf] \"And God hath set some in the Church, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And a still more excellent way shew I unto you.\" And after discoursing more in detail of the graces of charity, he added:[fn-68-P6824_2166593:207-nf] \"Whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" And afterwards we read:[fn-68-P6825_2166957:208-nf] \"But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.\" And again:[fn-68-P6826_2167182:209-nf] \"I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues.\" And again:[fn-68-P6827_2167365:210-nf] \"I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all.\" Where there are different gifts, and one man is greater, another less, and all are called spiritual, they are all certainly sheep, and they stand on the right hand; but there is a difference between one sheep and another. It is humility that leads the Apostle Paul to say:[fn-68-P6828_2167716:211-nf] \"I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain: but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\" But the very fact of his thus humbling himself shows the possibility of there being apostles of higher or lower rank, and God is not unjust that lie will forget tim work of him who is called the chosen vessel of election, and who laboured more abundantly than they all, or assign equal rewards to unequal deserts. Afterwards we read,[fn-68-P6829_2168400:212-nf] \"As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be now alive.

There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.\" Like a learned commentator, you have explained this passage by saying that the spiritual differ from the carnal. It follows that in heaven there will be both spiritual and carnal persons, and not only will the sheep climb thither, but your goats also. \"One star,\" he says, \"differeth from another star in glory\": this is not the distinction of sheep and goat, but of sheep and sheep, star and star.

For to faith and hope shall succeed at once the very substance itself, no longer to be believed in and hoped for, but to be seen and grasped. Love, however, which is the greatest among the three, is not to be superseded, but increased and fulfilled,-contemplating in full vision what it used to see by faith, and acquiring in actual fruition what it once only embraced in hope. Then in all this plenitude of charity will be fulfilled the commandment, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\"[fn-25-P2517_1013842:61-nf] For while there remains any remnant of the lust of the flesh, to be kept in check by the rein of continence, God is by no means loved with all one's soul. For the flesh does not lust without the soul; although it is the flesh which is said to lust, because the soul lusts carnally. In that perfect state the just man shall live absolutely without any sin, since there will be in his members no law warring against the law of his mind,[fn-25-P2518_1014401:62-nf] but wholly will he love God, with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his mind[fn-25-P2519_1014510:63-nf] which is the first and chief commandment. For why should not such perfection be enjoined on man, although in this life nobody may attain to it? For we do not rightly run if we do not know whither we are to run. But how could it be known, unless it were pointed out in precepts?[fn-25-P2520_1014809:64-nf] Let us therefore \"so run that we may obtain.\"[fn-25-P2521_1014911:65-nf] For all who run rightly will obtain,-not as in the contest of the theatre, where all indeed run, but only one wins the prize.[fn-25-P2522_1015057:66-nf] Let us run, believing, hoping, longing; let us run, subjugating the body, cheerfully and heartily doing alms,-in giving kindnesses and forgiving injuries, praying that our strength may be helped as we run; and let us so listen to the commandments which urge us to perfection, as not to neglect running towards the fulness of love.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_19_book_xiii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"26. For we wished to ascend, as it were, by steps, and to seek in the inner man, both in knowledge and in wisdom, a sort of trinity of its own special kind, such as we sought before in the outer man; in order that we may come, with a mind more practised in these lower things, to the contemplation of that Trinity which is God, according to our little measure, if indeed, we can even do this, at least in a riddle and as through a glass.[fn-17-P1734_866694:59-nf] If, then, any one have committed to memory the words of this faith in their sounds alone, not knowing what they mean, as they commonly who do not know Greek hold in memory Greek words, or similarly Latin ones, or thoseof any other language of which they are ignorant, has not he a sort of trinity in his mind? because, first, those sounds of words are in his memory, even when he does not think thereupon; and next, the mental vision (acies) of his act of recollection is formed thence when he conceives of them; and next, the will of him who remembers and thinks unites both. Yet we should by no means say that the man in so doing busies himself with a trinity of the interior man, but rather of the exterior; because he remembers, and when he wills, contemplates as much as he wills, that alone which belongs to the sense of the body, which is called hearing. Nor in such an act of thought does he do anything else than deal with images of corporeal things, that is, of sounds. But if he holds and recollects what those words signify, now indeed something of the inner man is brought into action; not yet, however, ought he to be said or thought to live according to a trinity of the tuner man, if he does not love those things which are there declared, enjoined, promised. For it is possible for him also to hold and conceive these things, supposing them to be false, in order that he may endeavor to disprove them. Therefore that will, which in this case unites those things which are held in the memory with those things which are thence impressed on the mind's eye in conception, completes, indeed, some kind of trinity, since itself is a third added to two others; but the man does not live according to this, when those things which are conceived are taken to be false, and are not accepted. But when those things are believed to be true, and those things which therein ought to be loved, are loved, then at last the man does live according to a trinity of the inner man; for every one lives according to that which he loves. But how can things be loved which are not known, but only believed? This question has been already treated of in former books;[fn-17-P1735_868877:60-nf] and we found, that no one loves what he is wholly ignorant of, but that when things not known are said to be loved, they are loved from those things which are known. And now we so conclude this book, that we admonish the just to live by faith,[fn-17-P1736_869171:61-nf] which faith worketh by love,[fn-17-P1737_869218:62-nf] so that the virtues also themselves, by which one lives prudently, boldly, temperately, and justly, be all referred to the same faith; for not otherwise can they be true virtues. And yet these in this life are not of so great worth, as that the remission of sins, of some kind or other, is not sometimes necessary here; and this remission comes not to pass, except through Him, who by His own blood conquered the prince of sinners. Whatsoever ideas are in the mind of the faithful man from this faith, and from such a life, when they are contained in the memory, and are looked at by recollection, and please the will, set forth a kind of trinity of its own sort.[fn-17-P1738_869898:63-nf] But the image of God, of which by His help we shall afterwards speak, is not yet in that trinity; a thing which will then be more apparent, when it shall have been shown where it is, which the reader may expect in a succeeding book.

In disputing, then, about wisdom, they have defined it thus: Wisdom is the knowledge of things human and divine. And hence, in the last book, I have not withheld the admission, that the cognizance of both subjects, whether divine or human, may be called both knowledge and wisdom.[fn-17-P1760_874868:12-nf] But according to the distinction made in the apostle's words, \"To one is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,\"[fn-17-P1761_875028:13-nf] this definition is to be divided, so that the knowledge of things divine shall be called wisdom, and that of things human appropriate to itself the name of knowledge; and of the latter I have treated in the thirteenth book, not indeed so as to attribute to this knowledge everything whatever that can be known by man about things human, wherein there is exceeding much of empty vanity and mischievous curiosity, but only those things by which that most wholesome faith, which leads to true blessedness, is begotten, nourished, defended, strengthened; and in this knowledge most of the faithful are not strong, however exceeding strong in the faith itself. For it is one thing to know only what man ought to believe in order to attain to a blessed life, which must needs be an eternal one; but another to know in what way this belief itself may both help the pious, and be defended against the impious, which last the apostle seems to call by the special name of knowledge. And when I was speaking of this knowledge before, my especial business was to commend faith, first briefly distinguishing things eternal from things temporal, and there discoursing of things temporal; but while deferring things eternal to the present book, I showed also that faith respecting things eternal is itself a thing temporal, and dwells in time in the hearts of believers, and yet is necessary in order to attain the things eternal themselves.[fn-17-P1762_876477:14-nf] I argued also, that faith respecting the things temporal which He that is eternal did and suffered for us as man, which manhood He bare in time and carried on to things eternal, is profitable also for the obtaining of things eternal; and that the virtues themselves, whereby in this temporal and mortal life men live prudently, bravely, temperately, and justly, are not true virtues, unless they are referred to that same faith, temporal though it is, which leads on nevertheless to things eternal.","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"4.

For when the human mind sees its own faith, whereby it believes what it does not see, it does not see a thing eternal. For that will not always exist, which certainly will not then exist, when this pilgrimage, whereby we are absent from God, in such way that we must needs walk by faith, shall be ended, and that sight shall have succeeded it whereby we shall see face to face;[fn-17-P1768_878147:17-nf] just as now, because we believe although we do not see, we shall deserve to see, and shall rejoice at having been brought through faith to sight. For then it will be no longer faith, by which that is believed which is not seen; but sight, by which that is seen which is believed. And then, therefore, although we remember this past mortal life, and call to mind by recollection that we once believed what we did not see, yet that faith will be reckoned among things past and done with, not among things present and always continuing. And hence also that trinity which now consists in the remembering, contemplating, and loving this same faith while present and continuing, will then be found to be done with and past, and not still enduring. And hence it is to be gathered, that if that trinity is indeed an image of God, then this image itself would have to be reckoned, not among things that exist always, but among things transient.","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"23. Certainly this renewal does not take place in the single moment of conversion itself, as that renewal in baptism takes place in a single moment by the remission of all sins; for not one, be it ever so small, remains unremitted. But as it is one thing to be free from fever, and another to grow strong again from the infirmity which the fever produced; and one thing again to pluck out of the body a weapon thrust into it, and another to heal the wound thereby made by a prosperous cure; so the first cure is to remove the causeof infirmity, and this is wrought by the forgiving of all sins; but the second cure is to heal the infirmity itself, and this takes place gradually by making progress in the renewal of that image: which two things are plainly shown in the Psalm, where we read, \"Who forgiveth all thine iniquities,\" which takes place in baptism; and then follows, \"and healeth all thine infirmities;\"[fn-18-P1868_936790:63-nf] and this takes place by daily additions, while this image is being renewed.[fn-18-P1869_936884:64-nf] And the apostle has spoken of this most expressly, saying, \"And though our outward man perish, yet the inner man is renewed day by day.\"[fn-18-P1870_937678:65-nf] And \"it is renewed in the knowledge of God, i.e. in righteousness and true holiness,\" according to the testimonies of the apostle cited a little before.

We have endeavored, then, so to do; in order that we might see in some ;way or other by this image which we are, Him by whom we are made, as by a glass. And this is intimated also in the words of the same apostle: \"But we with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\"[fn-19-P1955_984406:27-nf] \"Beholding as in a glass,\"[fn-19-P1956_984454:28-nf] he has said, i.e. seeing by means of a glass, not looking from a watch-tower: an ambiguity that does not exist in the Greek language, whence the apostolic epistles have been rendered into Latin. For in Greek, a glass,[fn-19-P1957_984690:29-nf] in which the images of things are visible, is wholly distinct in the sound of the word also from a watch-tower,[fn-19-P1958_984817:30-nf] from the height of which we command a more distant view. And it is quite plain that the apostle, in using the word \"speculantes\" in respect to the glory of the Lord, meant it to come from \"speculum,\" not from \"specula.\" But where he says, \"We are transformed into the same image,\" he assuredly means to speak of the image of God; and by calling it \"the same,\" he means that very image which we see in the glass, because that same image is also the glory of the Lord; as he says elsewhere, \"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God,\"[fn-19-P1959_985415:31-nf] -a text already discussed in the twelfth book.

For it is said of human nature in itself, \"The man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God.\" And this nature, being the most excellent among things created, is transformed from a form that is defaced into a form that is beautiful, when it is justified by its own Creator from ungodliness. Since even in ungodliness itself, the more the faultiness is to be condemned, the more certainly is the nature to be praised. And therefore he has added, \"from glory to glory:\" from the glory of creation to the glory of justification.

For without the gift of God, that is, without the Holy Spirit, through whom love is shed abroad in our hearts,[fn-27-P2770_1283255:230-nf] the law can command, but it cannot assist; and, moreover, it makes a man a transgressor, for he can no longer excuse himself on the plea of ignorance.

But, granting that he wrote this,-since you will not hear of anything being spurious in his writings,-it is not against us. For this seems to be Paul's old belief about Jesus, when he thought, like everybody else, that Jesus was the son of David. Afterwards, when he learned that this was false, he corrects himself; and in his Epistle to the Corinthians he says: \"We know no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more.\"[fn-13-P1338_706498:2-nf] Observe the difference between these two verses. In one he asserts that Jesus was the son of David after the flesh; in the other he says that now he knows no man after the flesh. If Paul wrote both, it can only have been in the way I have stated. In the next verse he adds: \"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\" The belief that Jesus was born of the seed of David according to the flesh is of this old transitory kind; whereas the faith which knows no man after the flesh is new and permanent. So, he says elsewhere: \"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.\"[fn-13-P1339_707259:3-nf] We are thus warranted in preferring the new and amended confession of Paul to his old and faulty one. And if you hold by what is said in the Epistle to the Romans, why should not we hold by what is said to the Corinthians? But it is only by your insisting on the correctness of the text that we are made to represent Paul as build ins again the things which he destroyed, in spite of his own repudiation of such prevarication.

The context of the passage containing this clause of which our adversaries make such a bad use, brings out its real meaning. \"The love of Christ,\" we read, \"constrains us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to Him who died for them, and rose again. Therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; and though we have known Christ after the flesh, ret now henceforth know we Him no more.\" The words, \"that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them, and rose again,\" show plainly that the resurrection of Christ is the ground of the apostle's statement. To live not to themselves, but to Him, must mean to live not after the flesh, in the hope of earthly and perishable goods, but after the spirit, in the hope of resurrection,-a resurrection already accomplished in Christ. Of those, then, for whom Christ died and rose again, and who live henceforth not to themselves, but to Him, the Apostle says that he knows no one after the flesh, on account of the hope of future immortality to which they were looking forward,-a hope which in Christ was already a reality. So, though he has known Christ after the flesh, before His death, now he knows Him no more; for he knows that He has risen, and that death has no more dominion over Him. And because in Christ we all are even now in hope, though not in reality, what Christ is, he adds: \"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself by Christ.\"[fn-13-P1366_727877:23-nf] What the new creature -that is, the people renewed by faith-hopes for regarding itself, it has already in Christ; and the hope will also hereafter be actually realized. And, as regards this hope, old things have passed away, because we are no longer in the times of the Old Testament, expecting a temporal and carnal kingdom of God; and all things are become new, making the promise of the kingdom of heaven, where there shall be no death or corruption, the ground of our confidence. But in the resurrection of the dead it will not be as a matter of hope, but in reality, that old things shall pass away, when the last enemy, death, shall be destroyed; and all things shall become new when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality. This has already taken place in Christ, whom Paul accordingly, in reality, knew no longer after the flesh. But not yet in reality, but only in hope, did he know no one after the flesh of those for whom Christ died and rose again. For, as he says to the Ephesians, we are already saved by grace. The whole passage is to the purpose: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we have been saved.\" The words, \"hath quickened us together with Christ,\" correspond to what he said to the Corinthians, \"that they which live should no longer live to themselves, but to Him that died for them and rose again.\" And in the words,\"by whose grace we have been saved,\" he speaks of the thing hoped for as already accomplished. So, in the passage quoted above, he says explicitly, \"We have been saved by hope.\" And here he proceeds to specify future events as if already accomplished. \"And has raised us up together,\" he says, \"and has made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\" Christ is certainly already seated in heavenly places, but we not yet. But as in an assured hope we already possess the future, he says that we sit in heavenly places, not in ourselves, but in Him. And to show that it is still future, in case it should be thought that what is spoken of as accomplished in hope has been accomplished in reality, he adds, \"that He might show in the ages to come the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-13-P1367_730242:24-nf] So also we must understand the following passage: \"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.\"[fn-13-P1368_730445:25-nf] He says, \"when we were in the flesh,\" as if they were no longer in the flesh. He means to say, when we were in the hope of fleshly things, referring to the time when the law, which can be fulfilled only by spiritual love, was in force, in order that by transgression the offence might abound, that after the revelation of the New Testament, grace and the gift by grace might much more abound. And to the same effect he says elsewhere, \"They which are in the flesh cannot please God;\" and then, to show that he does not mean those not yet dead, he adds, \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.\"[fn-13-P1369_731066:26-nf] The meaning is, those who are in the hope of fleshly good cannot please God; but you are not in the hope of fleshly things, but in the hope of spiritual things, that is, of the kingdom of heaven, where the body itself, which now is natural, will, by the change in the resurrection, be, according to the capacity of its nature, a spiritual body. For \"it is sown a natural body, it will be raised a spiritual body.\" If, then, the apostle knew no one after the flesh of those who were said to be not in the flesh, because they were not in the hope of fleshly things, although they still were burdened with corruptible and mortal flesh; how much more significantly could he say of Christ that he no longer knew Him after the flesh, seeing that in the body of Christ what they hoped for had already been accomplished! Surely it is better and more reverential to examine the passages of sacred Scripture so as to discover their agreement with one another, than to accept some as true, and condemn others as false, whenever any difficulty occurs beyond the power of our weak intellect to solve. As to the apostle in his childhood understanding as a child, this is said merely as an illustration.[fn-13-P1370_732278:27-nf] And when he was a child he was not a spiritual man, as he was when he produced for the edification of the churches those writings which are not, as other books, merely a profitable study, but which authoritatively claim our belief as part of the ecclesiastical canon.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_106_letter_cvi_to_anatolius_bishop_of_constantinople_in_rebuke_of_his_self_seeking_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"In thus writing to you, brother, I exhort and admonish you in the Lord, laying aside all ambitious desires to cherish rather a spirit of love and to adorn yourself to your profit with the virtues of love, according to the Apostle's teaching.

From the delight, too, which they exhibit, I gather that they derive some profit from it.

Even, so, on your side also, the very fact that persons who require to be instructed in the faith are brought so frequently to you, ought to help you to understand that your discourse is not displeasing to others as it is displeasing to yourself; and you ought not to consider yourself unfruitful, simply because you do not succeed in setting forth in such a manner as you desire the things which you discern; for, perchance, you may be just as little able to discern them in the way you wish. For in this life who sees except as \"in an enigma and through a glass\"?[fn-28-P2829_1301255:8-nf] Neither is love itself of might sufficient to rend the darkness of the flesh, and penetrate into that eternal calm from which even things which pass away derive the light in which they shine.

And in reality we are listened to with much greater satisfaction, indeed, when we ourselves also have pleasure in the same work; for the thread of our address is affected by the very joy of which we ourselves are sensible, and it proceeds from us with greater ease and with more acceptance. Consequently, as regards those matters which are recommended as articles of belief, the task is not a difficult one to lay down injunctions, with respect to the points at which the narration should be commenced and ended, or with respect to the method in which the narration is to be varied, so that at one time it may be briefer, at another more lengthened, and yet at all times full and perfect; and, again, with respect to the particular occasions on which it may be right to use the shorter form, and those on which it will be proper to employ the longer. But as to the means by which all is to be done, so that every one may have pleasure in his work when he catechises (for the better he succeeds in this the more attractive will he be),-that is what requires the greatest consideration.

For if, in the matter of carnal means, God loves a cheerful giver,[fn-28-P2832_1303259:11-nf] how much more so in that of the spiritual? But our security that this cheerfulness may be with us at the seasonable hour, is something dependent upon the mercy of Him who has given us such precepts. Therefore, in accordance with my understanding of what your own wish is, we shall discuss in the first place the subject of the method of narration, then that of the duty of delivering injunction and exhortation, and afterwards that of the attainment of the said cheerfulness, so far as God may furnish us with the ideas.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":50,"source_paragraph":"165","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let him who has love in Christ keep the commandments of Christ.

For it is written they say, \"As the moth consumes the garment, and the worm the wood, so does grief consume the heart of a man.\"[fn-41-P4138_2275883:16-nf] But they who make no doubt that in that future punishment both body and soul shall suffer, affirm that the body shall be burned with fire, while the soul shall be, as it were, gnawed by a worm of anguish. Though this view is more reasonable,-for it is absurd to suppose that either body or soul will escape pain in the future punishment,-yet, for my own part, I find it easier to understand both as referring to the body than to suppose that neither does; and I think that Scripture is silent regarding the spiritual pain of the damned, because, though not expressed, it is necessarily understood that in a body thus tormented the soul also is tortured with a fruitless repentance. For we read in the ancient Scriptures, \"The vengeance of the flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms.\"[fn-41-P4139_2276684:17-nf] It might have been more briefly said, \"The vengeance of the ungodly.\" Why, then, was it said, \"The flesh of the ungodly,\" unless because both the fire and the worm are to be the punishment of the flesh? Or if the object of the writer in saying, \"The vengeance of the flesh,\" was to indicate that this shall be the punishment of those who live after the flesh (for this leads to the second death, as the apostle intimated when he said, \"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die\"[fn-41-P4140_2277188:18-nf] , let each one make his own choice, either assigning the fire to the body and the worm to the soul,-the one figuratively, the other really,-or assigning both really to the body. For I have already sufficiently made out that animals can live in the fire, in burning without being consumed, in without dying, by a miracle of the most omnipotent Creator, to whom no one can deny that this is possible, if he be not ignorant by whom has been made all that is wonderful in all nature. For it is God Himself who has wrought all these miracles, great and small, in this world which I have mentioned, and incomparably more which I have omitted, and who has enclosed these marvels in this world, itself the greatest miracle of all. Let each man, then, choose which he will, whether he thinks that the worm is real and pertains to the body, or that spiritual things are meant by bodily representations, and that it belongs to the soul. But which of these is true will be more readily discovered by the facts themselves, when there shall be in the saints such knowledge as shall not require that their own experience teach them the nature of these punishments, but as shall, by its own fullness and perfection, suffice to instruct them in this matter. For \"now we know in part, until that which is perfect is come;\"[fn-41-P4141_2278513:19-nf] only, this we believe about those future bodies, that they shall be such as shall certainly be pained by the fire.","title":"Book XXI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_27_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"20. Those parties oppose this opinion who think that the said communion, which we call either Godhead, or Love, or Charity, is not a substance. Moreover, they require the Holy Spirit to be set forth to them according to substance; neither do they take it to have been otherwise impossible for the expression God is Love\" to have been used, unless love were a substance. In this, indeed, they are influenced by the wont of things of a bodily nature. For if two bodies are connected with each other in such wise as to be placed in juxtaposition one with the other, the connection itself is not a body: inasmuch as when these bodies which had been connected are separated, no such connection certainly is found [any more]; while, at the same time, it is not understood to have departed, as it were, and migrated, as is the case with those bodies themselves. But men like these should make their heart pure, so far as they can, in order that they may have power to see that in the substance of God there is not anything of such a nature as would imply that therein substance is one thing, and that which is accident to substance (aliud quod accidat subsantioe) another thing, and not substance; whereas whatsoever can be taken to be therein is substance. These things, however, can easily be spoken and believed; but seen, so as to reveal how they are in themselves, they absolutely cannot be, except by the pure heart. For which reason, whether the opinion in question be true, or something else be the case, the faith ought to be maintained unshaken, so that we should call the Father God, the Son God, the Holy Spirit God, and yet not affirm three Gods, but hold the said Trinity to be one God; and again, not affirm these [Persons] to be different in nature, but hold them to be of the same substance; and further uphold it, not as if the Father were sometime the Son, and sometime the Holy Spirit, but in such wise that the Father is always the Father, and the Son always the Son, and the Holy Spirit always the Holy Spirit. Neither should we make any affirmation on the subject of things unseen rashly, as if we had knowledge, but [only modestly] as believing. For these things cannot be seen except by the heart made pure; and [even] he who in this life sees them \"in part,\" as it has been said, and \"in an enigma,\"[fn-32-P3296_1514137:112-nf] cannot secure it that the person to whom he speaks shall also see them, if he is hampered by impurities of heart. \"Blessed,\" however, \"are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-32-P3297_1514347:113-nf] This is the faith on the subject of God our Maker and Renewer.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_117_discourse_ix_tusiane_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"ANF-06","text":"And let these things be said for the sake of example, showing that the Jews have wonderfully fallen from the hope of future good, because they consider things present to be only signs of things already accomplished; whilst they do not perceive that the figures represent images, and images are the representatives of truth.

For, following the Septuagint version, these are the prophet's words: \"Did not my heart go with thee, when the man came out of his chariot to meet thee, and thou tookedst his gifts?\"[fn-45-P4535_2512281:74-nf] Or, as the presbyter Jerome rendered it from the Hebrew, \"Was not my heart present when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee?\" The prophet said that he saw this with his heart, miraculously aided by God, as no one can doubt. But how much more abundantly shall the saints enjoy this gift when God shall be all in all? Nevertheless the bodily eyes also shall have their office and their place, and shall be used by the spirit through the spiritual body. For the prophet did not forego the use of his eyes for seeing what was before them, though he did not need them to see his absent servant, and though he could have seen these present objects in spirit, and with his eyes shut, as he saw things far distant in a place where he himself was not.

Thus the former of these two virtues is occupied with the precepts for the right exercise of the temporal life, whereas the latter deals with the doctrine of that life which is everlasting. In this way, also, the one operates, the other rests; for the former finds its sphere in the purging of sins, the latter moves in the light[fn-10-P1081_421169:32-nf] of the purged. And thus, again, in this mortal life the one is engaged with the work of a good conversation; while the other subsists rather on faith, and is seen only in the person of the very few, and through the glass darkly, and only in part in a kind of vision of the unchangeable truth.[fn-10-P1082_421572:33-nf] Now these two virtues are understood to be presented emblematically in the instance of the two wives of Jacob.

Thou art thus convicted of worshipping gods without number; for thou canst not bear the sound doctrine which teaches that there is one Son of one God, and one Spirit of both. And these, instead of being without number, are not three Gods; for not only is their substance one and the same, but their operation by means of this substance is also one and the same, while they have a separate manifestation in the material creation. These things thou dost not understand, and canst not receive. Thou art full, as thou sayest, for thou art steeped in blasphemous absurdities. Will thou continue burying thyself under such crudities? Sing on, then, and open thine eyes, if thou canst, to thine own shame. In this doctrine of lying devils thou art invited to fabulous dwellings of angels in a happy clime, and to fragrant fields where nectar flows for ever from trees and hills, in seas and rivers. These are the fictions of thy foolish heart, which revels in such idle fancies. Such expressions are sometimes used as figurative descriptions of the abundance of spiritual enjoyments; and they lead the mind of the student to inquire into their hidden meaning. Sometimes there is a material representation to the bodily senses, as the fire in the bush, the rod becoming a serpent, and the serpent a rod, the garment of the Lord not divided by His persecutors, the anointing of His feet or of His head by a devout woman, the branches of the multitude preceding and following Him when riding on the ass. Sometimes, either in sleep or in a trance, the spirit is informed by means of figures taken from material things, as Jacob's ladder, and the stone in Daniel cut out without hands and growing into a mountain, and Peter's vessel, and all that John saw. Sometimes the figures are only in the language; as in the Song of Songs, and in the parable of a householder making a marriage for his son, or that of the prodigal son, or that of the man who planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen. Thou boastest of Manichaeus as having come last, not to use figures, but to explain them.His expositions throw light on ancient types, and leave no problem unsolved. This idea is supported by the assertion that the ancient types, in vision or in action or in words, had in view the coming of Manichaeus, by whom they were all to be explained; while he, knowing that no one is to follow him, makes use of a style free from all figurative expressions. What, then, are those fields, and shady hills, and crowns of flowers, and fragrant odors, in which the desires of thy fleshly mind take pleasure? If they are not significant figures, they are either idle fancies or delirious dreams. If they are figures, away with the impostor who seduces thee with the promise of naked truth, and then mocks thee with idle tales. His ministers and his wretched deluded followers are wont to bait their hook with that saying of the apostle, \"Now we see through a glass in a figure, but then face to face.\"[fn-16-P1633_898779:17-nf] As if, forsooth, the Apostle Paul knew in part, and prophesied in part, and saw through a glass in a figure; whereas all this is removed at the coming of Manichaeus, who brings that which is perfect, and reveals the truth face to face. O fallen and shameless! still to continue uttering such folly, still feeding on the wind, still embracing the idols of thine own heart. Hast thou, then, seen face to face the king with the sceptre, and the crown of flowers, and the hosts of gods, and the great worldholder with six faces and radiant with light, and that other exalted ruler surrounded with troops of angels, and the invincible warrior with a spear in his right hand and a shield in his left, and the famous sovereign who moves the three wheels of fire, water, and wind, and Atlas, chief of all, bearing the world on his shoulders, and supporting himself on his arms? These, and a thousand other marvels, hast thou seen face to face, or are thy songs doctrines learned from lying devils, though thou knowest it not?

Take from it patience; and deprived of it, it does not endure. Take from it the substance of bearing and of enduring, and it continues with no roots nor strength. The apostle, finally, when he would speak of charity, joined to it endurance and patience. \"Charity,\" he says, \"is large-souled; charity is kind; charity envieth not, is not puffed up, is not provoked, thinketh not evil; loveth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-76-P7624_2557637:35-nf] Thence he shows that it can tenaciously persevere, because it knows how to endure all things.

For even if any suppose that he know what I said of Cicero, (although it be no hindrance to him from learning, in that the matter itself is incapable of being grasped by any knowledge;) yet, (in that he understands not that there is a great difference, whether any thing be grasped by sure reason of mind, which we call understanding, or whether for practical purposes it be entrusted to common fame or writing, for posterity to believe it,) he assuredly errs, and no error is without what is base.

The blasphemy of these theorists, which we have had to follow out in every step it takes, has caused us unwittingly to soil our discussion with the mud of their own imaginings. The view which is consistent with all reverence is as follows. We are not to think of the Father as ever parted from the Son, nor to look for the Son as separate from the Holy Spirit. As it is impossible to mount to the Father, unless our thoughts are exalted thither through the Son, so it is impossible also to say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are to be known only in a perfect Trinity, in closest consequence and union with each other, before all creation, before all the ages, before anything whatever of which we can form an idea[fn-24-P2475_1700087:24-nf] . The Father is always Father, and in Him the Son, and with the Son the Holy Spirit. If these Persons, then, are inseparate from each other, how great is the folly of these men who undertake to sunder this indivisibility by certain distinctions of time, and so far to divide the Inseparable as to assert confidently, \"the Father alone, through the Son alone, made all things\"; the Holy Spirit, that is, being not present at all on the occasion of this making, or else not working. Well, if He was not present, they must tell us where He was; and whether, while God embraces all things, they can imagine any separate standing-place for the Spirit, so that He could have remained in isolation during the time occupied by the process of creating. If, on the other hand, He was present, how was it that He was inactive? Because He could not, or because He would not, work? Did He abstain willingly, or because some strong necessity drove Him away? Now, if He deliberately embraced this inactivity, He must reject working in any other possible way either; and He Who affirmed that \"He worketh all things in all, as He wills[fn-24-P2476_1701243:25-nf] ,\" is according to them a liar. If, on the contrary, this Spirit has the impulse to work, but some overwhelming control hinders His design, they must tell us the wherefore of this hindrance. Was it owing to his being grudged a share in the glory of those operations, and in order to secure that the admiration at their success should not extend to a third person as its object; or to a distrust of His help, as if His co-operation would result in present mischief? These clever men most certainly furnish the grounds for our holding one of these two hypotheses; or else, if a grudging spirit has no connection with the Deity, any more than a failure can be conceived of in any relation to an Infallible Being, what meaning of any kind is there in these narrow views of theirs, which isolate the Spirit's power from all world-building efficiency? Their duty rather was to expel their low human way of thinking, by means of loftier ideas, and to make a calculation more worthy of the sublimity of the objects in question. For neither did the Universal God make the universe \"through the Son,\" as needing any help, nor does the Only-begotten God work all things \"by the Holy Spirit,\" as having a power that comes short of His design; but the fountain of power is the Father, and the power of the Father is the Son, and the spirit of that power is the Holy Spirit; and Creation entirely, in all its visible and spiritual extent, is the finished work of that Divine power. And seeing that no toil can be thought of in the composition of anything connected with the Divine Being (for performance being bound to the moment of willing, the Plan at once becomes a Reality), we should be justified in calling all that Nature which came into existence by creation a movement of Will, an impulse of Design, a transmission of Power, beginning from the Father, advancing through the Son, and completed in the Holy Spirit.","title":"On the Holy Spirit, Against the Followers of Macedonius","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":13,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_32_book_i","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"131","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"43.

But who can doubt that this is false? Therefore marriage and fornication are not two evils, whereof the second is worse: but marriage and continence are two goods, whereof the second is better, even as this temporal health and sickness are not two evils, whereof the second is worse; but that health and immortality are two goods, whereof the second is better. Also knowledge and vanity are not two evils, whereof vanity is the worse: but knowledge and charity are two goods, whereof charity is the better.

But as the repasts of the Just are better than the fasts of the sacrilegious, so the marriage of the faithful is to be set before the virginity of the impious. However neither in that case is repast preferred to fasting, but righteousness to sacrilege; nor in this, marriage to virginity, but faith to impiety. For for this end the righteous, when need is, take their repast, that, as good masters, they may give to their slaves, i.e., their bodies, what is just and fair: but for this end the sacrilegious fast, that they may serve devils. Thus for this end the faithful are married, that they may be chastely joined unto husbands, but for this end the impious are virgins, that they may commit fornication away from the true God. As, therefore, that was good, which Martha was doing, being engaged in the ministering unto the Saints, but that better, which Mary, her sister, sitting at the feet of the Lord, and hearing His word; thus we praise the good of Susanna[fn-37-P3773_1784293:25-nf] in married chastity, but yet we set before her the good of the widow Anna,[fn-37-P3774_1784398:26-nf] and, much more, of the Virgin Mary.[fn-37-P3775_1784452:27-nf] It was good that they were doing, who of their substance were ministering necessaries unto Christ and His disciples: but better, who left all their substance, that they might be freer to follow the same Lord. But in both these cases of good, whether what these, or whether what Martha and Mary were doing, the better could not be done, unless the other had been passed over or left. Whence we are to understand, that we are not, on this account, to think marriage an evil, because, unless there be abstinence from it, widowed chastity, or virgin purity, cannot be had. For neither on this account was what Martha was doing evil, because, unless her sister abstained from it, she could not do what was better: nor on this account is it evil to receive a just man or a prophet into one's house, because he, who wills to follow Christ unto perfection, ought not even to have a house, in order to do what is better.","title":"On the Good of Marriage.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"11.

Concerning John, namely, what new thing he learned concerning the Lord by means of the dove, although he had already known the Lord. And this was discovered by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, that John indeed already knew the Lord, but that the Lord Himself was to baptize, that the power of baptizing He would not transfer from Himself to any one, this he learned by means of the dove, because it was said to him, \"On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending as a dove, and abiding upon Him, this is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-5-P505_210647:4-nf] What is \"This is He\"? Not another, although by means of another. But why by means of a dove? Many things were said, and I am not able, nor is there need that I should go over all;-principally, however, to denote peace, because also the trees which were baptized outside, because the dove found in them fruit, it brought to the ark, as you remember the dove sent out by Noah from the ark, which floated on the flood and was washed by baptism, was not submerged.

For the whole of fruit is charity, without which a man is nothing, whatever else he have. And this, which is most fully said by the apostle, we have mentioned and recounted. For he says, \"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal; and though I should have all knowledge, and know all mysteries, and have all prophecy, and should have all faith\" (but in what sense did he say all faith?), \"so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

And forasmuch as sins are committed either by the mind, as in the will only, or by the works of the body also, and so visibly; therefore the Prophet Amos continually introduces[fn-30-P3063_1350668:136-nf] God as threatening, and saying, \"For three and four iniquities I will not turn away,\" that is,\" I will not dissemble My wrath.\"[fn-30-P3064_1350815:137-nf] Three, because of the nature of the soul; four, because of that of the body; of which two, man consists.","title":"Sermon I.

Mark what comes next: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-31-P3177_1395437:13-nf] This is the end of our love; an end whereby we are perfected, and not consumed. For there is an end of food, and an end of agarment; of food when it is consumed by the eating; of a garment when it is perfected in the weaving. Both the one and the other have an end; but the one is an end of consumption, the other of perfection. Whatsoever we now do, whatsoever we now do well, whatsoever we now strive for, or are in laudable sort eager for, or blamelessly desire, when we come to the vision of God, we shall require nomore. For what need he seek for, with whom God is present? or what shall suffice him, whom God sufficeth not? We wish to see God, we seek, we kindle with desire to see Him. Who doth not? But mark what is said: \"Blessedare the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\" Provide thyself then with that whereby thou mayest see Him. For (to speak after the flesh) how with weak eyes desirest thou the rising of the sun? Let the eye be sound, and that light will be a rejoicing, if it be not sound, it will be but a torment. For it is not permitted with aheart impure to see that which is seen only by the pure heart. Thou wilt be repelled, driven hack from it, and wilt not see it. For \"blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\" How often already hath he enumerated the blessed, and the causes of their blessedness, and their works and recompenses, their merits and rewards! But nowhere hath it been said, \"They shall see God.\" \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\" \"Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.\" \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, they shall be filled.\" \"Blessed are the merciful, they shall obtain mercy.\" In none of these hath it been said, \"They shall see God.\" When we come to the \"pure in heart,\" there is the vision of God promised. And not without good cause; for there, in the heart, are the eyes, by which God is seen. Speaking of these eyes, the Apostle Paul saith. \"The eyes of your heart being enlightened.\"[fn-31-P3178_1397549:14-nf] At present then these eyes are enlightened, as is suitable to their infirmity, by faith; hereafter as shall be suited to their strength, they shall be enlightened by sight. \"For as long as we are in the body we are absent from the Lord; For we walk by faith, not by sight.\"[fn-31-P3179_1397840:15-nf] Now as long as we are in this state of faith, what is said of us? \"We see now through a glass darkly; but then face to face.\"[fn-31-P3180_1397987:16-nf] ","title":"Sermon III.

They which say these things, do not understand that as well each one of the wicked is in that measure for endurance of any ills more hard, in what measure the lust of the world is mightier in him; as also that each one of the just is in that measure for endurance of any ills more brave, in what measure in him the love of God is mightier. But lust of the world hath its beginning from choice of the will, its progress from enjoyableness of pleasure, its confirmation from the chain of custom, whereas \"the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts,\"[fn-47-P4773_2353163:35-nf] not verily from ourselves, but\" by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.\" And therefore from Him cometh the patience of the just, by Whom is shed abroad their love (of Him). Which love (of charity) the Apostle praising and setting off, among its other good qualities, saith, that it \"beareth all things.\"[fn-47-P4774_2353487:36-nf] \"Charity,\" saith he, \"is magnanimous.\"[fn-47-P4775_2353550:37-nf] And a little after he saith, \"endureth all things.\" The greater then is in saints the charity (or love) of God, the more do they endure all things for Him whom they love, and the greater in sinners the lust of the world, the more do they endure all things for that which they lust after And consequently from that same source cometh true patience of the righteous, from which there is in them the love of God; and from that same source the false patience of the unrighteous, from which is in them the lust of the world. With regard to which the Apostle John saith; \"Love not the world,neither the things that be in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him: because all that is in the world, is lust of the flesh, and lust of the eyes, and pride of life;[fn-47-P4776_2354354:38-nf] which is not of the Father, but is of the world.\"[fn-47-P4777_2354426:39-nf] This concupiscence, then, which is not of the Father, but is of the world, in what measure it shall in any man be more vehement and ardent, in that measure becometh each more patient of all troubles and sorrows for that which he lusteth after. Therefore, as we said above, this is not the patience which descendeth from above, but the patience of the godly is from above, coming down from the Father of lights. And so that is earthly, this heavenly; that animal, this spiritual; that devilish, this Godlike.[fn-47-P4778_2354958:40-nf] Because concupiscence, whereof it cometh that persons sinning suffer all things stubbornly, is of the world; but charity, whereof cometh that persons living aright suffer all things bravely, is of God. And therefore to that false patience it is possible that, without aid of God, the human will may suffice; harder, in proportion as it is more eager of lust, and bearing ills with the more endurance the worse itself becometh: while to this, which is true patience, the human will, unless aided and inflamed from above, doth not suffice, for the very reason that the Holy Spirit is the fire thereof; by Whom unless it be kindled to love that impassible Good, it is not able to bear the ill which it suffereth.","title":"On Patience","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_38_on_patience","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"22.

Unless then its love be given to us from thence there is no source whence it may be in us.

This good will therefore, that is, a will faithfully subjected to God,[fn-48-P4808_2366854:62-nf] a will set on fire by sanctity of that ardor which is above, a will which loves God and his neighbor for God's sake; whether through love, of which the Apostle Peter makes answer, \"Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee;\"[fn-48-P4809_2367091:63-nf] whether through fear, of which says the Apostle Paul, \"In fear and trembling work out your own salvation;\"[fn-48-P4810_2367217:64-nf] whether through joy, of which he says, \"In hope rejoicing, in tribulation patient;\"[fn-48-P4811_2367320:65-nf] whether through sorrow, with which he says he had great grief for his brethren;[fn-48-P4812_2367419:66-nf] in whatever way it endure what bitterness and hardships soever, it is the love of God which \"endureth all things,\"[fn-48-P4813_2367551:67-nf] and which is not shed abroad in our hearts but by the Holy Spirit given unto us.[fn-48-P4814_2367653:68-nf] Whereof piety makes no manner of doubt, but, as the charity of them which holily love, so the patience of them which piously endure, is the gift of God.

Because it is said with excessive folly, that God is loved as much before He is seen, as He will be loved when He is seen. Further, if in this life, as no religious person doubts, the more we love God, so much the more righteous we certainly are, who can doubt that pious and true righteousness will then be perfected when the love of God shall be perfect? Then the law, therefore, shall be fulfilled; so that nothing at all is wanting to it, of which law, according to the apostle, the fulfilling is Love.

That Thou givest them they gather for themselves; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled with goodness. But when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled: Thou shall take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned into their dust. Thou shall send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth,'[fn-57-P5788_2273696:129-nf] such things as these cannot seem to have been said of any time whatever but of that future time, in which there shall be a new earth and a new heaven. Therefore they shall be disturbed that they may take their beginning. `And when Thou openest Thy hand all things shall be filled with goodness,' which is not easily characteristic of this age. For concerning this age what does Scripture say? `There is none that doeth good, no, not one.'[fn-57-P5789_2274160:130-nf] If, therefore, there are different generations,-and here the very entrance into this life is the receiver of sins to such an extent that even he who begot should be despised; while another generation does not receive sins;-let us consider whether by any means there may not be a regeneration for us after the course of this life,-of which regeneration it is said, `In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory.'[fn-57-P5790_2274623:131-nf] For as that is called the regeneration of washing whereby we are renewed from the filth of sins washed away, so that seems to be called a regeneration by which we are purified from every stain of bodily materiality, and are regenerated in the pure sense of the soul to life eternal; so that every quality of regeneration may be purer than ofthat washing, so that no suspicion of sins can fall either on a man's doings, or even on his very thoughts themselves.\" Moreover, in another place in the same work he says: \"We see it to be impossible that any person created in a body can be absolutely spotless, since even Paul says I that he is imperfect. For thus he has it: `Not that I have already received, or am already perfect;'[fn-57-P5791_2275373:132-nf] and yet after a little he says, 'As many of us, therefore, as are perfect.'[fn-57-P5792_2275471:133-nf] Unless, perchance, there is one perfection in this world, another after this is completed, of which he says to the Corinthians, `When that which is perfect is come;'[fn-57-P5793_2275659:134-nf] and elsewhere, `Till we all come into the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, into the perfect man to the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ.'[fn-57-P5794_2275857:135-nf] As, then, the apostle says that many are placed in this world who are perfect along with him, but who, if you have regard to true perfection, could not be perfect, since he says, `We see now through a mirror, enigmatically; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known:'[fn-57-P5795_2276192:136-nf] so also there both are those who are 'spotless' in this world, and will be those who are 'spotless' in the kingdom of God, although certainly, if you consider it accurately, no person can be spotless, because no person is without sin.\" Also in the same he says: \"We see that, while we live in this life, we ought to purify ourselves and to seek God; and to begin from the purification of our soul, and as it were to establish the foundations of virtue, so that we may deserve to attain the perfection of our purgation after this life.\" And again, in the same he says: \"But laden and groaning, who does not say, `O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'[fn-57-P5796_2276905:137-nf] So with the same teacher we give all varieties of interpretation. For if he is unhappy who recognises himself as involved in the evils of the body, certainly everybody is unhappy; for I should not call that man happy who, being confused with any darkness of his mind, does not know his own condition. That, moreover, has not absurdly come to be understood; for if a man who knows himself is unhappy, assuredly all are wretched, because every one either recognises his weakness by wisdom, or by folly is ignorant of it.\" Moreover, in the treatise \"On the Benefit of Death,\" he says:[fn-57-P5797_2277508:138-nf] \"Let death work in us, in order that that may work life also, a good life after death,-that is, a good life after victory, a good life after the contest is finished; so that now no longer the law of the flesh may know how to resist the law of the mind, that no longer we may have any contention with the body of death.\" Again, in the same treatise he says: \"Therefore, because the righteous have this reward, that they see the face of God, and that light which lightens every man, let us henceforth put on the desire of this kind of reward, that our soul may draw near to God, our prayer may draw near to Him, our desire may cleave, to Him, that we be not separated from Him. And placed here as we are, let us by meditating, by reading, by seeking, be united with God. Let us know Him as we can. For we know Him in part here; because here all things are imperfect, there all are perfect; here we are infants, there we shall be strong men. `We see,' says he, `now through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face.' Then, His face being revealed, we shall be allowed to look upon the glory of God, which now our souls, involved in the compacted dregs of this body, and shadowed by some stains and filth of this flesh, cannot clearly see. `For who,' He says, `shall see my face and live?' and rightly. For if our eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun,-and if any one should gaze too long on the region of the sun he is said to be blinded,-if a creature cannot look upon a creature without deceit and offence, how can he without his own peril look upon the glittering face of the eternal Creator, covered as he is with the clothing of this body?

For concerning this age what does Scripture say? `There is none that doeth good, no, not one.'[fn-57-P5789_2274160:130-nf] If, therefore, there are different generations,-and here the very entrance into this life is the receiver of sins to such an extent that even he who begot should be despised; while another generation does not receive sins;-let us consider whether by any means there may not be a regeneration for us after the course of this life,-of which regeneration it is said, `In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory.'[fn-57-P5790_2274623:131-nf] For as that is called the regeneration of washing whereby we are renewed from the filth of sins washed away, so that seems to be called a regeneration by which we are purified from every stain of bodily materiality, and are regenerated in the pure sense of the soul to life eternal; so that every quality of regeneration may be purer than ofthat washing, so that no suspicion of sins can fall either on a man's doings, or even on his very thoughts themselves.\" Moreover, in another place in the same work he says: \"We see it to be impossible that any person created in a body can be absolutely spotless, since even Paul says I that he is imperfect. For thus he has it: `Not that I have already received, or am already perfect;'[fn-57-P5791_2275373:132-nf] and yet after a little he says, 'As many of us, therefore, as are perfect.'[fn-57-P5792_2275471:133-nf] Unless, perchance, there is one perfection in this world, another after this is completed, of which he says to the Corinthians, `When that which is perfect is come;'[fn-57-P5793_2275659:134-nf] and elsewhere, `Till we all come into the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, into the perfect man to the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ.'[fn-57-P5794_2275857:135-nf] As, then, the apostle says that many are placed in this world who are perfect along with him, but who, if you have regard to true perfection, could not be perfect, since he says, `We see now through a mirror, enigmatically; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known:'[fn-57-P5795_2276192:136-nf] so also there both are those who are 'spotless' in this world, and will be those who are 'spotless' in the kingdom of God, although certainly, if you consider it accurately, no person can be spotless, because no person is without sin.\" Also in the same he says: \"We see that, while we live in this life, we ought to purify ourselves and to seek God; and to begin from the purification of our soul, and as it were to establish the foundations of virtue, so that we may deserve to attain the perfection of our purgation after this life.\" And again, in the same he says: \"But laden and groaning, who does not say, `O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'[fn-57-P5796_2276905:137-nf] So with the same teacher we give all varieties of interpretation. For if he is unhappy who recognises himself as involved in the evils of the body, certainly everybody is unhappy; for I should not call that man happy who, being confused with any darkness of his mind, does not know his own condition. That, moreover, has not absurdly come to be understood; for if a man who knows himself is unhappy, assuredly all are wretched, because every one either recognises his weakness by wisdom, or by folly is ignorant of it.\" Moreover, in the treatise \"On the Benefit of Death,\" he says:[fn-57-P5797_2277508:138-nf] \"Let death work in us, in order that that may work life also, a good life after death,-that is, a good life after victory, a good life after the contest is finished; so that now no longer the law of the flesh may know how to resist the law of the mind, that no longer we may have any contention with the body of death.\" Again, in the same treatise he says: \"Therefore, because the righteous have this reward, that they see the face of God, and that light which lightens every man, let us henceforth put on the desire of this kind of reward, that our soul may draw near to God, our prayer may draw near to Him, our desire may cleave, to Him, that we be not separated from Him. And placed here as we are, let us by meditating, by reading, by seeking, be united with God. Let us know Him as we can. For we know Him in part here; because here all things are imperfect, there all are perfect; here we are infants, there we shall be strong men. `We see,' says he, `now through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face.' Then, His face being revealed, we shall be allowed to look upon the glory of God, which now our souls, involved in the compacted dregs of this body, and shadowed by some stains and filth of this flesh, cannot clearly see. `For who,' He says, `shall see my face and live?' and rightly. For if our eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun,-and if any one should gaze too long on the region of the sun he is said to be blinded,-if a creature cannot look upon a creature without deceit and offence, how can he without his own peril look upon the glittering face of the eternal Creator, covered as he is with the clothing of this body? For who is justified in God's sight, when even the infant of one day cannot be pure from sin, and no one can boast of his integrity and pureness of heart?\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"ANF-10","text":"The words, however, \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,\" etc., may be taken as equivalent to \"I am He of whom the 'voice in the wilderness' is written.\" Then John would be the person crying, and his voice would be that crying in the wilderness, \"Make straight the way of the Lord.\" Heracleon, discussing John and the prophets, says, somewhat slanderously, that \"the Word is the Saviour; the voice, that in the wilderness which John interpreted; the sound is the whole prophetic order.\" To this we may reply by reminding him of the text,[fn-68-P6801_1232070:75-nf] \"If the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle,\" and that which says that though a man have knowledge of mysteries, or have prophecy but wants love, he is a sounding or a tinkling cymbal.[fn-68-P6802_1232313:76-nf] If the prophetic voice be nothing but sound, how does our Lord come to refer us to it as where He says,[fn-68-P6803_1232438:77-nf] \"Search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and these are they which bear witness,\" and[fn-68-P6804_1232568:78-nf] \"If ye believed Moses, ye would believe Me,\" and[fn-68-P6805_1232634:79-nf] \"Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying, This people honours me with their lips\"? I do not know if any one can reasonably admit that the Saviour thus spoke in praise of an uncertain sound, or that there is any preparation to be had from the Scriptures to which we are referred as from the voice of a trumpet, for our war against opposing powers, should their sound give an uncertain voice. If the prophets had not love, and if that is why they were sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal, then how does the Lord send us to their sound, as these writers will have it, as if we could get help from that? He asserts, indeed, that a voice, when well fitted to speech, becomes speech, as if one should say that a woman is turned into a man; and the assertion is not supported by argument. And, as if he were in a position to put forth a dogma on the subject and to get on in this way, he declares that sound can be changed in a similar way into voice, and the voice, which is changed into speech, he says, is in the position of a disciple, while sound passing into voice is in that of a slave. If he had taken any kind of trouble to establish these points we should have had to devote some attention to refuting them; but as it is, the bare denial is sufficient refutation. There was a point some way back which we deferred taking up, that, namely, of the motive of John's speeches. We may now take it up. The Saviour, according to Heracleon, calls him both a prophet and Elijah, but he himself denies that he is either of these. When the Saviour, Heracleon says, calls him a prophet and Elijah, He is speaking not of John himself, but of his surroundings; but when He calls him greater than the prophets and than those who are born of women, then He is describing the character of John himself. When John, on the other hand, is asked about himself, his answers relate to himself, not to his surroundings. This we have examined as carefully as possible, comparing each of the terms in question with the statements of Heracleon, lest he should not have expressed himself quite accurately. For how it comes that the statements that he is Elijah and that he is a prophet apply to those about him, but the statement that he is the voice of one crying in the wilderness, to himself, no attempt whatever is made to show Heracleon only gives an illustration, namely, this: His surroundings were, so to speak, his clothes, and other than himself, and when he was asked about his clothes, if he; were his clothes, he could not answer \"Yes.\" Now that his being Elijah, who was to come, was his clothes, is scarcely consistent, so far as I can see, with Heracleon's views; it might consist, perhaps, with the exposition we ourselves gave of the words, \"In the spirit and power of Elijah; \"it might, in a sense, be said that this spirit of Elijah is equivalent to the soul of John. He then goes on to try to determine why those who were sent by the Jews to question John were priests and levites, and he answers by no means badly, that it was incumbent on such persons, being devoted to the service of God, to busy themselves and to make enquiries about such matters. When he goes on, however, to say that it was \"because John was of the levitical tribe, this is less well considered. We raised the question ourselves above, and saw that if the Jews who were sent knew John's birth, it was not open to them to ask if he was Elijah. Then, again, in dealing with the question, \"Art thou the prophet? \"Heracleon does not regard the addition of the article as having any special force, and says, \"They asked him if he were a prophet, wishing to know this more general fact.\" Again, not Heracleon alone, but, so far as I am informed, all those who diverge from our views, as if they had not been able to deal with a trifling ambiguity and to draw the proper distinction, suppose John to be greater than Elijah and than all the prophets. The words are, \"Of those born of women there is none greater than John; \"but this admits of two mean-lugs, that John is greater than they all, or again, that some of them are equal to him. For though many of the prophets were equal to him, still it might be true ill respect of the grace bestowed on him, that none of them was greater than he. He regards it as confirming the view that John was greater, that \"he is predicted by Isaiah; \"for no other of all those who uttered prophecies was held worthy by God of this distinction. This, however, is a venturesome statement anti implies some disrespect of what is called the Old Testament, and total disregard of the fact that Elijah himself was the subject of prophecy. For Elijah is prophesied by Malachi, who says,[fn-68-P6806_1237356:80-nf] \"Behold, I send unto you Elijah, the Tishbite, who shall restore the heart of the father to the son.\" Josiah, too, as we read in third Kings,[fn-68-P6807_1237513:81-nf] was predicted by name by the prophet who came out of Judah; for he said, Jeroboam also being present at the altar, \"Thus saith the Lord, Behold a son is born to David, his name is Josiah.\" There are some also who say that Samson was predicted by Jacob, when he said,[fn-68-P6808_1237802:82-nf] \"Dan shall judge his own people, he is as one tribe in Israel,\" for Samson who judged Israel was of the tribe of Dan.

Sometimes his aim has been to destroy the truth by defending it. He maintains that there is one only Lord, the Almighty Creator of the world, in order that out of this doctrine of the unity he may fabricate a heresy. He says that the Father Himself came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself Jesus Christ. Here the old serpent has fallen out with himself, since, when he tempted Christ after John's baptism, he approached Him as \"the Son of God; \"surely intimating that God had a Son, even on the testimony of the very Scriptures, out of which he was at the moment forging his temptation: \"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-103-P10383_2908627:3-nf] Again: \"If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;[fn-103-P10384_2908708:4-nf] for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning thee\"-referring no doubt, to the Father-\"and in their hands they shall bear thee up, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.\"[fn-103-P10385_2908912:5-nf] Or perhaps, after all, he was only reproaching the Gospels with a lie, saying in fact: \"Away with Matthew; away with Luke! Why heed their words? In spite of them, I declare that it was God Himself that I approached; it was the Almighty Himself that I tempted face to face; and it was for no other purpose than to tempt Him that I approached Him. If, on the contrary, it had been only the Son of God, most likely I should never have condescended to deal with Him.\" However, he is himself a liar from the beginning,[fn-103-P10386_2909442:6-nf] and whatever man he instigates in his own way; as, for instance, Praxeas. For he was the first to import into Rome from Asia this kind of heretical pravity, a man in other respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the pride of confessorship simply and solely because he had to bear for a short time the annoyance of a prison; on which occasion, even \"if he had given his body to be burned, it would have profiled him nothing,\" not having the love of God,[fn-103-P10387_2909935:7-nf] whose very gifts he has resisted and destroyed. For after the Bishop of Rome[fn-103-P10388_2910031:8-nf] had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace[fn-103-P10389_2910208:9-nf] on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, he, by importunately urging false accusations against the prophets themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority of the bishop's predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the pacific letter which he had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the said gifts. By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father. Praxeas' tares had been moreover sown, and had produced their fruit here also,[fn-103-P10390_2910837:10-nf] while many were asleep in their simplicity of doctrine; but these tares actually seemed to have been plucked up, having been discovered and exposed by him whose agency God was pleased to employ. Indeed, Praxeas had deliberately resumed his old (true) faith, teaching it after his renunciation of error; and there is his own handwriting in evidence remaining among the carnally-minded,[fn-103-P10391_2911565:11-nf] in whose society the transaction then took place; afterwards nothing was heard of him. We indeed, on our part, subsequently withdrew from the carnally-minded on our acknowledgment and maintenance of the Paraclete.[fn-103-P10392_2911857:12-nf] But the tares of Praxeas had then everywhere shaken out their seed, which having lain hid for some while, with its vitality concealed under a mask, has now broken out with fresh life. But again shall it be rooted up, if the Lord will, even now; but if not now, in the day when all bundles of tares shall be gathered together, and along with every other stumbling-block shall be burnt up with unquenchable fire.[fn-103-P10393_2912610:13-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Moreover, there comes to our aid, when we insist upon the Father and the Son as being Two, that regulating principle which has determined God to be invisible. When Moses in Egypt desired to see the face of the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself unto me, that I may see Thee and know Thee,\"[fn-105-P10573_2968798:154-nf] God said, \"Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live: \"[fn-105-P10574_2968903:155-nf] in other words, he who sees me shall die. Now we find that God has been seen by many persons, and yet that no one who saw Him died (at the sight). The truth is, they saw God according to the faculties of men, but not in accordance with the full glory of the Godhead. For the patriarchs are said to have seen God (as Abraham and Jacob), and the prophets (as, for instance Isaiah and Ezekiel), and yet they did not die. Either, then, they ought to have died, since they had seen Him-for (the sentence runs), \"No man shall see God, and live ; \"or else if they saw God, and yet did not die, the Scripture is false in stating that God said, \"If a man see my face, he shall not live.\" Either way, the Scripture misleads us, when it makes God invisible, and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must be a different Being who was seen, because of one who was seen it could not be predicated that He is invisible. It will therefore follow, that by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fulness of His majesty, while we recognise the Son as visible by reason of the dispensation of His derived existence;[fn-105-P10575_2970046:156-nf] even as it is not permitted us to contemplate, the sun, in the full amount of his substance which is in the heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray, by reason of the tempered condition of this portion which is projected from him to the earth. Here some one on the other side may be disposed to contend that the Son is also invisible as being the Word, and as being also the Spirit;[fn-105-P10576_2970472:157-nf] and, while claiming one nature for the Father and the Son, to affirm that the Father is rather One and the Same Person with the Son. But the Scripture, as we have said, maintains their difference by the distinction it makes between the Visible and the Invisible. They then go on to argue to this effect, that if it was the Son who then spake to Moses, He must mean it of Himself that His face was visible to no one, because He was Himself indeed the invisible Father in the name of the Son. And by this means they will have it that the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same, just as the Father and the Son are the same; (and this they maintain) because in a preceding passage, before He had refused (the sight of) His face to Moses, the Scripture informs us that \"the Lord spake face to face with Moses, even as a man speaketh unto his friend; \"[fn-105-P10577_2971380:158-nf] just as Jacob also says, \"I have seen God face to face.\"[fn-105-P10578_2971460:159-nf] Therefore the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same; and both being thus the same, it follows that He is invisible as the Father, and visible as the Son. As if the Scripture, according to our exposition of it, were inapplicable to the Son, when the Father is set aside in His own invisibility. We declare, however, that the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is invisible, in that He is God, and the Word and Spirit of God; but that He was visible before the days of His flesh, in the way that He says to Aaron and Miriam, \"And if there shall be a prophet amongst you, I will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream; not as with Moses, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, that is to say, in truth, and not enigmatically\" that is to say, in image;[fn-105-P10579_2972302:160-nf] as the apostle also expresses it, \"Now we see through a glass, darkly (or enigmatically), but then face to face.\"[fn-105-P10580_2972438:161-nf] Since, therefore, He reserves to some future time His presence and speech face to face with Moses-a promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount (of transfiguration), when as we read in the Gospel,\" Moses appeared talking with Jesus\"[fn-105-P10581_2972721:162-nf] -it is evident that in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were, )and an enigma, in vision and dream, that God, I mean the Son of God, appeared-to the prophets and the patriarchs, as also to Moses indeed himself. And even if the Lord did possibly[fn-105-P10582_2973011:163-nf] speak with him face to face, yet it was not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a glass, (as it were, ) and by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spake with Moses, that Moses actually discerned His face, eye to eye,[fn-105-P10583_2973267:164-nf] how comes it to pass that immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he desires to see His face,[fn-105-P10584_2973391:165-nf] which he ought not to have desired, because he had already seen it? And how, in like manner, does the Lord also Say that His face cannot be seen, because He had shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose.) Or what is that fade of God, the sight of which is refused, if there was one which was visible to man? \"I have seen God,\" says Jacob, \"face to face, and my life is preserved.\"[fn-105-P10585_2973840:166-nf] There ought to be some other face which kills if it be only seen. Well, then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not,[fn-105-P10586_2973973:167-nf] ) although He was the face of God, except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because the Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form. But, (they say, ) He calls the invisible Father His face. For who is the Father? Must He not be the face of the Son, by reason of that authority which He obtains as the begotten of the Father? For is there not a natural propriety in saying of some personage greater (than yourself), That man is my face; he gives me his countenance? \"My Father,\"says Christ, \"is greater than I.\"[fn-105-P10587_2974560:168-nf] Therefore the Father must be the face of the Son. For what does the Scripture say? \"The Spirit of His person is Christ the Lord.\"[fn-105-P10588_2974711:169-nf] As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father's person, there is good reason why, in virtue indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose person He belonged-that is to say, the Father-pronounced Him to be His \"face.\" Now this, to be sure, is an astonishing thing, that the Father can be taken to be the face of the Son, when He is His head; for \"the head of Christ is God.\"[fn-105-P10589_2975553:170-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":13,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"123","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This charity, that is, this will glowing with intensest love, the apostle eulogizes with these words: \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?

The true faith, however, and sound doctrine declare that both graces are from God; the Scripture says, \"From His face cometh knowledge and understanding;\"[fn-62-P6238_2401766:236-nf] and another Scripture says, \"Love is of God.\"[fn-62-P6239_2401832:237-nf] We read of \"the Spirit of wisdom and understanding.\"[fn-62-P6240_2401906:238-nf] Also of \"the Spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind?[fn-62-P6241_2401989:239-nf] But love is a greater gift than knowledge; for whenever a man has the gift of knowledge, love is necessary by the side of it, that he be not puffed up.

But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\"[fn-78-P7867_1667783:42-nf] And though He had not laid bare the interpretation, but still continued to use metaphorical language, the disciples would have understood that the discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called leaven, which the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. So long, then, as we have Jesus with us fulfilling the promise which runs, \"Lo, I am with you always unto the consummation of the age,\"[fn-78-P7868_1668211:43-nf] we cannot fast nor be in want of food, so that, because of want of it we should desire to take and eat the forbidden leaven, even from the Pharisees and Sadducees. Now there may sometimes be a time, when He is with us, that we are without food, as is spoken of in the passage above, \"They continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat; \"[fn-78-P7869_1668582:44-nf] but, even though this should happen, being unwilling to send us away fasting lest we faint on the way, He gives thanks over the loaves which were with the disciples, and causes us to have the seven baskets over from the seven loaves, as we have recorded. And moreover this also is to be observed, in view of those who think that the divinity of the Saviour is not at all demonstrable from the Gospel of Matthew, that the fact that, when the disciples were reasoning among themselves and saying, \"We have no loaves,\" Jesus knew their reasonings and said, \"Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves,\"[fn-78-P7870_1669239:45-nf] was beyond the power of man; for the Lord alone, as Solomon says in the third Book of Kings, knows the hearts of men.[fn-78-P7871_1669376:46-nf] But since the disciples understood, when Jesus said, \"Beware of the leaven,\"[fn-78-P7872_1669475:47-nf] that He did not tell them to beware of the loaves but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you will understand that whenever leaven is named it is put figuratively for teaching, whether in the law, or in the Scriptures which come after the law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not right that prayers should take the form of teaching, but should only be supplications of good things from God. But one might inquire, on account of what has been said about disciples who came to the other side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as one of little faith, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what was done by Jesus. But it is not difficult, I think, to say to this, that in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of which \"that which is in part shall be done away,\"[fn-78-P7873_1670341:48-nf] all our faith here is little faith, and in regard to that, we who know in part do not yet know nor remember; for we are not able to obtain a memory which is sufficient and able to attain to the magnitude of the nature of the speculations.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":13,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Next we must inquire how He said to Peter, \"Thou art a stumbling-block unto Me,\"[fn-80-P8033_1715679:157-nf] especially when David says, \"Great peace have they that love Thy law, and there is no stumbling-block to them.\"[fn-80-P8034_1715813:158-nf] For some one will say, if this is said in the prophet, because of the steadfastness of those who have love, and are incapable of being offended, for \"love beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things, love never faileth,\"[fn-80-P8035_1716093:159-nf] how did the Lord Himself, \"who upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all that be bowed down,\"[fn-80-P8036_1716215:160-nf] say to Peter, \"Thou art a stumbling-block unto Me\"?

The speculative and critical faculty is the property of the soul's godlike part; for it is by these that we grasp the Deity also. If, then whether by forethought here, or by purgation hereafter, our soul becomes free from any emotional connection with the brute creation, there will be nothing to impede its contemplation of the Beautiful; for this last is essentially capable of attracting in a certain way every being that looks towards it. If, then, the soul is purified of every vice, it will most certainly be in the sphere of Beauty. The Deity is in very substance Beautiful; and to the Deity the soul will in its state of purity have affinity, and will embrace It as like itself. Whenever this happens, then, there will be no longer need of the impulse of Desire to lead the way to the Beautiful. Whoever passes his time in darkness, he it is who will be under the influence of a desire for the light; but whenever he comes into the light, then enjoyment takes the place of desire, and the power to enjoy renders desire useless and out of date. It will therefore be no detriment to our participation in the Good, that the soul should be free from such emotions, and turning back upon herself should know herself accurately what her actual nature is, and should behold the Original Beauty reflected in the mirror and in the figure of her own beauty. For truly herein consists the real assimilation to the Divine; viz. in making our own life in some degree a copy of the Supreme Being. For a Nature like that, which transcends all thought and is far removed from all that we observe within ourselves, proceeds in its existence in a very different manner to what we do in this present life. Man, possessing a constitution whose law it is to be moving, is carried in that particular direction whither the impulse of his will directs: and so his soul is not affected in the same way towards what lies before it[fn-36-P3670_2370529:89-nf] , as one may say, as to what it has left behind; for hope leads the forward movement, but it is memory that succeeds that movement when it has advanced to the attainment of the hope; and if it is to something intrinsically good that hope thus leads on the soul, the print that this exercise of the will leaves upon the memory is a bright one; but if hope has seduced the soul with some phantom only of the Good, and the excellent Way has been missed, then the memory that succeeds what has happened becomes shame, and an intestine war is thus waged in the soul between memory and hope, because the last has been such a bad leader of the will. Such in fact is the state of mind that shame gives expression to; the soul is stung as it were at the result; its remorse for its ill-considered attempt is a whip that makes it feel to the quick, and it would bring in oblivion to its aid against its tormentor. Now in our case nature, owing to its being indigent of the Good, is aiming always at this which is still wanting to it, and this aiming at a still missing thing is this very habit of Desire, which our constitution displays equally, whether it is baulked of the real Good, or wins that which it is good to win. But a nature that surpasses every idea that we can form of the Good and transcends all other power, being in no want of anything that can be regarded as good, is itself the plenitude of every good; it does not move in the sphere of the good by way of participation in it only, but if is itself the substance of the Good (whatever we imagine the Good to be); it neither gives scope for any rising hope (for hope manifests activity in the direction of something absent; but \"what a man has, why doth he yet hope for?\" as the Apostle asks), nor is it in want of the activity of the memory for the knowledge450of things; that which is actually seen has no need of being remembered. Since, then, this Divine nature is beyond any particular good[fn-36-P3671_2372513:90-nf] , and to the good the good is an object of love, it follows that when It looks within Itself[fn-36-P3672_2372746:91-nf] , It wishes for what It contains and contains that which It wishes, and admits nothing external. Indeed there is nothing external to It, with the sole exception of evil, which, strange as it may seem to say, possesses an existence in not existing at all. For there is no other origin of evil except the negation of the existent, and the truly-existent forms the substance of the Good. That therefore which is not to be found in the existent must be in the non-existent. Whenever the soul, then, having divested itself of the multifarious emotions incident to its nature, gets its Divine form and, mounting above Desire, enters within that towards which it was once incited by that Desire, it offers no harbour within itself either for hope or for memory. It holds the object of the one; the other is extruded from the consciousness by the occupation in enjoying all that is good: and thus the soul copies the life that is above, and is conformed to the peculiar features of the Divine nature; none of its habits are left to it except that of love, which clings by natural affinity to the Beautiful. For this is what love is; the inherent affection towards a chosen object. When, then, the soul, having become simple and single in form and so perfectly godlike, finds that perfectly simple and immaterial good which is really worth enthusiasm and love[fn-36-P3673_2374210:92-nf] , it attaches itself to it and blends with it by means of the movement and activity of love, fashioning itself according to that which it is continually finding and grasping. Becoming by this assimilation to the Good all that the nature of that which it participates is, the soul will consequently, owing to there being no lack of any good in that thing itself which it participates,be itself also in no lack of anything, and so will expel from within the activity and the habit of Desire; for this arises only when the thing missed is not found. For this teaching we have the authority of God's own Apostle, who announces a subduing[fn-36-P3674_2374889:93-nf] and a ceasing of all other activities, even for the good, which are within us, and finds no limit for love alone. Prophecies, he says,shall fail; forms of knowledge shall cease; but \"charity never faileth;\" which is equivalent to its being always as it is: and though[fn-36-P3675_2375197:94-nf] he says that faith and hope have endured so far by the side of love, yet again he prolongs its date beyond theirs, and with good reason too; for hope is in operation only so long as the enjoyment of the things hoped for is not to be had; and faith in the same way is a support[fn-36-P3676_2375745:95-nf] in the uncertainty about the things hoped for; for so he defines it-\"the substance[fn-36-P3677_2375842:96-nf] of things hoped for\"; but when the thing hoped for actually comes, then all other faculties are reduced to quiescence[fn-36-P3678_2375987:97-nf] , and love alone remains active, finding nothing to succeed itself. Love, therefore, is the foremost of all excellent achievements and the first of the commandments of the law. If ever, then, the soul reach this goal, it will be in no needof anything else; it will embrace that plenitude of things which are, whereby alone[fn-36-P3679_2376714:98-nf] it seems in any way to preserve within itself the stamp of God's actual blessedness. For the life of the Supreme Being is love, seeing that the Beautiful is necessarily lovable to those who recognize it, and the Deity does recognize it, and so this recognition becomes love, that which He recognizes being essentially beautiful. This True Beauty the insolence of satiety cannot touch[fn-36-P3680_2377180:99-nf] ; and no satiety interrupting this continuous capacity to love the Beautiful, God's life will have its activity in love; which life is thus in itself beautiful, and is essentially of a loving disposition towards the Beautiful, and receives no check to this activity of love. In fact, in the Beautiful no limit is to be found so that love should have to cease with any limit of the Beautiful. This last can be ended only by its opposite; but when you have a good, as here, which is in its essence incapable of a change for the worse, then that good will go on unchecked into infinity. Moreover, as every being is capable of attracting its like, and humanity is, in a way, like God, as bearing within itself some resemblances to its Prototype, the soul is by a strict necessity attracted to the kindred Deity. In fact what belongs to God must by all means and at any cost be preserved for Him. If, then, on the one hand, the soul is unencumbered with superfluities and no trouble connected with the body presses it down, its advance towards Him Who draws it to Himself is sweet and congenial. But suppose[fn-36-P3681_2379044:100-nf] , on the other hand, that it has been transfixed with the nails of propension[fn-36-P3682_2379278:101-nf] so as to be held down to a habit connected with material things,-a case like that of those in the ruins caused by earthquakes, whose bodies are crushed by the mounds of rubbish; and let us imagine by way of illustration that these are not only pressed down by the weight of the ruins, but have been pierced as well with some spikes and splinters discovered with them in the rubbish. What then, would naturally be the plight of those bodies, when they were being dragged by relatives from the ruins to receive the holy rites of burial, mangled and torn entirely, disfigured in the most direful manner conceivable, with the nails beneath the heap harrowing them by the very violence necessary to pull them out?-Such I think is the plight of the soul as well when the Divine force, for God's very love of man, drags that which belongs to Him from the ruins of the irrational and material. Not in hatred or revenge for a wicked life, to my thinking, does God bring upon sinners those painful dispensations; He is only claiming and drawing to Himself whatever, to please Him, came into existence. But while He for a noble end is attracting the soul to Himself, the Fountain of all Blessedness, it is the occasion necessarily to the being so attracted of a state of torture. Just as those who refine gold from the dross which it contains not only get this base alloy to melt in the fire, but are obliged to melt the pure gold along with the alloy, and then while this last is being consumed the gold remains, so, while evil is being consumed in the purgatorial[fn-36-P3683_2381159:102-nf] fire, the soul that is welded to this evil must inevitably be in the fire too, until the spurious material alloy is consumed and annihilated by this fire. If a clay of the more tenacious kind is deeply plastered round a rope, and then the end of the rope is put through a narrow hole, and then some one on the further side violently pulls it by that end, the result must be that, while the rope itself obeys the force exerted, the clay that has been plastered upon it is scraped off it with this violent pulling and is left outside the hole, and, moreover, is the cause why the rope does not run easily through the passage, but has to undergo a violent tension at the hands of the puller. In such a manner, I think, we may figure to ourselves the agonized struggle of that soul which has wrapped itself up in earthy material passions, when God is drawing it, His own one, to Himself, and the foreign matter, which has somehow grown into its substance, has to be scraped from it by main force, and so occasions it that keen intolerable anguish.","title":"On the Soul and the Resurrection","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":13,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_37_on_the_soul_and_the_resurrection","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"To that objection, she replied, we answer this.

For this teaching we have the authority of God's own Apostle, who announces a subduing[fn-36-P3674_2374889:93-nf] and a ceasing of all other activities, even for the good, which are within us, and finds no limit for love alone. Prophecies, he says,shall fail; forms of knowledge shall cease; but \"charity never faileth;\" which is equivalent to its being always as it is: and though[fn-36-P3675_2375197:94-nf] he says that faith and hope have endured so far by the side of love, yet again he prolongs its date beyond theirs, and with good reason too; for hope is in operation only so long as the enjoyment of the things hoped for is not to be had; and faith in the same way is a support[fn-36-P3676_2375745:95-nf] in the uncertainty about the things hoped for; for so he defines it-\"the substance[fn-36-P3677_2375842:96-nf] of things hoped for\"; but when the thing hoped for actually comes, then all other faculties are reduced to quiescence[fn-36-P3678_2375987:97-nf] , and love alone remains active, finding nothing to succeed itself. Love, therefore, is the foremost of all excellent achievements and the first of the commandments of the law. If ever, then, the soul reach this goal, it will be in no needof anything else; it will embrace that plenitude of things which are, whereby alone[fn-36-P3679_2376714:98-nf] it seems in any way to preserve within itself the stamp of God's actual blessedness. For the life of the Supreme Being is love, seeing that the Beautiful is necessarily lovable to those who recognize it, and the Deity does recognize it, and so this recognition becomes love, that which He recognizes being essentially beautiful. This True Beauty the insolence of satiety cannot touch[fn-36-P3680_2377180:99-nf] ; and no satiety interrupting this continuous capacity to love the Beautiful, God's life will have its activity in love; which life is thus in itself beautiful, and is essentially of a loving disposition towards the Beautiful, and receives no check to this activity of love. In fact, in the Beautiful no limit is to be found so that love should have to cease with any limit of the Beautiful. This last can be ended only by its opposite; but when you have a good, as here, which is in its essence incapable of a change for the worse, then that good will go on unchecked into infinity. Moreover, as every being is capable of attracting its like, and humanity is, in a way, like God, as bearing within itself some resemblances to its Prototype, the soul is by a strict necessity attracted to the kindred Deity. In fact what belongs to God must by all means and at any cost be preserved for Him. If, then, on the one hand, the soul is unencumbered with superfluities and no trouble connected with the body presses it down, its advance towards Him Who draws it to Himself is sweet and congenial. But suppose[fn-36-P3681_2379044:100-nf] , on the other hand, that it has been transfixed with the nails of propension[fn-36-P3682_2379278:101-nf] so as to be held down to a habit connected with material things,-a case like that of those in the ruins caused by earthquakes, whose bodies are crushed by the mounds of rubbish; and let us imagine by way of illustration that these are not only pressed down by the weight of the ruins, but have been pierced as well with some spikes and splinters discovered with them in the rubbish. What then, would naturally be the plight of those bodies, when they were being dragged by relatives from the ruins to receive the holy rites of burial, mangled and torn entirely, disfigured in the most direful manner conceivable, with the nails beneath the heap harrowing them by the very violence necessary to pull them out?-Such I think is the plight of the soul as well when the Divine force, for God's very love of man, drags that which belongs to Him from the ruins of the irrational and material. Not in hatred or revenge for a wicked life, to my thinking, does God bring upon sinners those painful dispensations; He is only claiming and drawing to Himself whatever, to please Him, came into existence. But while He for a noble end is attracting the soul to Himself, the Fountain of all Blessedness, it is the occasion necessarily to the being so attracted of a state of torture. Just as those who refine gold from the dross which it contains not only get this base alloy to melt in the fire, but are obliged to melt the pure gold along with the alloy, and then while this last is being consumed the gold remains, so, while evil is being consumed in the purgatorial[fn-36-P3683_2381159:102-nf] fire, the soul that is welded to this evil must inevitably be in the fire too, until the spurious material alloy is consumed and annihilated by this fire. If a clay of the more tenacious kind is deeply plastered round a rope, and then the end of the rope is put through a narrow hole, and then some one on the further side violently pulls it by that end, the result must be that, while the rope itself obeys the force exerted, the clay that has been plastered upon it is scraped off it with this violent pulling and is left outside the hole, and, moreover, is the cause why the rope does not run easily through the passage, but has to undergo a violent tension at the hands of the puller. In such a manner, I think, we may figure to ourselves the agonized struggle of that soul which has wrapped itself up in earthy material passions, when God is drawing it, His own one, to Himself, and the foreign matter, which has somehow grown into its substance, has to be scraped from it by main force, and so occasions it that keen intolerable anguish.","title":"On the Soul and the Resurrection","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_37_oration_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"4.

Further, what is said in the promise of the Paraclete shows that it cannot possibly refer to Manichaeus, who came so many years after. For it is distinctly said by John, that the Holy Spirit was to come immediately after the resurrection and ascension of the Lord: \"For the Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\"[fn-25-P2515_1521599:33-nf] Now, if the reason why the Spirit was not given was, that Jesus was not glorified, He would necessarily be given immediately on the glorification of Jesus. In the same way, the Cataphrygians[fn-25-P2516_1521809:34-nf] said that they had received the promised Paraclete; and so they fell away from the Catholic faith, forbidding what Paul allowed, and condemning second marriages, which he made lawful. They turned to their own use the words spoken of the Spirit, \"He shall lead you into all truth,\" as if, forsooth, Paul and the other apostles had not taught all the truth, but had left room for the Paraclete of the Cataphrygians. The same meaning they forced from the words of Paul: \"We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away;\"[fn-25-P2517_1522526:35-nf] making out that the apostle knew and prophesied in part, when he said, \"Let him do what he will; if he marries, he sinneth not,\"[fn-25-P2518_1522680:36-nf] and that this is done away by the perfection of the Phrygian Paraclete.[fn-25-P2519_1522773:37-nf] And if they are told that they are condemned by the authority of the Church, which is the subject of such ancient promises, and is spread all over the world, they reply that this is in exact fulfillment of what is said of the Paraclete, that the world cannot receive Him.[fn-25-P2520_1523060:38-nf] And are not those passages, \"He shall lead you into all truth,\" and, \"When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away,\" and, \"The world cannot receive Him,\" precisely those in which you find a prediction of Manichaeus? And so every heresy arising under the name of the Paraclete will have the boldness to make an equally plausible application to itself of such texts. For there is no heresy but will call itself the truth; and the prouder it is, the more likely it will be to call itself perfect truth: and so it will profess to lead into all truth; and since that which is perfect has come by it, it will try to do away with the doctrine of the apostles, to which its own errors are opposed. And as the Church holds by the earnest admonition of the apostle, that \"whoever preaches another gospel to you than that which ye have received, let him be accursed;\"[fn-25-P2521_1523968:39-nf] when the heretical preacher begins to be pronounced accursed by all the world, will he not forthwith exclaim, This is what is written, \"The world cannot receive Him\"?","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_45_book_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"18. Where, then, will you find the proof required to show that it is from the Paraclete that you have learned that the Gospels were not written by the apostles? On the other hand, we have proof that the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, came immediately after the glorification of Jesus. For \"He was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" We have proof also that He leads into all truth, for the only way to truth is by love, and \"the love of God,\" says the apostle, \"is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given unto us.\"[fn-25-P2523_1524701:40-nf] We show, too, that in the words, \"when that which is perfect is come,\" Paul spoke of the perfection in the enjoyment of eternal life. For in the same place he says: \"Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face.\"[fn-25-P2524_1524942:41-nf] You cannot reasonably maintain that we see God face to face here. Therefore that which is perfect has not come to you. It is thus clear what the apostle thought on this subject.

This is the eternal adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the eternal light, since like loves like; and that which is holy, loves that from which holiness proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light. \"Once ye were darkness, now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-33-P3386_1015287:56-nf] Hence I am of opinion man was called by the ancientsfw/j.[fn-33-P3387_1015361:57-nf] But he has not yet received, say they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is in the light, and the darkness comprehendeth him not. There is nothing intermediate between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till the resurrection of those who believe; and it is not the reception of some other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For we do not say that both take place together at the same time-both the arrival at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For eternity and time are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result; but both have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person is concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in time; the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for eternity. Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality of salvation, when He said: \"For this is the will of my Father, that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.\"[fn-33-P3388_1016450:58-nf] As far as possible in this world, which is what he means by the last day, and which is preserved till the time that it shall end, we believe that we are made perfect. Wherefore He says, \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.\"[fn-33-P3389_1016708:59-nf] If, then, those who have believed have life, what remains beyond the possession of eternal life? Nothing is wanting to faith, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If aught is wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But faith is not lame in any respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who have believed, and received without distinction the earnest of future good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by faith that which is future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that that may be fulfilled which was spoken, \"Be it according to thy faith.\"[fn-33-P3390_1017328:60-nf] And where faith is, there is the promise; and the consummation of the promise is rest. So that in illumination what we receive is knowledge, and the end of knowledge is rest-the last thing conceived as the object of aspiration. As, then, inexperience comes to an end by experience, and perplexity by finding a clear outlet, so by illumination must darkness disappear. The darkness is ignorance, through which we fall into sins, purblind as to the truth. Knowledge, then, is the illumination we receive, which makes ignorance disappear, and endows us with clear vision. Further, the abandonment of what is bad is the adopting[fn-33-P3391_1017972:61-nf] of what is better. For what ignorance has bound ill, is by knowledge loosed well; those bonds are with all speed slackened by human faith and divine grace, our transgressions being taken away by one Poeonian[fn-33-P3392_1018257:62-nf] medicine, the baptism of the Word. We are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil. This is the one grace of illumination, that our characters are not the same as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear, we who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the Holy Spirit. For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity, and that there is the same equality before the righteous and loving God, and the same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most clearly showed, speaking to the following effect: \"Before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed, so that the law became our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-33-P3393_1019327:63-nf] Do you not hear that we are no longer under that law which was accompanied with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: \"For ye are all the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-33-P3394_1020084:64-nf] There are not, then, in the same Word some \"illuminated (gnostics); and some animal (or natural) men; \"but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: \"For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup.\"[fn-33-P3395_1020475:65-nf] Nor were it absurd to employ the expressions of those who call the reminiscence of better things the filtration of the spirit, understanding by filtration the separation of what is baser, that results from the reminiscence of what is better. There follows of necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of what is better, repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess that the spirit in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way, therefore, we also, repenting of our sins, renouncing our iniquities, purified by baptism, speed back to the eternal light, children to the Father. Jesus therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: \"I thank Thee, O Father, God of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; \"[fn-33-P3396_1021288:66-nf] the Master and Teacher applying the name babes to us, who are readier to embrace salvation than the wise in the world, who, thinking themselves wise, are inflated with pride. And He exclaims in exultation and exceeding joy, as if lisping with the children, \"Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\"[fn-33-P3397_1021617:67-nf] Wherefore those things which have been concealed from the wise and prudent of this present world have been revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of God, who have put aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of wickedness, and put on the immortality of Christ; that we may become a new, holy people by regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as God's little one,[fn-33-P3398_1022035:68-nf] is cleansed from fornication and wickedness. With the greatest clearness the blessed Paul has solved for us this question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, writing thus: \"Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be children, but in understanding be men.\"[fn-33-P3399_1022507:69-nf] And the expression, \"When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spoke as a child,\"[fn-34-P3400_1022612:70-nf] points out his mode of life according to the law, according to which, thinking childish things, he persecuted, and speaking childish things he blasphemed the Word, not as having yet attained to the simplicity of childhood, but as being in its folly; for the wordnh/pion has two meanings.[fn-34-P3401_1022993:71-nf] \"When I became a man,\" again Paul says, \"I put away childish things.\"[fn-34-P3402_1023129:72-nf] It is not incomplete size of stature, nor a definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings in things that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends it, as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name \"children\" to those who are under the law, who are terrified by fear as children are by bugbears; and \"men\" to us who are obedient to the Word and masters of ourselves, who have believed, and are saved by voluntary choice, and are rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the apostle himself shall testify, calling as he does the Jews heirs according to the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise: Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors, till the time appointed by the father. So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when the fulness of the time was came, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons \"[fn-34-P3403_1024335:73-nf] by Him. See how He has admitted those to be children who are under fear and sins; but has conferred manhood on those who are under faith, by calling them sons, in contradistinction from the children that are under the law: \"For thou art no more a servant,\" he says, \"but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.\"[fn-34-P3404_1024673:74-nf] What, then, is lacking to the son after inheritance? Wherefore the expression, \"When I was a child,\" may be elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew (for he was a Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I followed the law; but after becoming a man, I no longer entertain the sentiments of a child, that is, of the law, but of a man, that is, of Christ, whom alone the Scripture calls man, as we have said before. \"I put away childish things.\" But the childhood which is in Christ is maturity, as compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must defend our childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the apostle: \"I have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with meat; for ye were not able, neither yet are ye now able.\"[fn-34-P3405_1025462:75-nf] For it does not appear to me that the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for I shall oppose to it also that Scripture, \"I will bring you into that good land which flows with milk and honey.\"[fn-34-P3406_1025683:76-nf] A very great difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these Scriptures, when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized by the milk is the beginning of faith in Christ, then it is disparaged as childish and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat, the rest of the man who is perfect and endowed with knowledge, again distinguished by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a parable, mean something like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat to the following effect: \"I have fed you with milk in Christ; \"and after a slight stop, let us add, \"as children,\" that by separating the words in reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have instructed you in Christ with simple, true, and natural nourishment,-namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing substance of milk swelling out from breasts of love. So that the whole matter may be conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of Christ, instilling into you spiritual nutriment.","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_52_book_i","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Thus, then, the milk which is perfect is perfect nourishment, and brings to that consummation which cannot cease.

Something like this Homer oracularly declares against his will, when he calls righteous men milk-fed (galaktofa/goi).[fn-34-P3409_1027279:78-nf] So also may we take the Scripture: \"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ; \"[fn-34-P3410_1027454:79-nf] so that the carnal may be understood as those recently instructed, and still babes in Christ. For he called those who had already believed on the Holy Spirit spiritual, and those newly instructed and not yet purified carnal; whom with justice he calls still carnal, as minding equally with the heathen the things of the flesh: \"For whereas there is among you envy and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? \"[fn-34-P3411_1027888:80-nf] \"Wherefore also I have given you milk to drink,\" he says; meaning, I have instilled into you the knowledge which, from instruction, nourishes up to life eternal. But the expression, \"I have given you to drink\" (e0po/tisa), is the symbol of perfect appropriation. For those who are full-grown are said to drink, babes to suck. \"For my blood,\" says the Lord, \"is true drink.\"[fn-34-P3412_1028282:81-nf] In saying, therefore, \"I have given you milk to drink,\" has he not indicated the knowledge of the truth, the perfect gladness in the Word, who is the milk? And what follows next, \"not meat, for ye were not able,\" may indicate the clear revelation in the future world, like food, face to face. \"For now we see as through a glass,\" the same apostle says, \"but then face to face.\"[fn-34-P3413_1028678:82-nf] Wherefore also he has added, \"neither yet are ye now able, for ye are still carnal,\" minding the things of the flesh,-desiring, loving, feeling jealousy, wrath, envy. \"For we are no more in the flesh,\"[fn-34-P3414_1028902:83-nf] as some suppose. For with it [they say], having the face which is like an angel's, we shall see the promise face to face. How then, if that is truly the promise after our departure hence, say they that they know \"what eye hath not known, nor hath entered into the mind of man,\" who have not perceived by the Spirit, but received from instruction \"what ear hath not heard,\"[fn-34-P3415_1029294:84-nf] or that ear alone which \"was rapt up into the third heaven? \"[fn-34-P3416_1029373:85-nf] But it even then was commanded to preserve it unspoken.","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_43_oration_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XVII.

For \"meats are for the belly,\"[fn-37-P3715_1124979:3-nf] for on them depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence[fn-37-P3716_1125064:4-nf] some, speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape,[fn-37-P3717_1125165:5-nf] to pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapae. He says accordingly somewhere, \"When thou art called to a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest place; \"[fn-37-P3718_1126057:6-nf] and elsewhere, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper; \"and again, \"But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,\"[fn-37-P3719_1126200:7-nf] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further, \"A certain man made a great supper, and called many.\"[fn-37-P3720_1126338:8-nf] But I perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: \"from the gullets and furious love for suppers\"-according to the comic poet. For, in truth, \"to many, many things are on account of the supper.\" For they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. \"It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.\"[fn-37-P3721_1127286:9-nf] \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-37-P3722_1127368:10-nf] But the hardest of all cases is for charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that is to be done away with? \"For if,\" it is said, \"I bestow all my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.\"[fn-37-P3723_1127680:11-nf] On this love alone depend the law and the Word; and if \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour,\" this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. \"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,\" says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as ephemeral, \"but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3724_1128287:12-nf] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is communication. \"And the care of discipline is love,\" as Wisdom says; \"and love is the keeping of the law.\"[fn-37-P3725_1128634:13-nf] And these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper. But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, \"Let the children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe on Thee.\"[fn-37-P3726_1129036:14-nf] \"For the righteous shall not live by bread.\"[fn-37-P3727_1129101:15-nf] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point which is beyond the sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for communication; having as its rich provision sufficiency, which, presiding over diet measured in due quantity, and treating the body in a healthful way, distributes something from its resources to those near us, But the diet which exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates his spirit, and renders his body prone to disease. Besides, those dainty tastes, which trouble themselves about rich dishes drive to practices of ill-repute, daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity, insatiability. Appropriate designations of such people as so indulge are flies, weasels, flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of parasites-the one class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and the other life, for the gratification of the belly; crawling on their bellies, beasts in human shape after the image of their father, the voracious beast. People first called the abandoneda0sw/touj, and so appear to me to indicate their end, understanding them as those who are (a0sw/souj) unsaved, excluding the j. For those that are absorbed in pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if they were not to live [hereafter]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah, denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love (agape), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word. \"But they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" And that He reckons such luxury to be sin, is shown by what He adds, \"And your sin shall not be forgiven you till you die,\"[fn-37-P3728_1130943:16-nf] -not conveying the idea that death, which deprives of sensation, is the forgiveness of sin, but meaning that death of salvation which is the recompense of sin. \"Take no pleasure in abominable delicacies, says Wisdom.[fn-37-P3729_1131184:17-nf] At this point, too, we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols, in order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them.

Nor indeed were the prayers of the Gentile Cornelius unheard, nor did his alms lack acceptance; nay, he was found worthy that an angel should be sent to him, and that he should behold the messenger, through whom he might assuredly have learned everything that was necessary, without requiring that any man should come to him. But since all the good that he had in his prayers and alms could not benefit him unless he were incorporated in the Church by the bond of Christian brotherhood and peace, he was ordered to send to Peter, and through him learned Christ; and, being also baptized by his orders, he was joined by the tie of communion to the fellowship of Christians, to which before he was bound only by the likeness of good works.[fn-30-P3072_1804140:18-nf] And indeed it would have been most fatal to despise what he did not yet possess, vaunting himself in what he had. So too those who, by separating themselves from the society of their fellows, to the overthrow of charity, thus break the bond of unity, if they observe none of the things which they have received in that society, are separated in everything; and so any one whom they have joined to their society, if he afterwards wish to come over to the Church, ought to receive everything which he has not already received. But if they observe some of the same things, in respect of these they have not severed themselves; and so far they are still a part of the framework of the Church, while in all other respects they are cut off from it. Accordingly, any one whom they have associated with themselves is united to the Church in all those points in which they are not separated from it. And therefore, if he wish to come over to the Church, he is made sound in those points in which he was unsound and went astray; but where he was sound in union with the Church, he is not cured, but recognized,-lest in desiring to cure what is sound we should rather inflict a wound.

But, because many such things are done by men who seek other objects, and who love not the brethren; let us come back to the testimony of conscience. How do we prove that many such things are done by men who love not the brethren? How many in heresies and schisms call themselves martyrs! They seem to themselves to lay down their lives for their brethren. If for the brethren they laid down their lives, they would not separate themselves from the whole brotherhood. Again, how many there are who for the sake of vainglory bestow much, give much, and seek therein but the praise of men and popular glory, which is full of windiness, and possesses no stability! Seeing, then, there are such, where shall be the proof of brotherly charity? Seeing he wished it to be proved, and hath said by way of admonition, \"My little children, let us not love only in word and in tongue; but in deed and in truth;\" we ask, in what work, in what truth? Can there be a more manifest work than to give to the poor? Many do this of vainglory, not of love. Can there be a greater work than to die for the brethren? This also, many would fain be thought to do, who do it of vainglory to get a name, not from bowels of love. It remains, that that man loves his brother, who before God, where God alone seeth, assures his own heart, and questions his. heart whether he does this indeed for love of the brethren; and his witness is that eye which penetrates the heart, where man cannot look. Therefore Paul the Apostle, because he was ready to die for the brethren, and said, \"I will myself be spent for your souls,\"[fn-43-P4354_2357031:7-nf] yet, because God only saw this in his heart, not the mortal men to whom he spake, he saith to them, \"But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or at man's bar.\"[fn-43-P4355_2357235:8-nf] And the same apostle shows also in a certain place, that these things are oft done of empty vainglory, not upon the solid ground of love: for speaking of the praises of charity he saith, \"If I distribute all my goods to the poor. and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-43-P4356_2357572:9-nf] Is it possible for a man to do this without charity? It is. For they that have divided unity, are persons that have not charity. Seek there, and ye shall see many giving much to the poor; shallsee others prepared to welcome death, insomuch that where there is no persecutor they cast themselves headlong: these doubtless without charity do this. Let us come back then to conscience, of which the apostle saith: \"For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-43-P4357_2358064:10-nf] Let us come back to conscience, of which the same saith, \"But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another.\"[fn-43-P4358_2358238:11-nf] Therefore, let each one of us \"prove his own work,\" whether it flow forth from the vein of charity, whether it be from charity as the root that his good works sprout forth as branches. \"But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another,\" not when another's tongue bears witness to him, but when his own conscience bears it.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_53_book_ii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"6. And so it is that often something is imperfectly revealed to the more learned, that their patient and humble charity, from which proceeds the greater fruit, may be proved, either in the way in which they preserve unity, when they hold different opinions on matters of comparative obscurity, or in the temper with which they receive the truth, when they learn that it has been declared to be contrary to what they thought. And of these two we have a manifestation in the blessed Cyprian of the one, viz., of the way in which he preserved unity with those from whom he differed in opinion. For he says, \"Judging no one nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us.\"[fn-31-P3191_1858137:13-nf] And the other, viz., in what temper he could receive the truth when found to be different from what he thought it, though his letters are silent on the point, is yet proclaimed by his merits. If there is no letter extant to prove it, it is witnessed by his crown of martyrdom; if the Council of bishops declare it not, it is declared by the host of angels. For it is no small proof of a most peaceful soul, that he won the crown of martyrdom in that unity from which he would not separate, even though he differed from it. For we are but men; and it is therefore a temptation incident to men that we should hold views at variance with the truth on any point. But to come through too great love for our own opinion, or through jealousy of our betters, even to the sacrilege of dividing the communion of the Church, and of rounding heresy or schism, is a presumption worthy of the devil. But never in any point to entertain an opinion at variance with the truth is perfection found only in the angels. Since then we are men, yet forasmuch as in hope we are angels, whose equals we shall be in the resurrections,[fn-31-P3192_1859273:14-nf] at any rate, so long as we are wanting in the perfection of angels, let us at least be without the presumption of the devil. Accordingly the apostle says, \"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man.\"[fn-31-P3193_1859516:15-nf] It is therefore part of man's nature to be sometimes wrong. Wherefore he says in another place, \"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.\"[fn-31-P3194_1859769:16-nf] But to whom does He reveal it when it is His will (be it in this life or in the life to come), save to those who walk in the way of peace, and stray not aside into any schism? Not to such as those who have not known the way of peace,[fn-31-P3195_1860023:17-nf] or for some other cause have broken the bond of unity. And so, when the apostle said, \"And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,\" lest they should think that besides the way of peace their own wrong views might be revealed to them, he immediately added, \"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.\"[fn-31-P3196_1860432:18-nf] And Cyprian, walking by this rule, by the most persistent tolerance, not simply by the shedding of his blood, but because it was shed in unity (for if he gave his body to be burned, and had not charity, it would profit him nothing[fn-31-P3197_1860683:19-nf] ), came by the confession of martyrdom to the light of the angels, and if not before, at least then, acknowledged the revelation of the truth on that point on which, while yet in error, he did not prefer the maintenance of a wrong opinion to the bond of unity.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"21.

For the Holy Spirit is not only given by the laying on of hands amid the testimony of temporal sensible miracles, as He was given in former days to be the credentials of a rudimentary faith, and for the extension of the first beginnings of the Church. For who expects in these days that those on whom hands are laid that they may receive the Holy Spirit should forthwith begin to speak with tongues? but it is understood that invisibly and imperceptibly, on account of the bond of peace, divine love is breathed into their hearts, so that they may be able to say, \"Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\" But there are many operations of the Holy Spirit, which the same apostle commemorates in a certain passage at such length as he thinks sufficient, and then concludes: \"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.\"[fn-33-P3361_1931216:38-nf] Since, then, the sacrament is one thing, which even Simon Magus could have;[fn-33-P3362_1931313:39-nf] and the operation of the Spirit is another thing, which is even often found in wicked men, as Saul had the gift of prophecy;[fn-33-P3363_1931458:40-nf] and that operation of the same Spirit is a third thing, which only the good can have, as \"the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:\"[fn-33-P3364_1931680:41-nf] whatever, therefore, may be received by heretics and schismatics, the charity which covereth the multitude of sins is the especial gift of Catholic unity and peace; nor is it found in all that are within that bond, since not all that are within it are of it, as we shall see in the proper place. At any rate, outside the bond that love cannot exist, without which all the other requisites, even if they can be recognized and approved, cannot profit or release from sin.

And see what great works pride does. Lay it up in your hearts, how much alike, how much as it were upon a par, are the works it doeth, and the works of charity. Charity feeds the hungry, and so does pride: charity, that God may be praised; pride, that itself may be praised. Charity clothes the naked, so does pride: charity fasts, so does pride: charity buries the dead, so does pride. All good works which charity wishes to do, and does; pride, on the other hand, drives at the same, and, so to say, keeps her horses up to the mark. But charity is between her and it, and leaves not place for ill-driven pride; not ill-driving, but ill-driven. Woe to the man whose charioteer is pride, for he must needs go headlong! But that, in the good that is done, it may not be pride that sets us on, who knows? who sees it? where is it? the works we see: mercy feeds, pride also feeds; mercy takes in the stranger, pride also takes in the stranger; mercy intercedes for the poor, pride also intercedes. How is this? In the works we see no difference. I dare to say somewhat, but not I; Paul hath said it: charity dies, that is, a man having charity confesses the name of Christ, suffers martyrdom: pride also confesses, suffers also martyrdom. The one hath charity, the other hath not charity. But let him that hath not charity hear from the apostle: \"If I distribute all my goods to the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.[fn-45-P4527_2441915:31-nf] So then the divine Scripture calls us off from the display of the face outwardly to that which is within; from this surface which is vaunted before men, it calls us off to that which is within. Return to thy own conscience, question it. Do not consider what blossoms outwardly, but what root there is in the ground. Is lust rooted there? A show there may be of good deeds, truly good works there cannot be. Is charity rooted there? Have no fear: nothing evil can come of that. The proud caresses, love[fn-45-P4528_2442438:32-nf] is severe. The one clothes, the other smites. For the one clothes in order toplease men, the other smites in order to correct by discipline. More accepted is the blow of charity than the alms of pride. Come then within, brethren; and in all things, whatsoever ye do, look unto God your witness. See, if He seeth, with what mind ye do it. If your heart accuse you not that ye do it for the sake of display, it is well: fear ye not. But when ye do good, fear not test another see you. Fear thou lest thou do it to the end that thou mayest be praised: let the other see it, that God may be praised. For if thou hidest it from the eyes of man, thou hidest it from the imitation of man, thou withdrawest from God His praise. Two are there to whom thou doest the alms: two hunger; one for bread, the other for righteousness. Between these two famishing souls:-as it is written, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled:\"[fn-45-P4529_2443412:33-nf] - between these two famishing persons thou the doer of the good work art set; if charity does the work by occasion of the one, therein it hath pity on both, it would succor both. For the one craves what he may eat, the other craves what he may imitate. Thou feedest the one, give thyself as a pattern to the other; so hast thou given alms to both: the one thou hast caused to thank thee for killing his hunger, the other thou hast made to imitate thee by setting him an example.","title":"Homily VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_49_oration_xxxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"IV.

Ye remember, beloved, that of the epistles of John the apostle the last past remains to be handled by us and expounded to you, as the Lord vouchsafes. Of this debt then we are mindful: and ye ought to be mindful of your claim. For indeed this same charity, which in this epistle is chiefly and almost alone commended, at once maketh us most faithful in paying our debts, and you most sweet in exacting your rights. I have said, most sweet in exacting, because where charity is not, he that exacts is bitter: but where charity is, both he that exacts is sweet, and he of whom it is exacted, although he undertakes some labor, yet charity makes the very labor to be almost no labor, and light. Do we not see how, even in dumb and irrational animals, where the love is not spiritual but carnal and natural, with great affection the mother yields herself to her young ones when they will have the milk which is their right: and however impetuously the suckling rushes at the teats, yet that is better for the mother than that it should not suck nor exact that which of love is due? Often we see great calves driving their heads at the cow's udders with a force that almost lifts up the mother's body, yet does she not kick them off; nay, if the young one be not there to suck, the towing of the dam calls for it to come to the teats. If then there be in us that spiritual charity of which the apostle saith, \"I became small in the midst of you even as a nurse cherishing her young ones;\"[fn-45-P4558_2459615:1-nf] we love you the more when ye are exacting. We like not the sluggish, because for the languid ones we are afraid. We have been obliged, however, to intermit the continuous reading of this epistle, because of certain stated lessons coming between, which must needs be read on their holy days, and the same preached upon. Let us now come back to the order which was interrupted; and what remains, holy brethren, receive ye with all attention. I know not whether charity could be more magnificently commended to us, than that it should be said, \"Charity is God.\"[fn-45-P4559_2460193:2-nf] Brief praise, yet mighty praise: brief in utterance, mighty in meaning!

God dwelleth in thee, that He may hold thee: thou dwellest in God, that thou mayest not fall; for thus saith the apostle of this same charity \"Charity never falleth.\"[fn-45-P4560_2460762:3-nf] How should He fall whom God holdeth?","title":"Homily IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_51_iii_conference_of_abbot_paphnutius_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Wherefore it Will not be of much advantage to us that we have made our first renunciation with the utmost devotion and faith, if we do not complete the second with the same zeal and ardour. And so when we have succeeded in this, we shall be able to arrive at the third as well, in which we go forth from the house of our former parent, (who, as we know well, was our father from our Very birth, after the old man, when we were \"by nature children of wrath, as others also,\"[fn-38-P3832_1428347:14-nf] ) and fix our whole mental gaze on things celestial. And of this father Scripture says to Jerusalem which had despised God the true Father, \"Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite;\"[fn-38-P3833_1428559:15-nf] and in the gospel we read \"Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye love to do.\"[fn-38-P3834_1428682:16-nf] And when we have left him, as we pass from things visible to things unseen we shall be able to say with the Apostle: \"But we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a habitation from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\"[fn-38-P3835_1428978:17-nf] and this also, which we quoted a little while ago: \"But our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who will reform the body of our low estate made like to the body of His glory,\"[fn-38-P3836_1429216:18-nf] and this of the blessed David: \"For I am a sojourner upon the earth,\" and \"a stranger as all my fathers were;\"[fn-38-P3837_1429351:19-nf] so that we may in accordance with the Lord's word be made like those of whom the Lord speaks to His Father in the gospel as follows: \"They are not of the world, as I am not of the world,\"[fn-38-P3838_1429594:20-nf] and again to the Apostles themselves: \"If ye were of this world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of this world, therefore the world hateth you.\"[fn-38-P3839_1429783:21-nf] Of this third renunciation then we shall succeed in reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sullied by no stain of carnal coarseness, but, all such having been carefully eliminated, it has been freed from every earthly quality and desire, and by constant meditation on things Divine, and spiritual contemplation has so far passed on to things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things above and things spiritual it no longer feels that it is prisoned in this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up into such an ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy itself with gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see things close at hand, or large objects straight before the very eyes. And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except one who has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience; viz., one, the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all things present, so that he no longer considers them as things that will soon pass away, but as things that are already done with, and sees them vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, \"walking with God,\" and \"translated\" from human life and fashions, not \"be found\" amid the vanities of this life: And that this actually happened corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus tells us. \"And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him.\" And the Apostle also says: \"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,\" the death namely of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"He that liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally.\"[fn-38-P3840_1431450:22-nf] Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought to look to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of parents, home, the riches and pleasures of the world, we may also inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and never be drawn back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those who were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are yet said to have returned in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who had led them forth with such mighty signs, and by worshipping the idols of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says: \"And in their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us,\"[fn-38-P3841_1432211:23-nf] for we should fall into like condemnation with those who, while dwelling in the wilderness, after they had tasted manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and of mean baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way: \"It was well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate the onions, and garlic, and cucumbers, and melons:\"[fn-38-P3842_1432612:24-nf] A form of speech, which, although it referred primarily to that people, we yet see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who after renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts to his former likings asserts in heart and act the very same thing that they did, and says \"It was well with me in Egypt,\" and I am afraid that the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of backsliders of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned as six hundred and three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of this number not more than two entered the land of promise. Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have spoken in the gospel \"Many are called but few\" are said to be \"chosen.\"[fn-38-P3843_1433511:25-nf] A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place from Egypt will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-38-P3844_1433955:26-nf] And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while pride or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher. But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say \"If I bestow my goods.\" For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted persons do. But he says \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,\" i.e., even if my renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this renunciation he adds something still greater: \"And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:\" As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,\"[fn-38-P3845_1435398:27-nf] renouncing them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as to give up my body for Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former sins, because, while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance, which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that love of the Lord which is patient, which is \"kind, which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry, dealeth not perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil,\" which \"beareth all things, endureth all things,\"[fn-38-P3846_1436459:28-nf] and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of sin.","title":"III.

And of this father Scripture says to Jerusalem which had despised God the true Father, \"Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite;\"[fn-38-P3833_1428559:15-nf] and in the gospel we read \"Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye love to do.\"[fn-38-P3834_1428682:16-nf] And when we have left him, as we pass from things visible to things unseen we shall be able to say with the Apostle: \"But we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a habitation from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\"[fn-38-P3835_1428978:17-nf] and this also, which we quoted a little while ago: \"But our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who will reform the body of our low estate made like to the body of His glory,\"[fn-38-P3836_1429216:18-nf] and this of the blessed David: \"For I am a sojourner upon the earth,\" and \"a stranger as all my fathers were;\"[fn-38-P3837_1429351:19-nf] so that we may in accordance with the Lord's word be made like those of whom the Lord speaks to His Father in the gospel as follows: \"They are not of the world, as I am not of the world,\"[fn-38-P3838_1429594:20-nf] and again to the Apostles themselves: \"If ye were of this world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of this world, therefore the world hateth you.\"[fn-38-P3839_1429783:21-nf] Of this third renunciation then we shall succeed in reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sullied by no stain of carnal coarseness, but, all such having been carefully eliminated, it has been freed from every earthly quality and desire, and by constant meditation on things Divine, and spiritual contemplation has so far passed on to things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things above and things spiritual it no longer feels that it is prisoned in this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up into such an ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy itself with gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see things close at hand, or large objects straight before the very eyes. And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except one who has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience; viz., one, the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all things present, so that he no longer considers them as things that will soon pass away, but as things that are already done with, and sees them vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, \"walking with God,\" and \"translated\" from human life and fashions, not \"be found\" amid the vanities of this life: And that this actually happened corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus tells us. \"And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him.\" And the Apostle also says: \"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,\" the death namely of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"He that liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally.\"[fn-38-P3840_1431450:22-nf] Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought to look to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of parents, home, the riches and pleasures of the world, we may also inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and never be drawn back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those who were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are yet said to have returned in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who had led them forth with such mighty signs, and by worshipping the idols of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says: \"And in their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us,\"[fn-38-P3841_1432211:23-nf] for we should fall into like condemnation with those who, while dwelling in the wilderness, after they had tasted manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and of mean baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way: \"It was well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate the onions, and garlic, and cucumbers, and melons:\"[fn-38-P3842_1432612:24-nf] A form of speech, which, although it referred primarily to that people, we yet see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who after renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts to his former likings asserts in heart and act the very same thing that they did, and says \"It was well with me in Egypt,\" and I am afraid that the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of backsliders of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned as six hundred and three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of this number not more than two entered the land of promise. Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have spoken in the gospel \"Many are called but few\" are said to be \"chosen.\"[fn-38-P3843_1433511:25-nf] A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place from Egypt will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-38-P3844_1433955:26-nf] And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while pride or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher. But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say \"If I bestow my goods.\" For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted persons do. But he says \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,\" i.e., even if my renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this renunciation he adds something still greater: \"And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:\" As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,\"[fn-38-P3845_1435398:27-nf] renouncing them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as to give up my body for Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former sins, because, while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance, which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that love of the Lord which is patient, which is \"kind, which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry, dealeth not perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil,\" which \"beareth all things, endureth all things,\"[fn-38-P3846_1436459:28-nf] and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of sin.","title":"III.

But the safe course for us is, not to advance with any rashness of judgment in setting forth a view which has neither been started in any regionary Council of the Catholic Church nor established in a plenary one; but to assert, with all the confidence of a voice that cannot be gainsaid, what has been confirmed by the consent of the universal Church, under the direction of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, if any one were to press me-supposing I were duly seated in a Council in which a question were raised on points like these-to declare what my own opinion was, without reference to the previously expressed views of others, whose judgment I would rather follow, if I were under the influence of the same feelings as led me to assert what I have said before, I should have no hesitation in saying that all men possess baptism who have received it in any place, from any sort of men, provided that it were consecrated in the words of the gospel, and received without deceit on their part with some degree of faith; although it would be of no profit to them for the salvation of their souls if they were without charity, by which they might be grafted into the Catholic Church. For \"though I have faith,\" says the apostle, \"so that I could remove mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing.\"[fn-45-P4563_2285091:158-nf] Just as already, from the established decrees of our predecessors, I have no hesitation in saying that all those have baptism who, though they receive it deceitfully, yet receive it in the Church, or where the Church is thought to be by those in whose society it is received, of whom it was said, \"They went out from us.\"[fn-45-P4564_2285436:159-nf] But when there was no society of those who so believed, and when the man who received it did not himself hold such belief, but the whole thing was done as a farce, or a comedy, or a jest,-if I were asked whether the baptism which was thus conferred should be approved, I should declare my opinion that we ought to pray for the declaration of God's judgment through the medium of some revelation seeking it with united prayer and earnest groanings of suppliant devotion, humbly deferring all the time to the decision of those who were to give their judgment after me, in case they should set forth anything as already known and determined. And, therefore, how much the more must I be considered to have given my opinion now without prejudice to the utterance of more diligent research or authority higher than my own!","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"105","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

For it shall happen to them as to one who expects salvation from another God. Then, finally, contrary to their notion, they are condemned to eternal punishment by Christ, the Son of God the Father omnipotent, the Creator whom they have blasphemed, when God shall begin to judge the hidden things of men according to the Gospel by Christ Jesus, because they did not believe in Him, although they were washed in His name.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":13,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_45_sermon_xxviii_lxxvii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5.

For when the Apostle was being read we heard in praise of charity, \"She seeketh not her own.[fn-43-P4325_1836088:21-nf] She seeketh not her own;\" since she gives what she possesses. In another place there is more danger in the expression, if you do not understand it right. For the Apostle, charging the faithful members of Christ after this rule of charity, says, \"Let no man seek his own, but another's.\"[fn-43-P4326_1836396:22-nf] For on hearing this, covetousness is ready with its deceits, that in a matter of business under pretence of seeking another's, it may defraud a man, and so, \"seek not his own, but another's.\" But let covetousness restrain itself, let justice come forth; so let us hear and understand. It is to charity that it is said, \"Let no man seek his own, but another's.\" Now, O thou covetous one, if thou wilt still resist, and twist the precept rather to this point, that thou shouldest covet what is another's; then lose what is thine own. But as I know thee weIl, thou dost wish to have both thine own and another's. Thou wilt commit fraud that thou mayest have what is another's; submit then to robbery that thou mayest lose thine own. Thou dost not wish to seek thine own, but then thou takest away what is another's. Now this if thou do, thou doest not well.

For as to the driving out of devils, and as to the working of miracles, seeing that very many do not do such things who yet belong to the kingdom of God, and very many do them who do not belong to it, neither our party nor your party have any cause for boasting, if any of them chance to have this power, since the Lord did not think it right that even the apostles, who could truly do such things both to profit and salvation, should boast in things like this, when He says to them, \"In this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.\"[fn-51-P5134_2504232:180-nf] Wherefore all those things which you have advanced from the writings of the gospel I also might repeat to you, if I saw you working the powerful acts of signs and miracles; and so might you repeat them to me, if you saw me doing things of a like sort. Let us not, therefore, say one to another what may equally be said on the other side as well; and, putting aside all quibbles, since we are inquiring where the Church of Christ is to be found, let us listen to the words of Christ Himself, who redeemed it with His own blood: \"Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth.\"[fn-51-P5135_2504892:181-nf] You see then who it is with whom a man refuses to communicate who will not communicate with this Church, which is spread throughout all the world, if at least you hear whose words these are. For what is a greater proof of madness than to hold communion with the sacraments of the Lord, and to refuse to hold communion with the words of the Lord?

Augustin answered: You speak against yourself; but yet, since you speak on the side of truth, if you love it, let what you say be counted for you. For I ask of you of whom it was that the Apostle Paul said this? Let us, if you please, trace this a little further back. \"Some,\" he says, \"preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will, some of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel. But some indeed preach Christ even of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds. What then? notwithstanding every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.\"[fn-52-P5281_2549903:225-nf] We see that they preached what was in itself holy, and pure, and true, but yet not in a pure manner, but of envy and contention, without charity, without purity. Certainty a short time ago you appeared to be urging the praises of charity as against us, according to the witness of the apostle, that where there is no charity, whatever there is is of no avail; and yet you see that in those there is no charity, and there was with them the preaching of Christ, of which the apostle says here that he rejoices. For it is not that he rejoices in what is evil in them, but in what is good in the name of Jesus Christ. In him assuredly there was the charity which \"rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.\"[fn-52-P5282_2550643:226-nf] The envy, moreover, which was in them is an evil proceeding from the devil, for by this he has both killed and cast down. Where then were these wicked men whom the apostle thus condemns, and in whom there was so much that was good to cause him to rejoice? Were they within, or without? Choose which you will. If they were within, then Paul knew them, and yet they did not pollute him. And so you would not be polluted in the unity of the whole world by those of whom you make certain charges, whether these be true, or falsehoods invented by yourselves. Wherefore do you separate yourself? Why do you destroy yourself by the criminal sacrilege of schism? But if they were without, then you see that even in those who were without, and who certainly cannot belong to everlasting life, since they have not charity, and do not abide in unity, there is yet found the holiness of the name of Christ, so that the apostle joyfully confirms their teaching, on account of the intrinsic holiness of the name, although he repudiates them. We are right, therefore, in not doing wrong to the actual name, when those come to us who were without; but we correct the individuals, while we do honor to the name. Do you therefore take heed, and see how wickedly you act in the case of those whose acts as it seems you condemn, by treating as naught the sacrament of the name of Christ, which is holy in them. And you, indeed, as is shown by your words, think that those men of whom the apostle spoke were outside the limits of the Church. Therefore, when you fear persecution from the Catholics, of which you speak in order to create odium against us, you have confirmed in heretics the name of Christ to which you do despite by rebaptizing.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":98,"source_paragraph":"430","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"228. Augustin answered: It is not beside the purpose to inquire into the true meaning of this passage also. For where my purpose is not interfered with by any mistake which you make, or any false impression which you convey in quoting from the Scriptures, I do not concern myself about the matter. It is not then written, \"Whosoever shall lose his substance,\" but \"Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake.\"[fn-54-P5445_2635736:305-nf] And the passage about substance is not, \"Whosoever shall lose,\" but \"Every one that hath forsaken;\"[fn-54-P5446_2635858:306-nf] and that not only with reference to substance of money, but many other things besides. But you meanwhile have not lost your substance; but whether you have forsaken it, in that you so boast of poverty, I cannot say. And if by any chance my colleague Fortunatus may know this, being in the same city with you, he never told me, because I had never asked him. However, even if you had done this, you have yet yourself quoted the testimony of the apostle against yourself in this very epistle which you have written: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-54-P5447_2636530:307-nf] For if you had charity, you would not bring charges against the whole world, which knows nothing of you, and of which you know no more,-no, not even such charges as are rounded on the proved offenses of the Africans. If you had charity, you would not picture to yourself a false unity in your calumnies, but you would learn to recognize the unity that is most clearly set forth in the words of the Lord: \"even in the whole earth.\"[fn-54-P5448_2636984:308-nf] But if you did not do this, why do you boast as though you had done it? Are you really so filled with fear of riches, that, having nothing, you possess all things? Tell that to your colleague Crispinus, who lately bought a farm near our city of Hippo, that he might there plunge men into the lowest abyss.[fn-54-P5449_2637308:309-nf] Whence I too know this all too well. You perhaps are not aware of it, and therefore shout out in security, \"We stand in fear of riches.\" And hence I am surprised that that cry of yours has been allowed to pass Crispinus, so as to reach us. For between Constantina, where you are, and Hippo, where I am, lies Calama, where he is, nearer indeed to our side, but still between us. I wonder, therefore, how it was that he did not first intercept this cry, and strike it back so that it should not reach to our ears; and that he did not, in opposition to you, recite in much more copious phrase a eulogy on riches. For he not only stands in no fear of riches, but he actually loves them. And certainly, before you utter anything about the rest, you should rehearse such views to him. If he makes no corrections, then we have our answer ready. But for yourself, if it be true that you are poor, you have with you my brother Fortunatus. You will be more likely with such sentiments to please him, who is my colleague, than Crispinus, who is your own.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_65_book_v_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For, in fine, the agreement and harmony of the faith of both[fn-71-P7199_2191340:3-nf] contribute to one end-salvation.

For if one by nature knows God, as Basilides thinks, who calls intelligence of a superior order at once faith and kingship, and a creation worthy of the essence of the Creator; and explains that near Him exists not power, but essence and nature and substance; and says that faith is not the rational assent of the soul exercising free-will, but an undefined beauty, belonging immediately to the creature;-the precepts both of the Old and of the New Testament are, then, superfluous, if one is saved by nature, as Valentinus would have it, and is a believer and an elect man by nature, as Basilides thinks; and nature would have been able, one time or other, to have shone forth, apart from the Saviour's appearance. But were they to say that the visit of the Saviour was necessary, then the properties of nature are gone from them, the elect being saved by instruction, and purification, and the doing of good works. Abraham, accordingly, who through hearing believed the voice, which promised under the oak in Mamre,\" I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed,\" was either elect or not. But if he was not, how did he straightway believe, as it were naturally? And if he was elect, their hypothesis is done away with, in as much as even previous to the coming of the Lord an election was found, and that saved: \"For it was reckoned to him for righteousness.\"[fn-72-P7206_2194133:10-nf] For if any one, following Marcion, should dare to say that the Creator (Dhmiourgo/n) saved the man that believed on him, even before the advent of the Lord, (the election being saved with their own proper salvation); the power of the good Being will be eclipsed; in as much as late only, and subsequent to the Creator spoken of by them in words of be good men, it made the attempt to save, and by instruction, and in imitation of him. But if, being such, the good Being save, according to them; neither is it his own that he saves, nor is it with the consent of him who formed the creation that he essays salvation, but by force or fraud. And how can he any more be good, acting thus, and being posterior? But if the locality is different, and the dwelling-place of the Omnipotent is remote from the dwelling-place of the good God; yet the will of him who saves, having been the first to begin, is not inferior to that of the good God.

For if one by nature knows God, as Basilides thinks, who calls intelligence of a superior order at once faith and kingship, and a creation worthy of the essence of the Creator; and explains that near Him exists not power, but essence and nature and substance; and says that faith is not the rational assent of the soul exercising free-will, but an undefined beauty, belonging immediately to the creature;-the precepts both of the Old and of the New Testament are, then, superfluous, if one is saved by nature, as Valentinus would have it, and is a believer and an elect man by nature, as Basilides thinks; and nature would have been able, one time or other, to have shone forth, apart from the Saviour's appearance. But were they to say that the visit of the Saviour was necessary, then the properties of nature are gone from them, the elect being saved by instruction, and purification, and the doing of good works. Abraham, accordingly, who through hearing believed the voice, which promised under the oak in Mamre,\" I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed,\" was either elect or not.

Now we know that neither things which are clear are made subjects of investigation, such as if it is day, while it is day; nor things unknown, and never destined to become clear, as whether the stars are even or odd in number; nor things convertible; and those are so which can be said equally by those who take the opposite side, as if what is in the womb is a living creature or not. A fourth mode is, when, from either side of those, there is advanced an unanswerable and irrefragable argument. If, then, the ground of inquiry, according to all of these modes, is removed, faith is established. For we advance to them the unanswerable consideration, that it is God who speaks and comes to our help in writing, respecting each one of the points regarding which I investigate. Who, then, is so impious as to disbelieve God, and to demand proofs from God as from men? Again, some questions demand the evidence of the senses,[fn-72-P7212_2196612:14-nf] as if one were to ask whether the fire be warm, or the snow white; and some admonition and rebuke, as the question if you ought to honour your parents. And there are those that deserve punishment, as to ask proofs of the existence of Providence. There being then a Providence, it were impious to think that the whole of prophecy and the economy in reference to a Saviour did not take place in accordance with Providence. And perchance one should not even attempt to demonstrate such points, the divine Providence being evident from the sight of all its skilful and wise works which. are seen, some of which take place in order, and some appear in order. And He who communicated to us being and life, has communicated to us also reason, wishing us to live rationally and rightly. For the Word of the Father of the universe is not the uttered word (lo/goj proforiko/j), but the wisdom and most manifest kindness of God, and His power too, which is almighty and truly divine, and not incapable of being conceived by those who do not confes\"-the all-potent will. But since some are unbelieving, and some are disputations, all do not attain to the perfection of the good. For neither is it possible to attain it without the exercise of free choice; nor does the whole depend on our own purpose; as, for example, what is defined to happen.\"For by grace we are saved: \"not, indeed, without good works; but we must, by being formed for what is good, acquire an inclination for it. And we must possess the healthy mind which is fixed on the pursuit of the good; in order to which we have the greatest need of divine grace, and of right teaching, and of holy susceptibility, and of the drawing of the Father to Him. For, bound in this earthly body, we apprehend the objects of sense by means of the body; but we grasp intellectual objects by means of the logical faculty itself. But if one expect to apprehend all things by the senses, he has fallen far from the truth. Spiritually, therefore, the apostle writes respecting the knowledge of God, \"For now we see as through a glass, but then face to face.\"[fn-72-P7213_2198788:15-nf] For the vision of the truth is given but to few. Accordingly, Plato says in the Epinomis, \"I do not say that it is possible for all to be blessed and happy; only a few. Whilst we live, I pronounce this to be the case. But there is a good hope that after death I shall attain all.\" To the same effect is what we find in Moses: \"No man shall see My face, and live.\"[fn-72-P7214_2199174:16-nf] For it is evident that no one during the period of life has been able to apprehend God clearly. But\" the pure in heart shall see God,\"[fn-72-P7215_2199330:17-nf] when they arrive at the final perfection. For since the soul became too enfeebled for the apprehension of realities, we needed a divine teacher. The Saviour is sent down-a teacher and leader in the acquisition of the good-the secret and sacred token of the great Providence. \"Where, then, is the scribe? where is the searcher of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? \"[fn-72-P7216_2199742:18-nf] it is said. And again, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent,\"[fn-72-P7217_2199880:19-nf] plainly of those wise in their own eyes, and disputatious. Excellently therefore Jeremiah says, \"Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and ask for the eternal paths,\"what is the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find expiation for your souls.\"[fn-72-P7218_2200150:20-nf] Ask, he says, and inquire of those who know, without contention and dispute. And on learning the way of truth, let us walk on the right way, without turning till we attain to what we desire: It was therefore with reason that the king of the Romans (his name was Numa), being a Pythagorean, first of all men, erected a temple to Faith and Peace. \"And to Abraham, on believing, righteousness was reckoned.\"[fn-72-P7219_2200573:21-nf] He, prosecuting the lofty philosophy of aerial phenomena, and the sublime philosophy of the movements in the heavens, was called Abram, which is interpreted \"sublime father.\"[fn-72-P7220_2200775:22-nf] But afterwards, on looking up to heaven, whether it was that he saw the Son in the spirit, as some explain, or a glorious angel, or in any other way recognised God to be superior to the creation, and all the order in it, he receives in addition the Alpha, the knowledge of the one and only God, and is called Abraam, having, instead of a natural philosopher, become wise, and a lover of God. For it is interpreted, \"elect father of sound.\" For by sound is the uttered word: the mind is its father; and the mind of the good man is elect.

And what is the character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed Apostle declaring: \"The arms,\" he says \"of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.\" He tells us their character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be used: \"Unto the pulling down of fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be first fulfilled.\"[fn-44-P4426_1628570:12-nf] And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run through these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics, as we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the Lord's battles and to serveamong the centurions of the gospel. \"Take,\" he says \"the shield of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.\"[fn-44-P4427_1629016:13-nf] Faith then is that which intercepts the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. \"And the breastplate,\" he says, \"of charity.\"[fn-44-P4428_1629229:14-nf] This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it \"endureth all things, suffereth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-44-P4429_1629571:15-nf] \"And for an helmet the hope of salvation.\"[fn-44-P4430_1629635:16-nf] The helmet is what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it is possible for one who has lost other parts of the body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living is extended to no one without a head. \"And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.\"[fn-44-P4431_1630117:17-nf] For it is \"sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:\"[fn-44-P4432_1630326:18-nf] as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: \"Why art thou grown old in a strange country?\"[fn-44-P4433_1630738:19-nf] But he will stand like a triumphant conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has chosen. Would you understand too the strength and courage of this centurion, by which he bears these arms of which we spoke before as not carnal but mighty to God? Hear of the selection by which the King himself marks and approves brave men when he summons them to the spiritual combat. \"Let,\" says He, \"the weak say that I am strong;\" and: \"Let him who is the sufferer become a warrior.\"[fn-44-P4434_1631231:20-nf] You see then that none but sufferers and weak people can fight the Lord's battles, weak indeed with that weakness, rounded on which that centurion of ours in the gospel said with confidence: \"For when I am weak, then am I strong,\" and again, \"for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-44-P4435_1631546:21-nf] Of which weakness one of the prophets says: \"And he that is weak among them shall be as the house of David.[fn-44-P4436_1631678:22-nf] For the patient sufferer shall fight these wars, with that patience of which it is said \"patience is necessary for you that doing the will of God you may receive the reward.\"[fn-44-P4437_1631872:23-nf] ","title":"VII.

And therefore if you weigh with a careful scrutiny of heart what is done by each man and consider with what mind it is done or from what feeling it proceeds, you will see that the virtue of patience and gentleness cannot possibly be fulfilled in the opposite spirit, i.e., that of impatience and rage. Since our Lord and Saviour, when giving us a thorough lesson on the virtue of patience and gentleness (i.e., teaching us not only to profess it with our lips, but to store it up in the inmost recesses of the soul) gave us this summary of evangelical perfection, saying: \"If any one smites thee on thy right cheek, offer him the other also\"[fn-57-P5786_2055179:36-nf] (doubtless the \"right\" cheek is mentioned, as another \"right\" cheek cannot be found except in the face of the inner man, so to speak), as by this He desires entirely to remove all incitement to anger from the deepest recesses of the soul, i.e., that if your external right cheek has received a blow from the striker, the inner man also humbly consenting may offer its right cheek to be smitten, sympathizing with the suffering of the outward man, and in a way submitting and subjecting its own body to wrong from the striker, that the inner man may not even silently be disturbed in itself at the blows of the outward man. You see then that they are very far from evangelical perfection, which teaches that patience must be maintained, not in words but in inward tranquillity of heart, and which bids us preserve it whatever evil happens, that we may not only keep ourselves always from disturbing anger, but also by submitting to their injuries compel those, who are disturbed by their own fault, to become calm, when they have had their fill of blows; and so overcome their rage by our gentleness. And so also we shall fulfil these words of the Apostle: \"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\"[fn-57-P5787_2056403:37-nf] And it is quite clear that this cannot be fulfilled by those who utter words of gentleness and humility in such a spirit and rage that they not only fall to lessen the fire of wrath which has been kindled, but rather make it blaze up the more fiercely both in their own feelings and in those of their enraged brother. But these, even if they could in some way keep calm and quiet themselves, would yet not bear any fruits of righteousness, while they claim the glory of patience on their part by their neighbour's loss, and are thus altogether removed from that Apostolic love which \"Seeketh not her own,\"[fn-57-P5788_2057028:38-nf] butthe things of others.

Something of the same kind too is this which is said by the Apostle: \"Not avenging yourselves, dearly beloved: but give place to wrath,\"[fn-58-P5815_2062200:44-nf] i.e., do not under the compulsion of wrath proceed to vengeance, but give place to wrath, i.e., do not let your hearts be confined in the straits of impatience and cowardice so that, when a fierce storm of passion rises, you cannot endure it; but be ye enlarged in your hearts, receiving the adverse waves of anger in the wide gulf of that love which \"suffereth all things, beareth all things;\"[fn-58-P5816_2062614:45-nf] and so your mind will be enlarged with wide long-suffering and patience, and will have within it safe recesses of counsel, in which the foul smoke of anger will be received and be diffused and forthwith vanish away; or else the passage may be taken in this way: we give place to wrath, as often as we yield with humble and tranquil mind to the passion of another, and bow to the impatience of the passionate, as if we admitted that we deserved any kind of wrong. But those who twist the meaning of the perfection of which the Apostle speaks so as to make out that those give place to anger, who go away from a man in a rage, seem to me not to cut off but rather to foment the incitement to quarrelling, for unless a neighbour's wrath is overcome at once by amends being humbly made, a man provokes rather than avoids it by his flight. And there is something like this that Solomon says: \"Be not hasty in thy spirit to be wroth, for anger reposes in the bosom of fools;\" and: \"Be not quick to rush into a quarrel, lest thou repent thereof at the last\"[fn-58-P5817_2063686:46-nf] For he does not blame a hasty exhibition of quarrelling and anger in such a way as to praise a tardy one. In the same way too must this be taken: \"A fool declares his anger in the very same hour, but a prudent man hides his shame.\"[fn-58-P5818_2063951:47-nf] For hedoes not lay it down that a shamefuloutburst of anger ought to be hidden by wise men in such a way that while he blames a speedy outburst of anger he fails to forbid a tardy one, as certainly, if owing to human weakness it does burst forth, he means that it should be hidden for this reason, that while for the moment it is wisely covered up, it may be destroyed forever. For the nature of anger is such that when it is given room it languishes and perishes, but if openly exhibited, it burns more and more. The hearts then should be enlarged and openedwide, lest they be confined in the narrow straits of cowardice, and be filled with the swelling surge of wrath, and so we become unable to receive what the prophet calls the \"exceeding broad\" commandment of God in our narrow heart, or to say with the prophet: \"I have run the way of thy commandments for thou hast enlarged my heart.\"[fn-58-P5819_2064864:48-nf] For that long-suffering is wisdom we are taught by very clear passages of Scripture: for \"a man who is long-suffering is great in prudence; but a coward is very foolish.\"[fn-58-P5820_2065064:49-nf] And therefore Scripture says of him who to his credit asked the gift of wisdom from the Lord: \"God gave Solomon wisdom and prudence exceeding much, and largeness of heart as the sand of the sea for multitude.\"[fn-58-P5821_2065295:50-nf] ","title":"XVI.

My brethren, I indeed am a disciple of Christ, and, moreover, an apostle of Jesus; and it is owing to the exceeding kindness of Marcellus that I have hastened hither, with the view of showing him clearly in what manner he ought to keep the system of divine religion, so that the said Marcellus verily, who at present has put himself, like one who has surrendered himself prisoner, under the doctrine of Archclaus, may not, like the dumb animals, which are destitute of intellect and understand not what they do, be fatally smitten to the ruin of his soul, in consequence of any failure in the possession of further facilities for setting about the right observance of divine worship. I know, furthermore, and am certain, that if Marcellus is once set right,[fn-33-P3347_874919:97-nf] it will be quite possible that all of you may also have your salvation effected; for your city hangs suspended upon his judgment. If vain presumption is rejected by every one of you, and if those things which are to be declared by me be heard with a real love for the truth, ye will receive the inheritance of the age to come, and the kingdom of heaven. I, in sooth, am the Paraclete, whose mission was announced of old time by Jesus, and who was to come to \"convince the world of sin and unrighteousness.\"[fn-33-P3348_875483:98-nf] And even as Paul, who was sent before me, said of himself, that \"he knew in part, and prophesied in part,\"[fn-33-P3349_875929:99-nf] so I reserve the perfect for myself, in order that I may do away with that which is in part. Therefore receive ye this third testimony, that I am an elect apostle of Christ; and if ye choose to accept my words, ye will find salvation; but if ye refuse them, eternal fire will have you to consume you. For as Hymenaeus and Alexander were\" delivered unto Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme,\"[fn-33-P3350_876352:100-nf] so will all ye also be delivered unto the prince of punishments, because ye have done injury to the Father of Christ, in so far as ye declare Him to be the cause of all evils, and the founder of unrighteousness, and the creator of all iniquity. By such doctrine ye do, indeed, bring forth from the same fountain both sweet water and bitter,-a thing which can in no possible way be either done or apprehended. For who ought to be believed? Should it be those masters of yours whose enjoyment is in the flesh, and who pamper themselves with the richest delights; or our Saviour Jesus Christ, who says, as it is written in the book of the Gospels, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\"[fn-33-P3351_877114:101-nf] and who in another place assures us that the \"father of the devil[fn-33-P3352_877202:102-nf] is a liar and a murderer from the beginning,\"[fn-33-P3353_877271:103-nf] and tells us again that men's desire was for the darkness,[fn-33-P3354_877352:104-nf] so that they would not follow that Word that had been sent forth in the beginning from the light,[fn-33-P3355_877491:105-nf] and (once more shows us) the man who is the enemy of the same, the sower of tares,[fn-33-P3356_877871:106-nf] and the god and prince of the age of this world, who blinds the minds of men that they may not be obedient to the truth in the Gospel of Christ?[fn-33-P3357_878039:107-nf] Is that God good who has no wish that the men who are his own should be saved? And, not to go over a multitude of other matters, and waste much time, I may defer[fn-33-P3358_878235:108-nf] till another opportunity the exposition of the true doctrine; and taking it for granted that I have said enough on this subject for the present, I may revert to the matter immediately before me, and endeavour satisfactorily to demonstrate the absurdity of these men's teaching, and show that none of these things can be attributed to the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour, but that we must take Satan to be the cause of all our ills. To him, certainly, these must be carried back, for all ills of this kind are generated by him. But those things also which are written in the prophets and the law are none the less to be ascribed to him; for he it is who spake then in the prophets, introducing into their minds very many ignorant notions of God, as well as temptations and passions. They, too, set forth that devourer of blood and flesh; and to that Satan and to his prophets all these things properly pertain which he wished to transfer[fn-33-P3359_879243:109-nf] to the Father of Christ, prepared as he was to write a few things in the way of truth, that by means of these he might also gain credence for those other statements of his which are false. Hence it is well for us to receive nothing at all of all those things which have been written of old even down to John, and indeed to embrace only the kingdom of heaven, which has been preached in the Gospel since his days; for they verily but made a mockery of themselves, introducing as they did things ridiculous and ludicrous, keeping some small words given in obscure outline in the law, but not understanding that, if good things are mixed up with evil, the result is, that by the corruption of these evil things, even those others which are good are destroyed. And if, indeed, there is any one who may prove himself able to demonstrate that the law upholds the right, that law ought to be kept; but if we can show it to be evil, then it ought to be done away with and rejected, inasmuch as it contains the ministration of death, which was graven,[fn-33-P3360_880308:110-nf] which also covered and destroyed the glory on the countenance of Moses.[fn-33-P3361_880399:111-nf] It is a thing not without peril, therefore, for any one of you to teach the New Testament along with the law and the prophets, as if they were of one and the same origin; for the knowledge of our Saviour renews the one from day to day, while the other grows old and infirm, and passes almost into utter destruction.[fn-33-P3362_880737:112-nf] And this is a fact manifest to those who are capable of exercising discernment. For just as, when the branches of a tree become aged, or when the trunk ceases to bear fruit any more, they are cut down; and just as, when the members of the body suffer mortification, they are amputated, for the poison of the mortification diffuses itself from these members through the whole body, and unless some remedy be found for the disease by the skill of the physician, the whole body will be vitiated; so, too, if ye receive the law without understanding its origin, ye will ruin your souls, and lose your salvation. For \"the law and the prophets were until John; \"[fn-33-P3363_881420:113-nf] but since John the law of truth, the law of the promises, the law of heaven, the new law, is made known to the race of man. And, in sooth, as long as there was no one to exhibit to you this most true knowledge of our Lord Jesus, ye had not sin. Now, however, ye both see and hear, and yet ye desire to walk in ignorance,[fn-33-P3364_881762:114-nf] in order that ye may keep[fn-33-P3365_882007:115-nf] that law which has been destroyed and abandoned. And Paul, too, who is held to be the most approved apostle with us, expresses himself to the same effect in one of his epistles, when he says: \"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.\"[fn-33-P3366_882339:116-nf] And in saying this he pronounces on them as Gentiles, because they were under the elements of the world,[fn-33-P3367_882507:117-nf] before the fulness of faith came, believing then as they did in the law and the prophets.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":13,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-06","text":"36. None of your party[fn-36-P3641_1010742:367-nf] O Manes, will you make a Galatian; neither will you in this fashion divert us[fn-36-P3642_1010906:368-nf] from the faith of Christ. Yea, even although you were to work signs and wonders, although you were to raise the dead, although you were to present to us the very image of Paul himself, you would remain accursed still.[fn-36-P3643_1011265:369-nf] For we have been instructed beforehand with regard to you: we have been both warned and armed against you by the Holy Scriptures. You are a vessel of Antichrist; and no vessel of honour, in sooth, but a mean and base one, used by him as any barbarian or tyrant may do, who, in attempting to make an inroad on a people living under the righteousness of the laws,[fn-36-P3644_1011813:370-nf] sends some select vessel on beforehand, as it were destined to death, with the view of finding out the exact magnitude and character of the strength possessed by the legitimate king and his nation: for the man is too much afraid to make the inroad himself wholly at unawares, and he also lacks the daring to despatch any person belonging to his own immediate circle on such a task, through fear that he may sustain some harm. And so it is that your king, Antichrist, has despatched you in a similar character, and as it were destined to death, to us who are a people placed under the administration of the good and holy King. And this I do not say inconsiderately or without due inquiry; but from the fact that I see you perform no miracle, I hold myself entitled to entertain such sentiments concerning you. For we are given to understand beforehand that the devil himself is to be transformed into an angel of light, and that his servants are to make their appearance in similar guise, and that they are to work signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, the very elect should be deceived.[fn-36-P3645_1012986:371-nf] But who, pray, are you then, to whose lot no such position of kinship has been assigned by your father Satan?[fn-36-P3646_1013119:372-nf] For whom have you raised from the dead? What issue of blood do you ever staunch? What[fn-36-P3647_1013406:373-nf] eyes of the blind do you ever anoint with clay, and thus cause them to have vision? When do you ever refresh a hungering multitude with a few loaves? Where do you ever walk upon the water, or who of those who dwell in Jerusalem has ever seen you? O Persian barbarian, you have never been able to have a knowledge of the language of the Greeks, or of the Egyptians, or of the Romans, or of any other nation; but the Chaldean tongue alone has been known to you, which verily is not a language prevalent among any great number of people,[fn-36-P3648_1014009:374-nf] and you are not capable of understanding any one of another nationality when he speaks. Not thus is it with the Holy Spirit: God forbid; but He divides to all, and knows all kinds of tongues, and has understanding of all things, and is made all things to all men, so that the very thoughts of the heart cannot escape His cognizance. For what says the Scripture? \"That every man heard the apostles speak in his own language through the Spirit, the Paraclete.\"[fn-36-P3649_1014695:375-nf] But why should I say more on this subject?[fn-36-P3650_1014757:376-nf] Barbarian[fn-36-P3651_1014910:377-nf] priest and crafty coadjutor of Mithras, you will only be a worshipper of the sun-god Mithras, who is the illuminator of places of mystic import, as you opine, and the self-conscious deity; \"[fn-36-P3652_1015158:378-nf] that is, you will sport as his worshippers do, and you will celebrate, though with less elegance as it were, his mysteries.[fn-36-P3653_1015336:379-nf] But why should I take all this so indignantly? Is it not accordant with all that is fitting, that you should multiply yourself like the tares, until that same mighty father of yours comes, raising the dead, as he will profess to do, and persecuting almost to hell itself all those who refuse to yield to his bidding, keeping multitudes in check by that terror of arrogance in which he entrenches himself, and employing threatenings against others, and making sport of them by the changing of his countenance and his deceitful dealing?[fn-36-P3654_1016238:380-nf] And yet beyond that he shall proceed no further; for his folly shall be made manifest to all men, as was the case with Jamnes and Mambres.[fn-36-P3655_1016922:381-nf] The judges said: As we have heard now from you, as Paul himself also seems to tell us, and, further, as we have learned likewise from the earlier account given in the Gospel, an introduction to preaching, or teaching, or evangelizing, or prophesying, is not, in this life at least, held out on the same terms to any person in times subsequent to the apostle's:[fn-36-P3656_1017308:382-nf] and if the opposite appears ever to be the case, the person can only be held to be a false prophet or a false Christ. Now, since yon have alleged that the Paraclete was in Paul, and that He attested all things in him, how is it that Paul himself said, \"We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away? \"[fn-36-P3657_1017906:383-nf] What other one did he look for, when he uttered these words? For if he professes himself to be looking for some perfect one, and if some one must needs come, show us who it is of whom he speaks; lest that word of his perchance appear to carry us back to this man, Manes, or to him who has sent him, that is to say, Satan, according to your affirmation. But if you admit that that which is perfect is yet to come, then this excludes Satan; and if you look for the coming of Satan, then that excludes the perfect.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":13,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-06","text":"37. Archelaus said: Those sayings which are put forth by the blessed Paul were not uttered without the direction of God, and therefore it is certain that what he has declared to us is that we are to look for our Lord Jesus Christ as the perfect one, who[fn-36-P3659_1018697:384-nf] is the only one that knows the Father, with the sole exception of him to whom He has chosen also to reveal Him,[fn-36-P3660_1018891:385-nf] as I am able to demonstrate from His own words. But let it be observed, that it is said that when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. Now this man (Manes) asserts that he is the perfect one. Let him show us, then, what he has done away with; for what is to be done away with is the ignorance which is in us. Let him therefore tell us what he has done away with, and what he has brought into the sphere of our knowledge. If he is able to do anything of this nature, let him do it now, in order that he may be believed. These very words of Paul's, if one can but understand them in the full power of their meaning, will only secure entire credit to the statements made by me. For in that first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul speaks in the following terms of the perfection that is to come: \"Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be destroyed: for we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\"[fn-36-P3661_1020020:386-nf] Observe now what virtue that which is perfect possesses in itself, and of what order that perfection is. And let this man, then, tell us what prophecy of the Jews or Hebrews he has done away with; or what tongues he has caused to cease, whether of the Greeks or of others who worship idols; or what alien dogma she has destroyed, whether of a Valentinian, or a Marcion, or a Tatian, or a Sabellius, or any others of those who have constructed for themselves their peculiar systems of knowledge. Let him tell us which of all these he has already done away with, or when he is yet to do away with any one of them, in this character of the perfect one. Perchance he seeks some sort of truce-does he?[fn-36-P3662_1020743:387-nf] But not thus inconsiderable, not thus obscure[fn-36-P3663_1020832:388-nf] and ignoble, will be the manner of the advent of Him who is the truly perfect one, that is to say, our Lord Jesus Christ. Nay, but as a king, when he draws near to his city, does first of all send on before him his life-guardsmen,[fn-36-P3664_1021178:389-nf] his ensigns and standards and banners,[fn-36-P3665_1021287:390-nf] his generals and chiefs and prefects, and then forthwith all objects are roused and excited in different fashions, while some become inspired with terror and others with exultation at the prospect of the king'sadvent; so also my Lord Jesus Christ, who is the truly perfect one, at His coming will first send on before Him His glory, and the consecrated heralds of an unstained and untainted kingdom: and then the universal creation will be moved and perturbed, uttering prayers and supplications, until He delivers it from its bondage.[fn-36-P3666_1021856:391-nf] And it must needs be that the race of man shall then be in fear and in vehement agitation on account of the many offences it has committed. Then the righteous alone will rejoice, as they look for the things which have been promised them; and the subsistence of the affairs of this world will no longer be maintained, but all things shall be destroyed: and whether they be prophecies or the books of prophets, they shall fail; whether they be the tongues of the whole race, they shall cease; for men will no longer need to feel anxiety or to think solicitously about those things which are necessary for life; whether it be knowledge, by what teachers soever it be possessed, it shall also be destroyed: for none of all these things will be able to endure the advent of that mighty King. For just as a little spark, if[fn-36-P3667_1022700:392-nf] taken and put up against the splendour of the sun, at once perishes from the view, so the whole creation, all prophecy, all knowledge, all tongues, as we haw said above, shall be destroyed. But since the capacities of common human nature are all insufficient to set forth in a few words, and these so weak and so extremely poor, the coming of this heavenly King,-so much so, indeed, that perchance it should be the privilege only of the saintly and the highly worthy to attempt any statement on such a subject,-it may yet be enough for me to be able to say that I have advanced what I have now advanced on that theme on the ground of simple necessity,-compelled, as I have been, to do thus much by this person's importunity, and simply with the view of showing you what kind of character he is.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":13,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"ANF-06","text":"48. On hearing these statements, the multitudes assembled were greatly moved, as if they felt that these reasonings gave the correct account of the truth, and that Archelaus could have nothing to urge against them; for this was indicated by the commotion which arose among them. But when the crowd of auditors became quiet again, Archelaus made answer in the following manner: No one, truly, shall ever be able to prove himself mightier than the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ, neither is there found any name equal to His, as it is written: \"Wherefore God hath exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name.\"[fn-38-P3865_1095031:577-nf] Nor, again, in the matter of testimony can any one ever be equal to Him; and accordingly I shall simply adduce the testimonies of His own voice in answer to you,-first of all, indeed, with the view of solving those difficulties which have been enunciated by you, so that you may not say, as is your wont to do, that these are matters which are not in harmony with the Person Himself.[fn-38-P3866_1095435:578-nf] Now, you maintain that the man who brought the word to Jesus about His mother and His brethren was rebuked by Him as if he was in error, as the writer was in error.[fn-38-P3867_1095618:579-nf] Well, I affirm that neither was this person rebuked who brought Him the message about His mother and His brethren, nor was Peter only named blessed above him; but each of these two parties received from Him the answer that was properly called forth by their several utterances, as the discourse will demonstrate in what follows. When one is a child, he thinks as a child, he speaks as a child; but when he becomes a mature man, those things are to be done away which are proper for a child:[fn-38-P3868_1096182:580-nf] in other words, when one reaches forth unto those things which are before, he will forget those which are behind.[fn-38-P3869_1096320:581-nf] Hence, when our Lord Jesus Christ was engaged in teaching and healing the race of men, so that all pertaining to it might not utterly perish together, and when the minds of all those who were listening to Him were intently occupied with these interests, it made an interruption altogether inopportune when this messenger came in and put Him in mind of His mother and His brethren. What then? Ought He, now,[fn-38-P3870_1096749:582-nf] yourself being judge,[fn-38-P3871_1096867:583-nf] to have left those whom He was healing and instructing, and gone to speak with His mother and His brethren? Would you not by such a supposition at once lower the character of the Person Himself? When, again, He chose certain men who were laden and burdened with sins for the honour of discipleship,[fn-38-P3872_1097257:584-nf] to the number of twelve, whom He also named His apostles, He gave them this injunction, Leave father and mother, that you may be made worthy of me;[fn-38-P3873_1097656:585-nf] intending by this that thence forward the memory of father or mother should no more impair the stedfastness of their heart. And on another occasion, when a different individual chose to say to Him, \"I will go and bury my father,\" He answered, \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"[fn-38-P3874_1097951:586-nf] Behold, then, how my Lord Jesus Christ edifies His disciples unto all things necessary, and delivers His sacred words to every one, in due accordance with what is meet for him. And just in the same way, too, on this other occasion, when a certain person came in with the inconsiderate message about His mother, He did not embrace the occurrence as an opportunity for leaving His Father's commission unattended to even for the sake of having His mother with Him. But in order to show you still more clearly that this is the real account of the matter, let me remind you that Peter, on a certain season, subsequent to the time of his receiving that declaration of blessedness from Him, said to Jesus, \"Be it far from Thee, Lord:[fn-38-P3875_1098703:587-nf] this shall not be unto Thee.\"[fn-38-P3876_1098764:588-nf] This he said after Jesus had announced to him that the Son of man must go up to Jerusalem, and be killed, and rise again the third day.[fn-38-P3877_1098970:589-nf] And in answer then to Peter He said: \"Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.\"[fn-38-P3878_1099134:590-nf] Now, since it is your opinion that the man who brought the message about His mother and His brethren was rebuked by Jesus, and that he who said a little before, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,\" obtained the word of blessing, mark you that Jesus (may be said to have) rather preferred that person to whom He condescended to give the more gracious and indulgent answer; whereas Peter, even after that benediction, now got no appellation expressive of indulgence addressed to him, by reason of his having failed carefully to observe the nature of the announcement that was made to him. For the error of that messenger was at once corrected by the tenor of the reply; but the dulness of this apostle's apprehension was condemned with a severer rebuke. And from this you may perceive that the Lord Jesus, observing what was proper and opportune with regard to the interrogations thus addressed to Him, gave to each the reply that was worthy of it, and suited to it. But supposing that, as you say, Peter was pronounced blessed on the ground of his having said what was true, and that that messenger was reproved on account of the error he committed, tell me then why it is, that when the devils confessed Him, and said, \"We know Thee, who Thou art, the holy God,\"[fn-38-P3879_1100488:591-nf] He rebuked them, and commanded them to be silent?[fn-38-P3880_1100610:592-nf] Why was it not the case, if He does indeed take pleasure in the testimonies borne to Him by those who confess Him, that He recompensed them also with benedictions, as He did to Peter when he gave utterance to the truth? But if that would be an absurd supposition, it only remains that we must understand the words spoken by Him always in accordance with the place, the time, the persons, the subjects, and the due consideration of the circumstances.[fn-38-P3881_1101161:593-nf] For only this method will save us from falling into the error of pronouncing rashly on His sayings, and thus making ourselves liable to merited chastisement: and this will also help me to make it more and more intelligible to you, that the man who brought the tidings of His mother was much rather the person honoured.[fn-38-P3882_1101511:594-nf] However, in forgetfulness of the subject which was proposed to us for discussion, you have turned off to a different theme. Nevertheless listen to me for a brief space. For if you choose, indeed, to consider those words somewhat more carefully, we shall find that the Lord Jesus displayed great clemency in the case of the former of these two parties; and this I shall prove to you by illustrations stilted to your capacity. A certain king who had taken up arms, and gone forth to meet an enemy, was earnestly considering and planning how he might subdue those hostile and foreign forces. And when his mind was occupied with many cares and anxieties, after he had forced his way among his adversaries, and when, further, as he began afterwards to make captives of them, the anxious thought was now also pressing upon him as to how he might secure the safety and interests of those who had toiled with him, and borne the burden of the war,[fn-38-P3883_1102693:595-nf] a certain messenger broke inopportunely in upon him, and began to remind him of domestic matters. But he was astonished at the man's boldness, and at his unseasonable suggestions, and thought of delivering such a fellow over to death. And had that messenger not been one who was able to appeal to his tenderest affections in bringing the news that it was well with those at home, and that all went on prosperously and successfully there, that punishment might have been his instant and well-merited doom. For what else should be a king's care, so long as the time of war endures, than to provide for the safety of the people of his province, and to look after military matters? And even thus it also was that that messenger came inopportunely in upon my Lord Jesus Christ, and brought the report about His mother and His brethren unseasonably, just when He was fighting against ills which had assailed the very citadel of the heart, and when He was healing those who for a long time had been under the power of diverse infirmities, and when He had now put forth His utmost effort to secure the salvation of all. And truly that man might have met with a sentence like that pronounced on Peter, or even one severer still. But the hearing of the name of His mother and His brethren drew forth His clemency.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":13,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_88_tractate_lxxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. But when He said in this way here, \"This is my commandment,\" as if there were none else, what are we to think, my brethren? Is, then, the commandment about that love wherewith we love one another, His only one? Is there not also another that is still greater,-that we should love God? Or has God in very truth given us such a charge about love alone, that we have no need of searching for others? There are three things at least that the apostle commends when he says, \"But now abide faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\"[fn-29-P2929_1676881:6-nf] And although in charity, that is, in love, are comprehended the two commandments; yet it is here declared to be the greatest only, and not the sole one. Accordingly, what a host of commandments are given us about faith, what a multitude about hope! who is there that could collect them together, or suffice to number them? But let us ponder the words of the same apostle: \"Love is the fullness of the law.\"[fn-29-P2930_1677308:7-nf] And so, where there is love, what can be wanting? and where it is not, what is there that can possibly be profitable? The devil believes,[fn-29-P2931_1677464:8-nf] but does not love: no one loveth who doth not believe. One may, indeed, hope for pardon who does not love, but he hopes in vain; but no one can despair who loves. Therefore, where there is love, there of necessity will there be faith and hope; and where there is the love of our neighbor, there also of necessity will be the love of God. For he that loveth not God, how loveth he his neighbour as himself, seeing that he loveth not even himself? Such an one is both impious and iniquitous; and he that loveth iniquity, manifestly loveth not, but hateth his own soul.[fn-29-P2932_1678047:9-nf] Let us, therefore, be holding fast to this precept of the Lord, to love one another; and then all else that is commanded we shall do, for all else we have contained in this. But this love is distinguished from that which men bear to one another as such; for in order to mark the distinction, it is added, \"as I have loved you.\" And wherefore is it that Christ loveth us, but that we may be fitted to reign with Christ? With this aim, therefore, let us also be loving one another, that we may manifest the difference of our love from that of others, who have no such motive in loving one another, because the love itself is wanting. But those whose mutual love has the possession of God Himself for its object, will truly love one another; and, therefore, even for the very purpose of loving one another, they love God. There is no such love as this in all men; for few have this motive for their love one to another, that God may be all in all.[fn-29-P2933_1679351:10-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_91_tractate_lxxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. It is a worthy subject of inquiry how these words of the Lord are to be understood, \"But I have called you friends: for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\" For who is there that dare affirm or believe that any man knoweth all things that the only-begotten Son hath heard of the Father; when there is no one that can comprehend even how He heareth any word of the Father, being as He is Himself the only Word of the Father? Nay more, is it not the case that a little afterwards, in this same discourse, which He delivered to the disciples between the Supper and His passion, He said, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\"?[fn-29-P2974_1694110:1-nf] How, then, are we to understand that He made known unto the disciples all that He had heard of the Father, when there are many things that He saith not, just because He knows that they cannot bear them now? Doubtless what He is yet to do He says that He has done as the same Being who hath made those things which are yet to be.[fn-29-P2975_1694457:2-nf] For as He says by the prophet, \"They pierced my hands and my feet,\"[fn-29-P2976_1694542:3-nf] and not, They will yet pierce; but speaking as it were of the past, and yet predicting what Was still in the future: so also in the passage before us He declares that He has made known to the disciples all, that He knows He will yet make known in that fullness of knowledge, whereof the apostle says, \"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" For in the same place he adds: \"Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known; and now through a glass in a riddle, but then face to face.\"[fn-29-P2977_1695111:4-nf] For the same apostle also says that we have been saved by the washing of regeneration,[fn-29-P2978_1695222:5-nf] and yet declares in another place, \"We are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is no hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-29-P2979_1695453:6-nf] To a similar purpose it is also said by his fellow-apostle Peter, \"In whom, though now seeing Him not, ye believe; and in whom, when ye see Him, ye shall rejoice with a joy unspeakable and glorious: receiving the reward of faith, even the salvation of your souls.\"[fn-29-P2980_1695740:7-nf] If, then, it is now the season of faith, and faith's reward is the salvation of our souls; who, in that faith which worketh by love,[fn-29-P2981_1695892:8-nf] can doubt that the day must come to an end, and at its close the reward be received; not only the redemption of our body, whereof the Apostle Paul speaketh,[fn-29-P2982_1696063:9-nf] but also the salvation of our souls, as we are told by the Apostle Peter? For the felicity springing from both is at this present time, and in the existing state of mortality, a matter rather of hope than of actual possession. But this it concerns us to remember, that our outward man, to wit the body, is still decaying; but the inward, that is, the soul, is being renewed day by day.[fn-29-P2983_1696468:10-nf] Accordingly, while we are waiting for the immortality of the flesh and salvation of our souls in the future, yet with the pledge we have received, it may be said that we are saved already; so that knowledge of all things which the Only-begotten hath heard of the Father we are to regard as a matter of hope still lying in the future, although declared by Christ as something He had already imparted.","title":"Tractate LXXXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_68_the_gospel_of_pseudo_matthew","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"ANF-08","text":" A second time the master Zachyas, doctor of the law, said to Joseph and Mary: Give me the boy, and I shall hand him over to master Levi, who shall teach him his letters and instruct him. Then Joseph and Mary, soothing Jesus, took Him to the schools, that He might be taught His letters by old Levi. And as soon as He went in He held His tongue. And the master Levi said one letter to Jesus, and, beginning from the first letter Aleph, said to Him: Answer. But Jesus was silent, and answered nothing. Wherefore the preceptor Levi was angry, and seized his storax-tree rod, and struck Him on the head. And Jesus said to the teacher Levi: Why dost thou strike me? Thou shall know in truth, that He who is struck can teach him who strikes Him more than He can be taught by him. For I can teach you those very things that yon are saying. But all these are blind who speak and hear, like sounding brass or tinkling cymbal, in which there is no perception of those things which are meant by their sound.[fn-61-P6150_1813826:62-nf] And Jesus in addition said to Zachyas: Every letter from Aleph even to Thet[fn-61-P6151_1813931:63-nf] is known by its arrangement. Say thou first, therefore, what Thet is, and I will tell thee what Aleph is. And again Jesus said to them: Those who do not know Aleph, how can they say Thet, the hypocrites? Tell me what the first one, Aleph, is; and I shall then believe you when you have said Beth. And Jesus began to ask the names of the letters one by one, and said: Let the master of the law tell us what the first letter is, or why it has many triangles, gradate, subacute, mediate, obduced, produced, erect, prostrate, curvistrate.[fn-61-P6152_1814534:64-nf] And when Levi heard this, he was thunderstruck at such an arrangement of the names of the letters. Then he began in the heating of all to cry out, and say: Ought such a one to live on the earth? Yea, he ought to be hung on the great cross. For he can put out fire, and make sport of other modes of punishment. I think that he lived before the flood, and was born before the deluge. For what womb bore him? or what mother brought him forth? or what breasts gave him suck? I flee before him; I am not able to withstand the words from his mouth, but my heart is astounded to hear such words. I do not think that any man can understand what he says, except God were with him. Now I, unfortunate wretch, have given myself up to be a laughing-stock to him. For when I thought I had a scholar, I, not knowing him, have found my master. What shall I say? I cannot withstand the words of this child: I shall now flee from this town, because I cannot understand them. An old man like me has been beaten by a boy, because I can find neither beginning nor end of what he says. For it is no easy matter to find a beginning of himself.[fn-61-P6153_1816466:65-nf] I tell you of a certainty, I am not lying, that to my eyes the proceedings of this boy, the commencement of his conversation, and the upshot of his intention, seem to have nothing in common with mortal man. Here then I do not know whether he be a wizard or a god; or at least an angel of God speaks in him. Whence he is, or where he comes from, or who he will turn out to be, I know not. Then Jesus, smiling at him with a joyful countenance, said in a commanding voice to all the sons of Israel standing by and hearing: Let the unfruitful bring forth fruit, and the blind see, and the lame walk right, and the poor enjoy the good things of this life, and the dead live, that each may return to his original state, and abide in Him who is the root of life and of perpetual sweetness. And when the child Jesus had said this, forthwith all who had fallen under malignant diseases were restored. And they did not dare to say anything more to Him, or to hear anything from Him.","title":"The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"},{"chapter":13,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_97_epistle_lxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-05","text":"21. Can the power of baptism be greater or of more avail than confession, than suffering, when one confesses Christ before men and is baptized in his own blood?

Our Saviour's holy disciples, after getting beyond the limits of human thought, and then being purified by the word,[fn-27-P2701_907540:45-nf] are enquiring about the end, and longing to know the ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His angels and to Himself. He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of God, a day; and the contemplation of the One-ness and Unity, knowledge of which He attributes to the Father alone, an hour. I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to know of Himself what is; and not to know what is not God, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is said to know righteousness and wisdom; but to be ignorant of unrighteousness and wickedness; for God who created us is not unrighteousness and wickedness. If, then, God is said to know about Himself that which is, and not to know that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the purpose of the Incarnation and the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then our Saviour does not know the end and the ultimate blessedness. But He says the angels do not know;[fn-27-P2702_908562:46-nf] that is to say, not even the contemplation which is in them, nor the methods of their ministries are the ultimate object of desire. For even their knowledge, when compared with the knowledge which is face to face, is dense.[fn-27-P2703_908806:47-nf] Only the Father, He says, knows, since He is Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer know God in mirrors and not immediately,[fn-27-P2704_909839:48-nf] but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall know even the ultimate end. For all material knowledge is said to be the kingdom of Christ; while immaterial knowledge, and so to say the knowledge of actual Godhead, is that of God the Father. But our Lord is also Himself the end anti the ultimate blessedness according to the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the Gospel? \"I will raise him up at the last day.\"[fn-27-P2705_910453:49-nf] He calls the transition from material knowledge to immaterial contemplation a resurrection, speaking of that knowledge after which there is no other, as the last day: for our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at the time when it contemplates the One-ness and Unity of the Word. But since our intelligence is made dense and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and incapable of gazing intently in pure contemplation, being led through adornments[fn-27-P2706_910957:50-nf] cognate to its own body. It considers the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by their effects, to the end that growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to approach even the actual unveiled Godhead. This is the meaning, I think, of the words \"my Father is greater than I,\"[fn-27-P2707_911834:51-nf] and also of the statement, \"It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.\"[fn-27-P2708_911957:52-nf] This too is what is meant by Christ's \"delivering up the kingdom to God even the Father;\"[fn-27-P2709_912091:53-nf] inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is regarded relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first fruits. It is in accordance with this view that when His disciples asked Him again in the Acts of the Apostles, \"When wilt thou restore the kingdom of Israel?\" He replied, \"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.\"[fn-27-P2710_912532:54-nf] That is to say, the knowledge of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and blood. This contemplation the Father hath put away in His own power, meaning by \"power\" those that are empowered, and by \"His own\" those who are not held down by the ignorance of things below. Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain distinctions of knowledge made by the sun apprehended by mental perception. For our Lord's prayer must be carried out. It is Jesus Who prayed \"Grant that they may be one in us as I and Thou are one, Father.\"[fn-27-P2711_913115:55-nf] For when God, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and number is lost in the in-dwelling of Unity.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":13,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_40_letter_xxii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3.

Now the proper way to direct our investigation seems to me to be as follows. We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, \"But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.\"[fn-31-P3112_1012024:7-nf] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God;[fn-31-P3113_1012350:8-nf] for we are taught by Holy Scripture that \"All things were made by Him,\"[fn-31-P3114_1012794:9-nf] and \"by Him consist.\"[fn-31-P3115_1012831:10-nf] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.[fn-31-P3116_1013067:11-nf] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,[fn-31-P3117_1013181:12-nf] which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":13,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_83_letter_lxv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"IF I continue to insist on the privileges to which my superior age entitles me, and wait for you to take the initiative in communication , and if you, my friend, wish to adhere more persistently to your evil counsel of inaction, what end will there be to our silence?
