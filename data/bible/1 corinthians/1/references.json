Of astrologers there should be no speaking even;[fn-6-P681_289508:46-nf] but since one in these days has challenged us, defending on his own behalf perseverance in that profession, I will use a few words. I allege not that he honours idols, whose names he has inscribed on the heaven,[fn-6-P682_289767:47-nf] to whom he has attributed all God's power; because men, presuming that we are disposed of by the immutable arbitrament of the stars, think on that account that God is not to be sought after. One proposition I lay down: that those angels, the deserters from God, the lovers of women,[fn-6-P683_290093:48-nf] were likewise the discoverers of this curious art, on that account also condemned by God. Oh divine sentence, reaching even unto the earth in its vigour, whereto the unwitting render testimony! The astrologers are expelled just like their angels. The city and Italy are interdicted to the astrologers, just as heaven to their angels.[fn-6-P684_290622:49-nf] There is the same penalty of exclusion for disciples and masters. \"But Magi and astrologers came from the east.\"[fn-6-P685_290777:50-nf] We know the mutual alliance of magic and astrology. The interpreters of the stars, then, were the first to announce Christ's birth the first to present Him \"gifts.\" By this bond, [must] I imagine, they put Christ under obligation to themselves? What then? Shall therefore the religion of those Magi act as patron now also to astrologers? Astrology now-a-days, forsooth, treats of Christ-is the science of the stars of Christ; not of Saturn, or Mars, and whomsoever else out of the same class of the dead[fn-6-P686_291300:51-nf] it pays observance to and preaches? But, however, that science has been allowed until the Gospel, in order that after Christ's birth no one should thence forward interpret any one's nativity by the heaven. For they therefore offered to the then infant Lord that frankincense and myrrh and gold, to be, as it were, the close of worldly[fn-6-P687_291773:52-nf] sacrifice and glory, which Christ was about to do away. What, then? The dream-sent, doubtless, of the will of God-suggested to the same Magi, namely, that they should go home, but by another way, not that by which they came. It means this: that they should not walk in their ancient path.[fn-6-P688_292084:53-nf] Not that Herod should not pursue them, who in fact did not pursue them; unwitting even that they had departed by another way, since be was withal unwitting by what way they came. Just so we ought to understand by it the right Way and Discipline. And so the precept was rather, that thence forward they should walk otherwise. So, too, that other species of magic which operates by miracles, emulous even in opposition to Moses,[fn-6-P689_292526:54-nf] tried God's patience until the Gospel. For thenceforward Simon Magus, just turned believer, (since he was still thinking somewhat of his juggling sect; to wit, that among the miracles of his profession he might buy even the gift of the Holy Spirit through imposition of hands) was cursed by the apostles, and ejected from the faith.[fn-6-P690_292910:55-nf] Both he and that other magician, who was with Sergius Paulus, (since he began opposing himself to the same apostles) was mulcted with loss of eyes.[fn-6-P691_293084:56-nf] The same fate, I believe, would astrologers, too, have met, if any had fallen in the way of the apostles. But yet, when magic is punished, of which astrology is a species, of course the species is condemned in the genus. After the Gospel, you will nowhere find either sophists, Chaldeans, enchanters, diviners, or magicians, except as clearly punished. \"Where is the wise, where the grammarian, where the disputer of this age? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this age? \"[fn-6-P692_293589:57-nf] You know nothing, astrologer, if you know not that you should be a Christian.

Hence also it follows by consequence, that the Apostle Paul did not say, \"Who alone has immortality,\" of the Father merely; but of the One and only God, which is the Trinity itself.

But the eternal life itself, of which we are made partakers, is one thing; we ourselves, who, by partaking of it, shall live eternally, are another.

Let us pass on to other passages, for the brief limits of a letter do not suffer us to dwell too long on any one point. The same Matthew says:-\"Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying, Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel.\"[fn-23-P2370_603399:1690-nf] The rendering of the Septuagint is, \"Behold a virgin shall receive seed and shall bring forth a son, and ye shall call his name Emmanuel.\" If people cavil at words, obviously `to receive seed' is not the exact equivalent of `to be with child,' and `ye shall call' differs from `they shall call.' Moreover in the Hebrew we read thus, \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel.\"[fn-23-P2371_603863:1691-nf] Ahaz shall not call him so for he was convicted of want of faith, nor the Jews for they were destined to deny him, but she who is to conceive him, and bear him, the virgin herself. In the same evangelist we read that Herod was troubled at the coming of the Magi and that gathering together the scribes and the priests he demanded of them where Christ should be born and that they answered him, \"In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet; And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a governour that shall rule my people Israel.\"[fn-23-P2372_604494:1692-nf] In the Vulgate[fn-23-P2373_604544:1693-nf] this passage appears as follows:-\"And thou Bethlehem, the house of Ephratah, art small to be among the thousands of Judah, yet one shall come out of thee for me to be a prince in Israel.\" You will be more surprised still at the difference in words and order between Matthew and the Septuagint if you look at the Hebrew which runs thus:-\"But thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.\"[fn-23-P2374_605157:1694-nf] Consider one by one the words of the evangelist:-\"And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah.\" For \"the land of Judah\" the Hebrew has \"Ephratah\" while the Septuagint gives \"the house of Ephratah.\" The evangelist writes, \"art not the least among the princes of Judah.\" In the Septuagint this is, \"art small to be among the thousands of Judah,\" while the Hebrew gives, \"though thou be little among the thousands of Judah.\" There is a contradiction here-and that not merely verbal-between the evangelist and the prophet; for in this place at any rate both Septuagint and Hebrew agree. The evangelist says that he is not little among the princes of Judah, while the passage from which he queries says exactly the opposite of this, \"Thou art small indeed and little; but yet out of thee, small and little as thou art, there shall come forth for me a leader in Israel,\" a sentiment in harmony with that of the apostle, \"God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.\"[fn-23-P2375_606175:1695-nf] Moreover the last clause \"to rule\" or \"to feed my people Israel\" clearly runs differently in the original.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"801","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. Let me use for a moment the language of philosophy. According to the Stoics there are four virtues so closely related and mutually coherent that he who lacks one lacks all. They are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.[fn-27-P2713_708762:1922-nf] While all of you possess the four, yet each is remarkable for one. You have prudence, your mother has justice, your virgin sister has fortitude, your wedded wife has temperance. I speak of you as wise, for who can be wiser than one who, despising the folly of the world, has followed Christ \"the power of God and the wisdom of God\"?[fn-27-P2714_709125:1923-nf] Or what better instance can there be of justice than your mother, who having divided her substance among her offspring has taught them by her own contempt of riches the true object on which to fix their affections? Who has set a better example of courage than Eustochium, who by resolving to be a virgin has breached the gates of the nobility and broken down the pride of a consular house? The first of Roman ladies, she has brought under the yoke the first of Roman families. Has there ever been temperance greater than that of Paulina, who, reading the words of the apostle: \"marriage is honourable in all and the bed unde filed,\"[fn-27-P2715_709781:1924-nf] and not presuming to aspire to the happiness of her virgin sister or the continence of her widowed mother, has preferred to keep to the safe track of a lower path rather than treading on air to lose herself in the clouds? When once she had entered upon the married state, her one thought day and night was that, as soon as her union should be blessed with offspring, she would live thenceforth in the second degree of chastity,[fn-27-P2716_710232:1925-nf] and","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"811","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8. \"If thou wilt be perfect,\" the Lord says, \"go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor.... and come and follow me.\"[fn-27-P2751_720395:1950-nf] If thou wilt be perfect. Great enterprises are always left to the free choice of those who hear of them. Thus the apostle refrains from making virginity a positive duty, because the Lord in speaking of eunuchs who had made themselves such for the kingdom of heaven's sake finally said: \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\"[fn-27-P2752_720758:1951-nf] For, to quote the apostle, \"it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.\"[fn-27-P2753_720898:1952-nf] If thou wilt be perfect. There is no compulsion laid upon you: if you are to win the prize it must be by the exercise of your own free will. If therefore you will to be perfect and desire to be as the prophets, as the apostles, as Christ Himself, sell not a part of your substance (lest the fear of want become an occasion of unfaithfulness, and so you perish with Ananias and Sapphira[fn-27-P2754_721305:1953-nf] ) but all that you have. And when you have sold all, give the proceeds not to the wealthy or to the high-minded but to the poor. Give each man enough for his immediate need but do not give money to swell what a man has already. \"Thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,\"[fn-27-P2755_721622:1954-nf] and \"the labourer is worthy of his reward.\"[fn-27-P2756_721689:1955-nf] Again \"they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar.\"[fn-27-P2757_721779:1956-nf] Remember also these words: \"having, food and raiment let us be therewith content.\"[fn-27-P2758_721886:1957-nf] Where you see smoking dishes, steaming pheasants, massive silver plate, spirited nags, long-haired boy-slaves, expensive clothing, and embroidered hangings, give nothing there. For he to whom you would give is richer than you the giver. It is moreover a kind of sacrilege to give what belongs to the poor to those who are not poor. Yet to be a perfect and complete Christian it is not enough to despise wealth or to squander and fling away one's money, a thing which can be lost and found in a single moment. Crates the Theban[fn-27-P2759_722437:1958-nf] did this, so did Antisthenes and several others, whose lives shew them to have had many faults. The disciple of Christ must do more for the attainment of spiritual glory than the philosopher of the world, than the venal slave of flying rumours and of the people's breath. It is not enough for you to despise wealth unless you follow Christ as well. And only he follows Christ who forsakes his sins and walks hand in hand with virtue. We know that Christ is wisdom. He is the treasure which in the scriptures a man finds in his field.[fn-27-P2760_722999:1959-nf] He is the peerless gem which is bought by selling many pearls.[fn-27-P2761_723087:1960-nf] But if you love a captive woman, that is, worldly wisdom, and if no beauty but hers attracts you, make her bald and cut off her alluring hair, that is to say, the graces of style, and pare away her dead nails.[fn-27-P2762_723322:1961-nf] Wash her with the nitre of which the prophet speaks,[fn-27-P2763_723414:1962-nf] and then take your ease with her and say \"Her left hand is under my head, and her right hand doth embrace me.\"[fn-27-P2764_723547:1963-nf] Then shall the captive bring to you many children; from a Moabitess[fn-27-P2765_723660:1964-nf] she shall become an Israelitish woman. Christ is that sanctification without which no man shall see the face of God. Christ is our redemption, for He is at once our Redeemer and our Ransom.[fn-27-P2766_723887:1965-nf] Christ is all, that he who has left all for Christ may find One in place of all, and may be able to proclaim freely. \"The Lord is my portion.\"[fn-27-P2767_724067:1966-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1112","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"19.

And the world passeth away and the lust thereof.\"[fn-40-P4070_1094003:2926-nf] I know that when word was sent to her of the serious illnesses of her children and particularly of Toxotius whom she dearly loved, she first by her self-control fulfilled the saying: \"I was troubled and I did not speak,\"[fn-40-P4071_1094254:2927-nf] and then cried out in the words of scripture, \"He that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\"[fn-40-P4072_1094389:2928-nf] And she prayed to the Lord and said: Lord \"preserve thou the children of those that are appointed to die,\"[fn-40-P4073_1094525:2929-nf] that is, of those who for thy sake every day die bodily. I am aware that a talebearer-a class of persons who do a great deal of harm-once told her as a kindness that owing to her great fervour in virtue some people thought her mad and declared that something should be done for her head. She replied in the words of the apostle, \"we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men,\"[fn-40-P4074_1094944:2930-nf] and \"we are fools for Christ's sake\"[fn-40-P4075_1095005:2931-nf] but \"the foolishness of God is wiser than men.\"[fn-40-P4076_1095076:2932-nf] It is for this reason she said that even the Saviour says to the Father, \"Thou knowest my foolishness,\"[fn-40-P4077_1095202:2933-nf] and again \"I am as a wonder unto many, but thou art my strong refuge.\"[fn-40-P4078_1095295:2934-nf] \"I was as a beast before thee; nevertheless I am continually with thee.\"[fn-40-P4079_1095409:2935-nf] In the gospel we read that even His kinsfolk desired to bind Him as one of weak mind.[fn-40-P4080_1095518:2936-nf] His opponents also reviled him saying \"thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil,\"[fn-40-P4081_1095621:2937-nf] and another time \"he casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.\"[fn-40-P4082_1095727:2938-nf] But let us, she continued, listen to the exhortation of the apostle, \"Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and sincerity ...by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the world.\"[fn-40-P4083_1095973:2939-nf] And let us hear the Lord when He says to His apostles, \"If ye were of the world the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world ...therefore the world hateth you.\"[fn-40-P4084_1096175:2940-nf] And then she turned to the Lord Himself, saying, \"Thou knowest the secrets of the heart,\"[fn-40-P4085_1096292:2941-nf] and \"all this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant; our heart is not turned back.\"[fn-40-P4086_1096470:2942-nf] \"Yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.\"[fn-40-P4087_1096587:2943-nf] But \"the Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.\"[fn-40-P4088_1096688:2944-nf] She had read the words of Solomon, \"My son, honour the Lord and thou shalt be made strong; and beside the Lord fear thou no man.\"[fn-40-P4089_1096847:2945-nf] These passages and others like them she used as God's armour against the assaults of wickedness, and particularly to defend herself against the furious onslaughts of envy; and thus by patiently enduring wrongs she soothed the violence of the most savage breasts. Down to the very day of her death two things were conspicuous in her life, one her great patience and the other the jealousy which was manifested towards her.

Therefore, if even he be bad, and he happen to have the ministration of baptism, and if men do not know him, but God knows him, God, who has kept the power to Himself, permits baptism to be administered through him.","title":"Tractate V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"136","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now a good deal may be said of men's strange vocations,-either such as we have read about, or have experienced ourselves,-which go to overthrow the opinion of those persons who think that, previous to the possession of their bodies, men's souls passed through certain lives peculiar to themselves, in which they must come to this, and experience in the present life either good or evil, according to the difference of their individual deserts. My anxiety, however, to bring this work to an end does not permit me to dwell longer on these topics. But on one point, which among many I have found to be a very strange one, I will not be silent. If we follow those persons who suppose that souls are oppressed with earthly bodies in a greater or a less degree of grossness, according to the deserts of the life which had been passed in celestial bodies previous to the assumption of the present one, who would not affirm that those had sinned previous to this life with an especial amount of enormity, who deserve so to lose all mental light, that they are born with faculties akin to brute animals,-who are (I will not say most slow in intellect, for this is very commonly said of others also, but) so silly as to make a show of their fatuity for the amusement of clever people, even with idiotic gestures,[fn-4-P469_378740:99-nf] and whom the vulgar call, by a name, derived from the Greek, Morionej?[fn-4-P470_378990:100-nf] And yet there was once a certain person of this class, who was so Christian, that although he was patient to the degree of strange folly with any amount of injury to himself, he was yet so impatient of any insult to the name of Christ, or, in his own person, to the religion with which he was imbued, that he could never refrain, whenever his gay and clever audience proceeded to blaspheme the sacred name, as they sometimes would in order to provoke his patience, from pelting them with stones; and on these occasions he would show no favour even to persons of rank. Well, now, such persons are predestinated and brought into being, as I suppose, in order that those who are able should understand that God's grace and the Spirit, \"which bloweth where it listeth,\"[fn-4-P471_379804:101-nf] does not pass over any kind of capacity in the sons of mercy, nor in like manner does it pass over any kind of capacity in the children of Gehenna, so that \"he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-4-P472_380027:102-nf] They, however, who affirm that souls severally receive different earthly bodies, more or less gross according to the merits of their former life, and that their abilities as men vary according to the self-same merits, so that some minds are sharper and others more obtuse, and that the grace of God is also dispensed for the liberation of men from their sins according to the deserts of their former existence:-what will they have to say about this man? How will they be able to attribute to him a previous life of so disgraceful a character that he deserved to be born an idiot, and at the same time of so highly meritorious a character as to entitle him to a preference in the award of the grace of Christ over many men of the acutest intellect?","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_12_book_vi_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1. Some think themselves hindered from admitting the equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, because it is written, \"Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God;\" in that, on this ground, there does not appear to be equality; because the Father is not Himself power and wisdom, but the begetter of power and wisdom. And, in truth, the question is usually asked with no common earnestness, in what way God can be called the Father of power and wisdom. For the apostle says, \"Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-11-P1108_450536:1-nf] And hence some on our side have reasoned in this way against the Arians, at least against those who at first set themselves up against the Catholic faith. For Arius himself is reported to have said, that if He is a Son, then He was born; if He was born, there was a time when the Son was not: not understanding that even to be born is, to God, from all eternity; so that the Son is co-eternal with the Father, as the brightness which is produced and is spread around by fire is co-eval with it, and would be co-eternal, if fire were eternal. And therefore some of the later Arians have abandoned that opinion, and have confessed that the Son of God did not begin to be in time. But among the arguments which those on our side used to hold against them who said that there was a time when the Son was not, some were wont to introduce such an argument as this: If the Son of God is the power and wisdom of God, and God was never without power and wisdom, then the Son is co-eternal with God the Father; but the apostle says, \"Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God;\" and a man must be senseless to say that God at any time had not power or wisdom; therefore there was no time when the Son was not.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"6. We acknowledge that the word of truth has in many places made use of these expressions; yet we absolutely deny that the freedom of the Spirit is in bondage to the pettiness of Paganism. On the contrary, we maintain that Scripture varies its expressions as occasion requires, according to the circumstances of the case. For instance, the phrase \"of which\" does not always and absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material,[fn-11-P1166_275824:20-nf] but it is more in accordance with the usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause, as in the words \"One God, of whom are all things,\"[fn-11-P1167_276074:21-nf] and again, \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1168_276783:22-nf] The word of truth has, however, frequently used this term in the case of the material, as when it says \"Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;\"[fn-11-P1169_276955:23-nf] and \"Thou shall make the candlestick of pure gold ;\"[fn-11-P1170_277028:24-nf] and \"The first man is of the earth, earthy;[fn-11-P1171_277426:25-nf] and \"Thou art formed out of clay as I am.\"[fn-11-P1172_277487:26-nf] But these men, to the end, as we have already remarked, that they may establish the difference of nature, have laid down the law that this phrase befits the Father alone. This distinction they have originally derived from heathen authorities, but here they have shewn no faithful accuracy of limitation. To the Son they have in conformity with the teaching of their masters given the title of instrument, and to the Spirit that of place, for they say in the Spirit, and through the Son. But when they apply \"of whom\" to God they no longer follow heathen example, but \"go over, as they say, to apostolic usage, as it is said, \"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,\"[fn-11-P1173_278169:27-nf] and \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1174_278219:28-nf] What, then, is the result of this systematic discussion? There is one nature of Cause; another of Instrument; another of Place.

It will follow that we should next in order point out the character of the provision of blessings bestowed on us by the Father \"through him.\" Inasmuch as all created nature, both this visible world and all that is conceived of in the mind, cannot hold together without the care and providence of God, the Creator Word, the Only begotten God, apportioning His succour according to the measure of the needs of each, distributes mercies various and manifold on account of the many kinds and characters of the recipients of His bounty, but appropriate to the necessities of individual requirements. Those that are confined in the darkness of ignorance He enlightens: for this reason He is true Light.[fn-13-P1354_322518:171-nf] Portioning requital in accordance with the desert of deeds, He judges: for this reason He is righteous Judge.[fn-13-P1355_322649:172-nf] \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.\"[fn-13-P1356_322744:173-nf] Those that have lapsed from the lofty height of life into sin He raises from their fall: for this reason He is Resurrection.[fn-13-P1357_322890:174-nf] Effectually working by the much of His power and the will of His goodness He does all things.

Thus the good things that come from God reach us \"through the Son,\" who works in each case with greater speed than speech can utter. For not lightnings, not light's course in air, is so swift; not eyes' sharp turn, not the movements of our very thought. Navy by the divine energy is each one of these in speed further surpassed than is the slowest of all living creatures outdone in motion by birds, or even winds, or the rush of the heavenly bodies: or, not to mention these, by our very thought itself.

Let us now inquire more carefully, so far as God grants, into that which a little before we deferred; whether each person also in the Trinity can also by Himself and not with the other two be called God, or great, or wise, or true, or omnipotent, or just, or anything else that can be said of God, not relatively, but absolutely; or whether these things cannot be said except when the Trinity is understood. For the question is raised,-because it is written, \"Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,\"[fn-11-P1172_484349:1-nf] -whether He is so the Father of His own wisdom and His own power, as that He is wise with that wisdom which He begat, and powerful with that power which He begat; and whether, since He is always powerful and wise, He always begat power and wisdom. For if it be so, then, as we have said, why is He not also the Father of His own greatness by which He is great, and of His own goodness by which He is good, and of His own justice by which He is just, and whatever else there is? Or if all these things are understood, although under more names than one, to be in the same wisdom and power, so that that is greatness which is power, that is goodness which is wisdom, and that again is wisdom which is power, as we have already argued; then let us remember, that when I mention any one of these, I am to be taken as if I mentioned all. It is asked, then, whether the Father also by Himself is wise, and is Himself His own wisdom itself; or whether He is wise in the same way as He speaks. For He speaks by the Word which He begat, not by the word which is uttered, and sounds, and passes away, but by the Word which was with God, and the Word was God, and all things were made by Him:[fn-11-P1173_485548:2-nf] by the Word which is equal to Himself, by whom He always and unchangeably utters Himself. For He is not Himself the Word, as He is not the Son nor the image. But in speaking (putting aside those words of God in time which are produced in the creature, for they sound and pass away,-in speaking then) by that co-eternal Word, He is not understood singly, but with that Word itself, without whom certainly He does not speak. Is He then in such way wise as He is one who speaks, so as to be in such way wisdom, as He is the Word, and so that to be the Word is to be wisdom, that is, also to be power, so that power and wisdom and the Word may be the same, and be so called relatively as the Son and the image: and that the Father is not singly powerful or wise, but together with the power and wisdom itself which He begat (genuit); just as He is not singly one who speaks, but by that Word and together with that Word which He begat; and in like way great by that and together with that greatness, which He begat? And if He is not great by one thing, and God by another, but great by that whereby He is God, because it is not one thing to Him to be great and another to be God; it follows that neither is He God singly, but by that and together with that deity (deitas) which He begat; so that the Son is the deity of the Father, as He is the wisdom and power of the Father, and as He is the Word and image of the Father. And because it is not one thing to Him to be, another to be God, the Son is also the essence of the Father, as He is His Word and image. And hence also-except that He is the Father [the Unbegotten]-the Father is not anything unless because He has the Son; so that not only that which is meant by Father (which it is manifest He is not called relatively to Himself but to the Son, and therefore is the Father because He has the Son), but that which He is in respect to His own substance is so called, because He begat His own essence. For as He is great, only with that greatness which He begat, so also He is, only with that essence which He begat; because it is not one thing to Him to be, and another to be great. Is He therefore the Father of His own essence, in the same way as He is the Father of His own greatness, as He is the Father of His own power and wisdom? since His greatness is the same as His power, and His essence the same as His greatness.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_13_book_vii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"4. Why, then, is scarcely anything ever said in the Scriptures of wisdom, unless to show that it is begotten or created of God?-begotten in the case of that Wisdom by which all things are made; but created or made, as in men, when they are converted to that Wisdom which is not created anti made but begotten, and are so enlightened; for in these men themselves there comes to be something which may be called their wisdom: even as the Scriptures foretell or narrate, that \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;\"[fn-11-P1182_499909:4-nf] for in this way Christ was made wisdom, because He was made man. Is it on this account that wisdom does not speak in these books, nor is anything spoken of it, except to declare that it is born of God, or made by Him (although the Father is Himself wisdom), namely, because wisdom ought to be commended and imitated by us, by the imitation of which we are fashioned [rightly]? For the Father speaks it, that it may be His Word: yet not as a word producing a sound proceeds from the mouth, or is thought before it is pronounced. For this word is completed in certain spaces of time, but that is eternal, and speaks to us by enlightening us, what ought to be spoken to men, both of itself and of the Father. And therefore He says, \"No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father. save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him:\"[fn-11-P1183_500791:5-nf] since the Father reveals by the Son, that is, by His Word. For if that word which we utter, and which is temporal and transitory, declares both itself, and that of which we speak, how much more the Word of God, by which all things are made? For this Word so declares the Father as He is the Father; because both itself so is, and is that which is the Father, in so far as it is wisdom and essence. For in so far as it is the Word. it is not what the Father is: because the Word is not the Father, and Word is spoken relatively, as is also Son, which assuredly is not the Father. And therefore Christ is the power and wisdom of God, because He Himself, being also power and wisdom, is from the Father, who is power and wisdom; as He is light of the Father, who is light, and the fountain of life with God the Father, who is Himself assuredly the fountain of life. For \"with Thee,\" He says, \"is the fountain of life, and in Thy light shall we see light.\"[fn-11-P1184_501762:6-nf] Because, \"as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself:\"[fn-11-P1185_501880:7-nf] and, \"He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world:\" and this light, \"the Word,\" was \"with God;\" but \"the Word also was God;\"[fn-11-P1186_502050:8-nf] and \"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all:\"[fn-11-P1187_502121:9-nf] but a light that is not corporeal, but spiritual; yet not in such way spiritual, that it was wrought by illumination, as it was said to the apostles, \"Ye are the light of the world,\"[fn-11-P1188_502321:10-nf] but \"the light which lighteth every man,\" that very supreme wisdom itself who is God, of whom we now treat. The Son therefore is Wisdom of wisdom, namely the Father, as He is Light of light, and God of God; so that both the Father singly is light, and the Son singly is light; and the Father singly is God, and the Son singly is God: therefore the Father also singly is wisdom, and the Son singly is wisdom. And as both together are one light and one God, so both are one wisdom.

And yet you are not ashamed of doing so much harm, though you call yourself a lover of virtue and wisdom. Had you been true and faithful in this profession, you would have recognized Christ, the virtue of God and the wisdom of God, and would not, in the pride of vain science, have revolted from His wholesome humility. Nevertheless you acknowledge that the spiritual part of the soul can be purified by the virtue of chastity without the aid of those theurgic arts and mysteries which you wasted your time in learning. You even say, sometimes, that these mysteries do not raise the soul after death, so that, after the termination of this life, they seem to be of no service even to the part you call spiritual; and yet you recur on every opportunity to these arts, for no other purpose, so far as I see, than to appear an accomplished theurgist, and gratify those who are curious in illicit arts, or else to inspire others with the same curiosity. But we give you all praise for saying that this art is to be feared, both on account of the legal enactments against it, and by reason of the danger involved in the very practice of it. And would that in this, at least, you were listened to by its wretched votaries, that they might be withdrawn from entire absorption in it, or might even be preserved from tampering with it at all!

But that Christ is this mind you do not believe; for Him you despise on account of the body He took of a woman and the shame of the cross; for your lofty wisdom spurns such low and contemptible things, and soars to more exalted regions.

Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

But the whole system of salvation, as it is comprised in the maintenance of discipline, we see is being subverted by that interpretation which is affected by the opposite side. For if it is a Christian who, after wandering far from his Father, squanders, by living heathenishly, the \"substance\" received from God his Father,-(the substance), of course, of baptism-(the substance), of course, of the Holy Spirit, and (in consequence) of eternal hope; if, stripped of his mental \"goods,\" he has even handed his service over to the prince of the world[fn-14-P1416_398528:103-nf] -who else but the devil?-and by him being appointed over the business of \"feeding swine\"-of tending unclean spirits, to wit-has recovered his senses so as to return to his Father,-the result will be, that, not adulterers and fornicators, but idolaters, and blasphemers, and renegades, and every class of apostates, will by this parable make satisfaction to the Father; and in this way (it may) rather (be said that) the whole \"substance\" of the sacrament is most truly wasted away. For who will fear to squander what he has the power of afterwards recovering? Who will be careful to preserve to perpetuity what he will be able to lose not to perpetuity? Security in sin is likewise an appetite for it. Therefore the apostate withal will recover his former \"garment,\" the robe of the Holy Spirit; and a renewal of the \"ring,\" the sign and seal of baptism; and Christ will again be \"slaughtered; \"[fn-14-P1417_399474:104-nf] and he will recline on that couch from which such as are unworthily clad are wont to be lifted by the torturers, and cast away into darkness,[fn-14-P1418_399701:105-nf] -much more such as have been stripped. It is therefore a further step if it is not expedient, (any more than reasonable), that the story of the prodigal son should apply to a Christian. Wherefore, if the image of a \"son\" is not entirely suitable to a Jew either, our interpretation shall be simply governed with an eye to the object the Lord had in view. The Lord had come, of course, to save that which \"had perished; \"[fn-14-P1419_400152:106-nf] \"a Physician.\" necessary to \"the sick\" \"more than to the whole.\"[fn-14-P1420_400245:107-nf] This fact He was in the habit both of typifying in parables and preaching in direct statements. Who among men \"perishes,\" who falls from health, but he who knows not the Lord? Who is \"safe and sound,\" but he who knows the Lord? These two classes-\"brothers\" by birth-this parable also will signify. See whether the heathen have in God the Father the \"substance\" of origin, and wisdom, and natural power of Godward recognition; by means of which power the apostle withal notes that \"in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom knew not God,\"[fn-14-P1421_400834:108-nf] -(wisdom) which, of course, it had received originally from God. This (\"substance\"), accordingly, he \"squandered; \"having been cast by his moral habits far from the Lord, amid the errors and allurements and appetites of the world,[fn-14-P1422_401086:109-nf] where, compelled by hunger after truth,[fn-14-P1423_401142:110-nf] he handed himself over to the prince of this age. He set him over \"swine,\" to feed that flock familiar to demons,[fn-14-P1424_401278:111-nf] where he would not be master of a supply of vital food, and at the same time would see others (engaged) in a divine work, having abundance of heavenly bread. He remembers his Father, God; he returns to Him when he has been satisfied; he receives again the pristine \"garment,\"-the condition, to wit, which Adam by transgression had lost. The \"ring\" also he is then Wont to receive for the first time, wherewith, after being interrogated,[fn-14-P1425_401779:112-nf] he publicly seals the agreement of faith, and thus thenceforward feeds upon the \"fatness\" of the Lord's body,-the Eucharist, to wit. This will be the prodigal son, who never in days bygone was thrifty; who was from the first prodigal, because not from the first a Christian. Him withal, returning from the world to the Father's embraces, the Pharisees mourned over, in the persons of the \"publicans and sinners.\" And accordingly to this point alone the elder brother's envy is adapted: not because the Jews were innocent, and obedient to God, but because they envied the nation salvation; being plainly they who ought to have been \"ever with\" the Father. And of course it is immediately over the first calling of the Christian that the Jew groans, not over his second restoration: for the former reflects its rap even upon the heathen; but the latter, which takes place in the churches, is not known even to the Jews. I think that I have advanced interpretations more consonant with the subject-matter of the parables, and the congruity of things, and the preservation of disciplines. But if the view with which the opposite party is eager to mould the ewe, and the drachma, and the voluptuousness of the son to the shape of the Christian sinner, is that they may endow adultery and fornication with (the gift of) repentance; it will be fitting either that all other crimes equally capital should be conceded remissible, or else that their peers, adultery and fornication, should be retained inconcessible.","title":"VII.

Some other, then, it was to whom he willed the \"rebuke\" to be sufficient; if, that is, the fornicator had incurred not \"rebuke\" from his sentence, but \"condemnation.\" For I offer you withal, for your investigation, this very question: Whether there were in the first Epistle others, too, who \"wholly saddened\" the apostle by \"acting disorderly,\"[fn-14-P1469_425029:137-nf] and \"were wholly saddened\" by him, through incurring (his) \"rebuke,\" according to the sense of the second Epistle; of whom some particular one may in that (second Epistle) have received pardon.

The Father glorifies the Son; how? He is next nailed to the cross. Then what followed? The sun, instead of setting, fled. How so? It did not retire behind a cloud, but abandoned its appointed orbit, and all the elements of the world felt that same shock of the death of Christ. The stars in their courses, to avoid complicity in the crime, escaped by self-extinction from beholding the scene. What did the earth? It quivered beneath the burden of the Lord hanging on the tree, protesting that it was powerless to confine Him who was dying. Yet surely rock and stone will not refuse Him a resting-place.

Again, we must not repose so blind a confidence in human intellect as to imagine that we have complete knowledge of the objects of our thought, or that the ultimate problem is solved as soon as we have formed a symmetrical and consistent theory. Finite minds cannot conceive the Infinite; a being dependent for its existence upon another cannot attain to perfect knowledge either of its Creator or of itself, for its consciousness of self is coloured by its circumstances, and bounds are set which its perception cannot pass. Its activity is not self-caused, but due to the Creator, and a being dependent on a Creator[fn-11-P1173_718489:19-nf] has perfect possession of none of its faculties, since its origin lies outside itself. Hence by an inexorable law it is folly for that being to say that it has perfect knowledge of any matter; its powers have limits which it cannot modify, and only while it is under the delusion that its petty bounds are coterminous with infinity can it make the empty boast of possessing wisdom. For of wisdom it is incapable, its knowledge being limited to the range of its perception, and sharing the impotence of its dependent existence. And therefore this masquerade[fn-11-P1174_719070:20-nf] of a finite nature boasting that it possesses the wisdom Which springs only from infinite knowledge earns the scorn and ridicule of the Apostle, who calls its wisdom folly. He says, For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, not in the language of wisdom, lest the cross of Christ should be made void. Far the word of the cross is foolishness to then that are perishing, but unto them that are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the understanding of the prudent I will reject. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the enquirer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

By the custom of mankind the differences of worth are the measure of the amount of honour which each in authority receives; so that inferiors do not approach the lower magistracies in the same guise exactly as they do the sovereign, and the greater or less display of fear or reverence on their part indicates the greater or the less worshipfulness in the objects of it: in fact we may discover, in this disposition of inferiors, who are the specially honourable; when, for instance, we see some one feared beyond his neighbours, or the recipient of more reverence than the rest. But in the case of the divine nature, because every perfection in the way of goodness is connoted with the very name of God, we cannot discover, at all events as we look at it, any ground for degrees of honour. Where there is no greater and smaller in power, or glory, or wisdom, or love, or of any other imaginable good whatever, but the good which the Son has is the Father's also, and all that is the Father's is seen in the Son, what possible state of mind can induce us to show the more reverence in the case of the Father?

Let us pass to the next point of his statement. He adds to what he had already said, \"Not standing in need, in the act of creation, of matter or parts or natural instruments: for He stands in need of nothing.\" This proposition, though Eunomius states it with a certain looseness of phrase, we yet do not reject as inconsistent with godly doctrine. For learning as we do that \"He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created[fn-10-P1053_571210:76-nf] ,\"we know that the Word is the Creator of matter, by that very act also producing with the matter the qualitiesof matter, so that for Him the impulse of Hisalmighty will was everything and instead of everything, matter, instrument, place, time, essence, quality, everything that is conceived in creation. For at one and the same time did He will that that which ought to be should be, and His power, that produced all things that are, kept pace with His will, turning His will into act. For thus the mighty Moses in the record of creation instructs us about the Divine power, ascribing the production of each of the objects that were manifested in the creation to the words that bade them be. For \"God said,\" he tells us, \"Let there be light, and there was light[fn-10-P1054_572021:77-nf] :\" and so about the rest, without any mention either of matter or of any instrumental agency. Accordingly the language of Eunomius on this point is not to be rejected. For God, when creating all things that have their origin by creation, neither stood in need of any matter on which to operate, nor of instruments to aid Him in His construction: for the power and wisdom of God has no need of any external assistance. But Christ is \"the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-10-P1055_572509:78-nf] ,\" by Whom all things were made and without Whom is no existent thing, as John testifies[fn-10-P1056_572617:79-nf] . If, then, all things were made by Him, both visible and invisible, and if His will alone suffices to effect the subsistence of existing things (for His will is power), Eunomius utters our doctrine though with a loose mode of expression[fn-10-P1057_572878:80-nf] . For what instrument and what matter could He Who upholds all thinsg by the word of His power[fn-10-P1058_573089:81-nf] need in upholding the constitution of existing things by His almighty word? But if he maintains that what we have believed to be true of the Only-begotten in the case of the creation, is true also in the case of the Son -in the sense that the Father created Him in like manner as the creation was made by the Son,-then we retract our former statement, because such a supposition is a denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten. For we have learnt from the mighty utterance of Paul that it is the distinguishing feature of idolatry to worship and serve the creature more than the Creator[fn-10-P1059_573733:82-nf] , as well as from David, when He says \"There shall no new God be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any alien God[fn-10-P1060_573869:83-nf] .\" We use this line and rule to arrive at the discernment of the object of worship, so as to be convinced that that alone is God which is neither \"new\" nor \"alien.\" Since then we have been taught to believe that the Only-begotten God is God, we acknowledge, by our belief that He is God, that He is neither \"new\" or \"alien.\" If, then, He is God, He is not \"new,\" and if He is not new, He is assuredly eternal. Accordingly, neither is the Eternal \"new,\" nor is He Who is of the Father and in the bosom of the Father and Who has the Father in Himself \"alien\" from true Deity. Thus he who severs the Son from the nature of the Father either absolutely disallows the worship of the Son, that he may not worship an alien God, or bows down before an idol, making a creature and not God the object of his worship, and giving to his idol the name of Christ.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now the drift of Eunomius' excessive concern about the Ungenerate has been often ex plained before; and it shall here be briefly discovered yet again. For as the term Father points to no difference of nature from the Son, his impiety, if he had brought his statement to a close here, would have had no support, seeing that the natural sense of the names Father and Son excludes the idea of their being alien in essence. But as it is, by employing the terms \"generate\" and \"ungenerate,\" since the contradictory opposition between them admits of no mean, just like that between \"mortal\" and \"immortal,\" \"rational\" and \"irrational,\" and all those terms which are opposed to each other by the mutually exclusive nature of their meaning,-by the use of these terms, I repeat, he gives free course to his profanity, so as to contemplate as existing in the \"generate\" with reference to the \"ungenerate\" the same difference which there is between \"mortal\" and \"immortal\": and even as the nature of the mortal is one, and that of the immortal another, and as the special attributes of the rational and of the irrational are essentially incompatible, just so he wants to make out that the nature of the ungenerate is one, and that of the generate another, in order to show that as the irrational nature has been created in subjection to the rational, so the generate is by a necessity of its being in a state of subordination to the ungenerate. For which reason he attaches to the ungenerate the name of \"Almighty,\" and this he does not apply to express providential operation, as the argument led the way for him in suggesting, but transfers the application of the word to arbitrary sovereignty, so as to make the Son to be a part of the subject and subordinate universe, a fellow-slave with all the rest to Him Who with arbitrary and absolute sovereignty controls all alike. And that it is with an eye to this result that he employs these argumentative distinctions, will be clearly established from the passage before us. For after those sapient and carefully-considered expressions, that He is not like either as Father to Father, or as Son to Son,-and yet there is no necessity that father should invariably be like father or son like son: for suppose there is one father among the Ethiopians, and another among the Scythians, and each of these has a son, the Ethiopian's son black, but the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge, yet none the more because each is a father does the Scythian turn black on the Ethiopian's account, nor does the Ethiopian's body change to white on account of the Scythian,-after saying this, however, according to his own fancy, Eunomius subjoins that \"He is like as Son to Father[fn-11-P1182_645287:176-nf] .\" But although such a phrase indicates kinship in nature, as the inspired Scripture attests in the case of Seth and Adam, our doctor, with but small respect for his intelligent readers, introduces his idle exposition of the title \"Son,\" defining Him to be the image and seal of the energy[fn-11-P1183_645670:177-nf] of the Almighty. \"For the Son,\" he says, \"is the image and seal of the energy of the Almighty.\" Let him who hath ears to hear first, I pray, consider this particular point-What is \"the seal of the energy\"? Every energy is contemplated as exertion in the party who exhibits it, and on the completion of his exertion, it has no independent existence. Thus, far example, the energy of the runner is the motion of his feet, and when the motion has stopped there is no longer any energy. So too about every pursuit the same may be said;-when the exertion of him who is busied about anything ceases, the energy ceases also, and has no independent existence, either when a person is actively engaged in the exertion he undertakes, or when he ceases from that exertion. What then does he tell us that the energy is in itself, which is neither essence, nor image, nor person? So he speaks of the Son as the similitude of the impersonal, and that which is like the non-existent surely has itself no existence at all. This is what his juggling with idle opinions comes to,-belief in nonentity! for that which is like nonentity surely itself is not. O Paul and John and all you others of the band of Apostles and Evangelists, who are they that arm their venomous tongues against your words? who are they that raise their frog-like croakings against your heavenly thunder? What then saith the son of thunder? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-11-P1184_647260:178-nf] .\" And what saith he that came after him, that other who had been within the heavenly temple, who in Paradise had been initiated into mysteries unspeakable? \"Being,\" he says, \"the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His person[fn-11-P1185_647522:179-nf] .\" What, after these have thus spoken, are the words of our ventriloquist[fn-11-P1186_647614:180-nf] ? \"The seal,\" quoth he, \"of the energy of the Almighty.\" He makes Him third after the Father, with that non-existent energy mediating between them, or rather moulded at pleasure by non-existence. God the Word, Who was in the beginning, is \"the seal of the energy\":-the Only-begotten God, Who is contemplated in the eternity of the Beginning of existent things, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-11-P1187_648087:181-nf] , Who sustains all things, by the word of His power[fn-11-P1188_648161:182-nf] , the creator of the ages, from Whom and through Whom and in Whom are all things[fn-11-P1189_648264:183-nf] , Who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and hath meted out heaven with the span, Who measureth the water in the hollow of his hand[fn-11-P1190_648423:184-nf] , Who holdeth in His hand all things that are, Who dwelleth on high and looketh upon the things that are lowly[fn-11-P1191_648561:185-nf] , or rather did look upon them to make all the world to be His footstool[fn-11-P1192_648662:186-nf] , imprinted by the footmark of the Word-the form of God[fn-11-P1193_648744:187-nf] is \"the seal\" of an \"energy.\" Is God then an energy, not a Person? Surely Paul when expounding this very truth says He is \"the express image,\" not of His energy, but \"of His Person.\" Is the Brightness of His glory a seal of the energy of God? Alas for his impious ignorance! What is there intermediate between God and His own form? and Whom does the Person employ as mediator with His own express image? and what can be conceived as coming between the glory and its brightness? But while there are such weighty and numerous testimonies wherein the greatness of the Lord of the creation is proclaimed by those who were entrusted with the proclamation of the Gospel, what sort of language does this forerunner of the final apostasy hold concerning Him? What says he? \"As image,\" he says, \"and seal of all the energy and power of the Almighty.\" How does he take upon himself to emend the words of the mighty Paul? Paul says that the Son is \"the Power of God[fn-11-P1194_649722:188-nf] \"; Eunomius calls Him \"the seal of a power,\" not the Power. And then, repeating his expression, what is it that he adds to his previous statement? He calls Him \"seal of the Father's works and words and counsels.\" To what works of the Father is He like? He will say, of course, the world, and all things that are therein. But the Gospel has testified that all these things are the works of the Only-begotten. To what works of theFather, then, was He likened? of what works was He made the seal? what Scripture ever entitled Him \"seal of the Father's works\"? But if any one should grant Eunomius the right to fashion his words at his own will, as he desires, even though Scripture does not agree with him, let him tell us what works of the Father there are of which he says that the Son was made the seal, apart from those that have been wrought by the Son. All things visible and invisible are the work of the Son: in the visible are included the whole world and all that is therein; in the invisible, the supramundane creation. What works of the Father, then, are remaining to be contemplated by themselves, over and above things visible and invisible, whereof he says that the Son was made the \"seal\"? Will he perhaps, when driven into a corner, return once more to the fetid vomit of heresy, and say that the Son is a work of the Father? How then does the Son come to be he seal of these works when He Himself, as Eunomius says, is the work of the Father? Or does he say that the same Person is at once a work and the likeness of a work? Let this be granted: let us suppose him to speak of the other works of which he says the Father was the creator, if indeed he intends us to understand likeness by the term \"seal.\" But what other \"words\" of the Father does Eunomius know, besides that Word Who was ever in the Father, Whom he calls a \"seal\"-Him Who is and is called the Word in the absolute, true, and primary sense? And to what counsels can he possibly refer, apart from the Wisdom of God, to which the Wisdom of God is made like, in becoming a \"seal\" of those counsels? Look at the want of discrimination and circumspection, at the confused muddle of his statement, how he brings the mystery into ridicule, without understanding either what he says or what he is arguing about. For He Who has the Father in His entirety in Himself, and is Himself in His entirety in the Father, as Word and Wisdom and Power and Truth, as His express image and brightness, Himself is all things in the Father, and does not come to be the image and seal and likeness of certain other things discerned in the Father prior to Himself.

What, then, is the righteousness by which the devil was conquered? What,except the righteousness of Jesus Christ? And how was he conquered? Because, when he found in Him nothing worthy of death, yet he slew Him. And certainly it is just, that we whom he held as debtors, should be dismissed free by believing in Him whom he slew without any debt. In this way it is that we are said to be justified in the blood of Christ.[fn-16-P1685_840544:30-nf] For so that innocent blood was shed for the remission of our sins. Whence He calls Himself in the Psalms, \"Free among the dead.\"[fn-16-P1686_840689:31-nf] For he only that is dead is free from the debt of death. Hence also in another psalm Hesays, \"Then I restored that which I seized not;\"[fn-16-P1687_840847:32-nf] meaning sin by the thing seized, because sin is laid hold of against what is lawful. Whence also He says, by the mouth of His own Flesh, as is read in the Gospel: \"For the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,\" that is, no sin; but \"that the world may know,\" He says, \"that I do the commandment of the Father; arise, let us go hence.\"[fn-16-P1688_841215:33-nf] And hence He proceeds to His passion, that He might pay for us debtors that which He Himself did not owe. Would then the devil be conquered by this most just right, if Christ had willed to deal with him by power, not by righteousness? But He held back what was possible to Him, in order that He might first do what was fitting. And hence it was necessary that He should be both man and God. For unless He had been man, He could not have been slain; unless He had been God. men would not have believed that He would not do what He could, but that He could not do what He would; nor should we have thought that righteousness was preferred by Him to power, but that He lacked power. But now He suffered for us things belonging to man, because He was man; but if He had been unwilling, it would have been in His power to not so to suffer, because He was also God. And righteousness was therefore made more acceptable in humility, because so great power as was in His Divinity, if He had been unwilling, would have been able not to suffer humility; and thus by Him who died, being thus powerful, both righteousness was commended, and power promised, to us, weak mortals. For He did one of these two things by dying, the other by rising again. For what is more righteous, than to come even to the death of the cross for righteousness? And what more powerful, than to rise from the dead, and to ascend into heaven with that very flesh in which He was slain? And therefore He conquered the devil first by righteousness, and afterwards by power: namely, by righteousness, because He had no sin, and was slain by him most unjustly; but by power, because having been dead He lived again, never afterwards to die.[fn-16-P1689_842939:34-nf] But He would have conquered the devil by power, even though He could not have been slain by him: although it belongs to a greater power to conquer death itself also by rising again, than to avoid it by living. But the reason is really a different one, why we are justified in the blood of Christ, when we are rescued from the power of the devil through the remission of sins: it pertains to this, that the devil is conquered by Christ by righteousness, not by power. For Christ was crucified, not through immortal power, but through the weakness which He took upon Him in mortal flesh; of which weakness nevertheless the apostle says, \"that the weakness of God is stronger than men.\"[fn-16-P1690_843640:35-nf] ","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Perhaps that passage in the Proverbs might be brought forward against us which the champions of heresy are wont to cite as a testimony that the Lord was created-the passage, \"The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-13-P1327_716277:13-nf] .\" For because these words are spoken by Wisdom, and the Lord is called Wisdom by the great Paul[fn-13-P1328_716441:14-nf] , they allege this passage as though the Only-begotten God Himself, under the name of Wisdom, acknowledges that He was created by the Maker of all things. I imagine, however, that the godly sense of this utterance is clear to moderately attentive and painstaking persons, so that, in the case of those who are instructed in the dark sayings of the Proverbs, no injury is done to the doctrine of the faith. Yet I think it well briefly to discuss what is to be said on this subject, that when the intention of this passage is more clearly explained, the heretical doctrine may have no room for boldness of speech on the ground that it has evidence in the writing of the inspired author. It is universally admitted that the name of \"proverb,\" in its scriptural use, is not applied with regard to the evident sense, but is used with a view to some hidden meaning, as the Gospel thus gives the name of \"proverbs[fn-13-P1329_717367:15-nf] \" to dark and obscure sayings; so that the \"proverb,\" if one were to set forth the interpretation of the name by a definition, is a form of speech which, by means of one set of ideas immediately presented, points to something else which is hidden, or a form of speech which does not point out the aim of the thought directly, but gives its instruction by an indirect signification. Now to this book such a name is especially attached as a title, and the force of the appellation is at once interpreted in the preface by the wise Solomon. For he does not call the sayings in this book \"maxims,\" or \"counsels,\" or \"clear instruction,\" but \"proverbs,\" and proceeds to add an explanation. What is the force of the signification of this word? \"To know,\" he tells us, \"wisdom and instruction[fn-13-P1330_718183:16-nf] \"; not setting before us the course of instruction in wisdom according to the method common in other kinds of learning; he bids a man, on the other hand[fn-13-P1331_718353:17-nf] , first to become wise by previous training, and then so to receive the instruction conveyed by proverb. For he tells us that there are \"words of wisdom\" which reveal their aim \"by a turn[fn-13-P1332_718590:18-nf] .\" For that which is not directly understood needs some turn for the apprehension of the thing concealed; and as Paul, when about to exchange the literal sense of the history for figurative contemplation, says that he will \"change his voice[fn-13-P1333_718859:19-nf] ,\" so here the manifestation of the hidden meaning is called by Solomon a \"turn of the saying,\" as if the beauty of the thoughts could not be perceived, unless one were to obtain a view of the revealed brightness of the thought by turning the apparent meaning of the saying round about, as happens with the plumage with which the peacock is decked behind.

Since then there is no beauty in what is obvious in the saying (for \"all the glory of the king's daughter is within[fn-13-P1334_719744:20-nf] ,\" shining with its hidden ornament in golden thoughts), Solomon of necessity suggests to the readers of this book \"the turn of the saying,\" that thereby they may \"understand a parable and a dark saying, words of the wise and riddles[fn-13-P1335_720003:21-nf] .\" Now as this proverbial teaching embraces these elements, a reasonable man will not receive any passage cited from this book, be it never so clear and intelligible at first sight, without examination and inspection; for assuredly there is some mystical contemplation underlying even those passages which seem manifest.

For seeing that it is clear to all that God Who is over all has in Himself nothing as a thing created or imported, not power nor wisdom, nor light, nor word, nor life, nor truth, nor any at all of those things which are contemplated in the fulness of the Divine bosom (all which things the Only-begotten God is, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-13-P1357_732908:39-nf] , the name of \"creation\" could not properly be applied to any of those things which are contemplated in God, so that the Son Who is in the Father, or the Word Who is in the Beginning, or the Light Who is in the Light, or the Life Who is in the Life, or the Wisdom Who is in the Wisdom, should say, \"the Lord created me.\" For if the Wisdom of God is created (and Christ is the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-13-P1358_733339:40-nf] ), God, it would follow, has His Wisdom as a thing imported, receiving afterwards, as the result of making, something which He had not at first. But surely He Who is in the bosom of the Father does not permit us to conceive the bosom of the Father as ever void of Himself. He Who is in the beginning is surely not of the things which come to be in that bosom from without, but being the fulness of all good, He is conceived as being always in the Father, not waiting to arise in Him as the result of creation, so that the Father should not be conceived as at any time void of good, but He Who is conceived as being in the eternity of the Father's Godhead is always in Him, being Power, and Life, and Truth, and Wisdom, and the like. Accordingly the words \"created me\" do not proceed from the Divine and immortal nature, but from that which was commingled with it in the Incarnation from our created nature. How comes it then that the same, called wisdom, and understanding, and intelligence, establishes the earth, and prepares the heavens, and breaks up the deeps, and yet is here \"created for the beginning of His works[fn-13-P1359_734481:41-nf] \"? Such a dispensation, he tells us, is not set forward without great cause. But since men, after receiving the commandment of the things we should observe, cast away by disobedience the grace of memory, and became forgetful, for this cause, \"that I may declare to you the things that happen day by day for your salvation, and may put you in mind by recounting the things from everlasting, which you have forgotten (for it is no new gospel that I now proclaim, but I labour at your restoration to your first estate),-for this cause I was created, Who ever am, and need no creation in order to be; so that I am the beginning of ways for the works of God, that is for men. For the first way being destroyed, there must needs again be consecrated for the wanderers a new and living way[fn-13-P1360_735336:42-nf] , even I myself, Who am the way.\" And this view, that the sense of \"created me\" has reference to the Humanity, the divine apostle more clearly sets before us by his own words when he charges us, \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ[fn-13-P1361_735585:43-nf] ,\" and also where (using the same word) he says, \"Put on the new man which after God is created[fn-13-P1362_735701:44-nf] \" For if the garment of salvation is one, and that is Christ, one cannot say that \"the new man, which after God is created,\" is any other than Christ, but it is clear that he who has \"put on Christ\" has \"put on the new man which after God is created.\" For actually He alone is properly named \"the new man,\" Who did not appear in the life of man by the known and ordinary ways of nature, but in His case alone creation, in a strange and special form, was instituted anew. For this reason he haines the same Person, when regarding the wonderful manner of His birth[fn-13-P1363_736282:45-nf] , \"the new man, which after God is created,\" and, when looking to the Divine nature, which was blended[fn-13-P1364_736401:46-nf] in the creation of this \"new man,\" he calls Him \"Christ\": so that the two names (I mean the name of \"Christ\" and the name of \"the new man which after God is created\") are applied to one and the same Person,","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_13_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"44.

The Apostle's confession asserts the genuineness of the relation. I see not how the Divine nature of the Son could have been more completely stated. That Chosen Vessel has proclaimed in no weak or wavering voice that Christ is the Son of Him Who, as we believe, is the Father. The Teacher of the Gentiles, the Apostle of Christ, has left us no uncertainty, no opening for error in his presentation of the doctrine. He is quite clear upon the Subject of children by adoption; of those who by faith attain so to be and so to be named. in his own words, For as many as are led by tire Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

This is the name granted to us, who believe, through the sacrament of regeneration; our confession of the faith wins us this adoption. For our work done in obedience to the Spirit of God gives us the title of sons of God. Abba, Father, is the cry which we raise, not the expression of our essential nature. For that essential nature of ours is untouched by that tribute of the voice. It is one thing for God to be addressed as Father; another thing for Him to be the Father of His Son.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1. We must now discourse concerning wisdom; not the wisdom of God, which without doubt is God, for His only-begotten Son is called the wisdom of God;[fn-17-P1747_871228:1-nf] but we will speak of the wisdom of man, yet of true wisdom, which is according to God, and is His true and chief worship, which is called in Greek by one term, qeoseÿ\\ia. And this term, as we have already observed, when our own countrymen themselves also wished to interpret it by a single term, was by them rendered piety, whereas piety means more commonly what the Greeks call eusebeia. But because qeosebeia cannot be translated perfectly by any one word, it is better translated by two,so as to render it rather by \"the worship ofGod.\" That this is the wisdom of man, aswe have already laid down in the twelfth book[fn-17-P1748_871886:2-nf] of this work, is shown by the authorityof Holy Scripture, in the book of God's servant Job, where we read that the Wisdom of God said to man, \"Behold piety, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is knowledge;\"[fn-17-P1749_872108:3-nf] or, as some have translated the Greek word episuhmhn, \"learning,\"[fn-17-P1750_872193:4-nf] which certainly takes its name from learning,[fn-17-P1751_872261:5-nf] whence also it may be called knowledge. For everything is learned in order that it may be known. Although the same word, indeed,[fn-17-P1752_872412:6-nf] is employed in a different sense, where any one suffers evils for his sins, that he may be corrected. Whence is that in the Epistle to the Hebrews, \"For what son is he to whom the father giveth not discipline?\" And this is still more apparent in the same epistle: \"Now no chastening[fn-17-P1753_872710:7-nf] for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.\"[fn-17-P1754_872889:8-nf] Therefore God Himself is the chiefest wisdom; but the worship of God is the wisdom of man, of which we now speak. For \"the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.\"[fn-17-P1755_873077:9-nf] It is in respect to this wisdom, therefore, which is the worship of God, that Holy Scripture says, \"The multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world.\"[fn-17-P1756_873253:10-nf] ","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-04","text":"2. If, because injustice is not from God, but from the devil, and persecution consists of injustice (for what more unjust than that the bishops of the true God, that all the followers of the truth, should be dealt with after the manner o the vilest criminals?), persecution therefore seems to proceed from the devil, by whom the injustice which constitutes persecution is perpetrated, we ought to know, as you have neither persecution without the injustice of the devil, nor the trial of faith without persecution, that the injustice necessary for the trial of faith does not give a warrant for persecution, but supplies an agency; that in reality, in reference to the trial of faith, which is the reason of persecution, the will of God goes first, but that as the instrument of persecution, which is the way of trial, the injustice of the devil follows. For in other respects, too, injustice in proportion to the enmity it displays against righteousness affords occasion for attestations of that to which it is opposed as an enemy, that so righteousness may be perfected in injustice, as strength is perfected in weakness.[fn-19-P1936_571808:4-nf] For the weak things of the world have been chosen by God to confound the strong, and the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom.[fn-19-P1937_571967:5-nf] Thus even injustice is employed, that righteousness may be approved in putting unrighteousness to shame. Therefore, since the service is not of free-will, but of subjection (for persecution is the appointment of the Lord for the trial of faith, but its ministry is the injustice of the devil, supplied that persecution may be got up), we believe that persecution comes to pass, no question, by the devil's agency, but not by the devil's origination. Satan will not be at liberty to do anything against the servants of the living God unless the Lord grant leave, either that He may overthrow Satan himself by the faith of the elect which proves victorious in the trial, or in the face of the world show that apostatizers to the devil's cause have been in reality His servants. You have the case of Job, whom the devil, unless he had received authority from God, could not have visited with trial, not even, in fact, in his property, unless the Lord had said, \"Behold, all that he has I put at your disposal; but do not stretch out your hand against himself.\"[fn-19-P1938_573046:6-nf] In short, he would not even have stretched it out, unless afterwards, at his request, the Lord had granted him this permission also, saying, \"Behold, I deliver him to you; only preserve his life.\" So he asked in the case of the apostles likewise an opportunity to tempt them, having it only by special allowance, since the Lord in the Gospel says to Peter, \"Behold, Satan asked that he might sift you as grain; but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not; \"[fn-19-P1939_573525:7-nf] that is, that the devil should not have power granted him sufficient to endanger his faith. Whence it is manifest that both things belong to God shaking of faith as well as the shielding of it, when both are sought from Him-the shaking by the devil, the shielding by the Son. And certainly, when the Son of God has faith's protection absolutely committed to Him, beseeching it of the Father, from whom He receives all power in heaven and on earth, how entirely out of the question is it that the devil should have the assailing of it in his own power! But in the prayer prescribed to us, when we say to our Father, \"Lead us not into temptation \"[fn-19-P1940_574193:8-nf] (now what greater temptation is there than persecution?), we acknowledge that that comes to pass by His will whom we beseech to exempt us from it. For this is what follows, \"But deliver us from the wicked one,\" that is, do not lead us into temptation by giving us up to the wicked one, for then are we delivered from the power of the devil, when we are not handed over to him to be tempted. Nor would the devil's legion have had power over the herd of swine[fn-19-P1941_574668:9-nf] unless they had got it from God; so far are they from having power over the sheep of God. I may say that the bristles of the swine, too, were then counted by God, not to speak of the hairs of holy men. The devil, it must be owned, seems indeed to have power-in this case really his own-over those who do not belong to God, the nations being once for all counted by God as a drop of the bucket, and as the dust of the threshing-floor, and as the spittle of the mouth, and so thrown open to the devil as, in a sense, a free possession. But against those who belong to the household of God he may not do ought as by any right of his own, because the cases marked out in Scripture show when-that is, for what reasons-he may touch them. For either, with a view to their being approved, the power of trial is granted to him, challenged or challenging, as in the instances already referred to, or, to secure an opposite result, the sinner is handed over to him, as though he were an executioner to whom belonged the inflicting of punishment, as in the case of Saul. \"And the Spirit of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled and stifled him; \"[fn-19-P1942_575871:10-nf] or the design is to humble, as the apostle tells us, that there was given him a stake, the messenger of Satan, to buffet him;[fn-19-P1943_576019:11-nf] and even this son of thing is not permitted in the case of holy men, unless it be that at the same time strength of endurance may be perfected in weakness. For the apostle likewise delivered Phygellus and Hermogenes over to Satan that by chastening they might be taught not to blaspheme.[fn-19-P1944_576327:12-nf] You see, then, that the devil receives more suitably power even from the servants of God; so far is he from having it by any fight of his own.","title":"IX.

Nothing is more harassing to human nature than the sense of impending danger. If calamities unknown or unanticipated befall us, we may need pity, yet we have been free from care; no load of anxiety has oppressed us. But he whose mind is full of possibilities of trouble suffers already a torment in his fear. I who now am venturing out to sea, am a mariner not unused to shipwreck, a traveller who knows by experience holy brigands lurk in the forests, an explorer of African deserts aware of the danger from scorpions and asps and basilisks[fn-15-P1520_963617:2-nf] . I enjoy no instant of relief from the knowledge and fear of present danger. Every heretic is on the watch, noting every word as it drops from my mouth. The whole progress of my argument is infested with ambuscades and pitfalls and snares. It is not of the road, of its hardness or steepness, that I complain; I am following in the footsteps of the Apostles, not choosing my own path. My trouble is the constant peril, the constant dread, of wandering into some ambush, of stumbling into some pit, of being entangled in some net. My purpose is to proclaim the unity of God, in the sense of the Law and Prophets and Apostles. Sabellius is at hand, eager with cruel kindness to welcome me, on the strength of this unity, and swallow me up in his own destruction. If I withstand him, and deny that, in the Sabellian sense, God is One a fresh heresy is ready to receive me, pointing out that I teach the existence of two Gods. Again, if I undertake to tell holy the Son of God was born from Mary, Photinus, the Ebion of our day, will be prompt to twist this assertion of the truth into a confirmation of his lie. I need mention no other heresies save one; all the world knows that they are alien from the Church. It is one that has been often denounced, often rejected, yet it preys upon our vitals still. Galatia[fn-15-P1521_964954:3-nf] has reared a large brood of godless assertors of the unity of God. Alexandria[fn-15-P1522_965056:4-nf] has sown broadcast, over almost the whole world, her denial, which is an affirmation, of the doctrine of two Gods. Pannonia[fn-15-P1523_965190:5-nf] upholds her pestilent doctrine that the only birth of Jesus Christ was from the Virgin. And the Church, distracted by these rival faiths, is in danger of being led by means of truth into a rejection of truth. Doctrines are being forced upon her for godless ends, which, according to the use that is made of them, will either support or overthrow the faith. For instance, we cannot, as true believers, assert that God is One, if we mean by it that He is alone; for faith in a lonely God denies the Godhead of the Son. If, on the other hand, we assert, as we truly can, that the Son is God, we are in danger, so they fondly imagine, of deserting the truth that God is One. We are in peril on either hand; we may deny the unity or we may maintain the isolation. But it is a danger which has no terrors for the foolish things of the word[fn-15-P1524_966048:6-nf] .

He frankly says, nay he protests, that he commends the gifts of God within himself, so that he glories not in himself at all, but in the Lord;[fn-30-P3025_1171180:113-nf] he not only declares that he possessed no good deserts in himself why he should be made an apostle, but he even mentions his own demerits, in order to manifest and preach the grace of God. \"I am not meet,\" says he, \"to be called an apostle;\"[fn-30-P3026_1171443:114-nf] and what else does this mean than \"I am not worthy\"-as indeed several Latin copies read the phrase. Now this, to be sure, is the very gist of our question; for undoubtedly in this grace of apostleship all those graces are contained. For it was neither convenient nor right that an apostle should not possess the gift of prophecy, nor be a teacher, nor be illustrious for miracles and the gifts of healings, nor furnish needful helps, nor provide governments over the churches, nor excel in diversities of tongues. All these functions the one name of apostleship embraces. Let us, therefore, consult the man himself, nay listen wholly to him. Let us say to him: \"Holy Apostle Paul, the monk Pelagius declares that thou wast worthy to receive all the graces of thine apostleship. What dost thou say thyself?\" He answers: \"I am not worthy to be called an apostle.\" Shall I then, under pretence of honouring Paul, in a matter concerning Paul, dare to believe Pelagius in preference to Paul? I will not do so; for if I did, I should only prove to be more onerous to myself than honouring to him.[fn-30-P3027_1172556:115-nf] Let us hear also why he is not worthy to be called an apostle: \"Because,\" says he, \"I persecuted the Church of God.\"[fn-30-P3028_1172775:116-nf] Now, were we to follow up the idea here expressed, who would not judge that he rather deserved from Christ condemnation, instead of an apostolic call? Who could so love the preacher as not to loathe the persecutor? Well, therefore, and truly does he say of himself: \"I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.\" As thou wroughtest then such evil, how camest thou to earn such good? Let all men hear his answer: \"But by the grace of God, I am what I am.\" Is there, then, no other way in which grace is commended, than because it is conferred on an unworthy recipient? \"And His grace,\" he adds, \"which was bestowed on me was not in vain.\"[fn-30-P3029_1173470:117-nf] He says this as a lesson to others also, to show the freedom of the will, when he says: \"We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.\"[fn-30-P3030_1173684:118-nf] Whence however does he derive his proof, that \"His grace bestowed on himself was not in vain,\" except from the fact which he goes on to mention: \"But I laboured more abundantly than they all?\"[fn-30-P3031_1173898:119-nf] So it seems he did not labour in order to receive grace, but he received grace in order that he might labour. And thus, when unworthy, he gratuitously received grace, whereby he might become worthy to receive the due reward. Not that he ventured to claim even his labour for himself; for, after saying: \"I laboured more abundantly than they all,\" he at once subjoined: \"Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\"[fn-30-P3032_1174342:120-nf] O mighty teacher, confessor, and preacher of grace!

In the first book, the unity and equality of that highest Trinity is shown from Holy Scripture. In the second, and third, and fourth, the same: but a careful handling of the question respecting the sending of the Son and of the Holy Spirit has resulted in three books; and we have demonstrated, that He who is sent is not therefore less than He who sends because the one sent, the other was sent; since the Trinity, which is in all things equal, being also equally in its own nature unchangeable, and invisible, and everywhere present, works indivisibly. In the fifth,-with a view to those who think that the substance of the Father and of the Son is therefore not the same, because they suppose everything that is predicated of God to be predicated according to substance, and therefore contend that to beget and to be begotten, or to be begotten and unbegotten, as being diverse, are diverse substances,-it is demonstrated that not everything that is predicated of God is predicated according to substance, as He is called good and great according to substance, or anything else that is predicated of Him in respect to Himself, but that some things also are predicated relatively, i.e. not in respect to Himself, but in respect to something which is not Himself; as He is called the Father in respect to the Son, or the Lord in respect to the creature that serves Him; and that here, if anything thus relatively predicated, i.e. predicated in respect to something that is not Himself, is predicated also as in time, as, e.g., \"Lord, Thou hast become our refuge,\"[fn-19-P1919_954967:10-nf] then nothing happens to Him so as to work a change in Him, but He Himself continues altogether unchangeable in His own nature or essence. In the sixth, the question how Christ is called by the mouth of the apostle \"the power of God and the wisdom of God,\"[fn-19-P1920_955239:11-nf] is so far argued that the more careful handling of that question is deferred, viz. whether He from whom Christ is begotten is not wisdom Himself, but only the father of His own wisdom, or whether wisdom begat wisdom. But be it which it may, the equality of the Trinity became apparent in this book also, and that God was not triple, but a Trinity; and that the Father and the Son are not, as it were, a double as opposed to the single Holy Spirit: for therein three are not anything more than one. We considered, too, how to understand the words of Bishop Hilary, \"Eternity in the Father, form in the Image, use in the Gift.\" In the seventh, the question is explained which had been deferred: in what way that God who begat the Son is not only Father of His own power and wisdom, but is Himself also power and wisdom; so, too, the Holy Spirit; and yet that they are not three powers or three wisdoms, but one power and one wisdom, as one God and one essence. It was next inquired, in what way they are called one essence, three persons, or by some Greeks one essence, three substances; and we found that the words were so used through the needs of speech, that there might be one term by which to answer, when it is asked what the three are, whom we truly confess to be three, viz. Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit. In the eighth, it is made plain by reason also to those who understand, that not only the Father is not greater than the Son in the substance of truth, but that both together are not anything greater than the Holy Spirit alone, nor that any two at all in the same Trinity are anything greater than one, nor all three together anything greater than each severally. Next, I have pointed out, that by means of the truth, which is beheld by the understanding, and by means of the highest good, from which is all good, and by means of the righteousness for which a righteous mind is loved even by a mind not yet righteous, we might understand, so far as it is possible to understand, that not only incorporeal but also unchangeable nature which is God; and by means, too, of love, which in the Holy Scriptures is called God,[fn-19-P1921_957395:12-nf] by which, first of all, those who have understanding begin also, however feebly, to discern the Trinity, to wit, one that loves, and that which is loved, and love. In the ninth, the argument advances as far as to the image of God, viz. man in respect to his mind; and in this we found a kind of trinity, i.e. the mind, and the knowledge whereby the mind knows itself, and the love whereby it loves both itself and its knowledge of itself; and these three are shown to be mutually equal, and of one essence. In the tenth, the same subject is more carefully and subtly handled, and is brought to this point, that we found in the mind a still more manifest trinity of the mind, viz. in memory, and understanding, and will. But since it turned out also, that the mind could never be in such a case as not to remember, understand, and love itself, although it did not always think of itself; but that when it did think of itself, it did not in the same act of thought distinguish itself from things corporeal; the argument respecting the Trinity, of which this is an image, was deferred, in order to find a trinity also in the things themselves that are seen with the body, and to exercise the reader's attention more distinctly in that. Accordingly, in the eleventh, we chose the sense of sight, wherein that which should have been there found to hold good might be recognized also in the other four bodily senses. although not expressly mentioned; and so a trinity of the outer man first showed itself in those things which are discerned from without, to wit, from the bodily object which is seen, and from the form which is thence impressed upon the eye of the beholder, and from the purpose of the will combining the two. But these three things, as was patent, were not mutually equal and of one substance. Next, we found yet another trinity in the mind itself, introduced into it, as it were, by the things perceived from without; wherein the same three things, as it appeared, were of one substance: the image of the bodily object which is in the memory, and the form thence impressed when the mind's eye of the thinker is turned to it, and the purpose of the will combining the two. But we found this trinity to pertain to the outer man, on this account, that it was introduced into the mind from bodily objects which are perceived from without. In the twelfth, we thought good to distinguish wisdom from knowledge, and to seek first, as being the lower of the two, a kind of appropriate and special trinity in that which is specially called knowledge; but that although we have got now in this to something pertaining to the inner man, yet it is not yet to be either called or thought an image of God. And this is discussed in the thirteenth book by the commendation of Christian faith. In the fourteenth we discuss the true wisdom of man, viz. that which is granted him by God's gift in the partaking of that very God Himself, which is distinct from knowledge; and the discussion reached this point, that a trinity is discovered in the image of God, which is man in respect to his mind, which mind is \"renewed in the knowledge\" of God,\"after the image of Him that created\" man;[fn-19-P1922_960598:13-nf] \"after His own image;\"[fn-19-P1923_960640:14-nf] and so obtains wisdom,wherein is the contemplation of things eternal.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"9. When, then, we say, Eternal, wise, blessed, are these three the Trinity that is called God? We reduce, indeed, those twelve to this small number of three; but perhaps we can go further, and reduce these three also to one of them. For if wisdom and might, or life and wisdom, can be one and the same thing in the nature of God, why cannot eternity and wisdom, or blessedness and wisdom, be one and the same thing in the nature of God? And hence, as it made no difference whether we spoke of these twelve or of those three when we reduced the many to the small number; so does it make no difference whether we speak of those three, or of that one, to the singularity of which we have shown that the other two of the three may be reduced. What fashion, then, of argument, what possible force and might of understanding, what liveliness of reason, what sharp-sightedness of thought, will set forth how (to pass over now the others) this one thing, that God is called wisdom, is a trinity? For God does not receive wisdom from any one as we receive it from Him, but He is Himself His own wisdom; because His wisdom is not one thing, and His essence another, seeing that to Him to be wise is to be. Christ, indeed, is called in the Holy Scriptures, \"the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-19-P1939_969552:20-nf] But we have discussed in the seventh book how this is to be understood, so that the Son may not seem to. make the Father wise; and our explanation came to this, that the Son is wisdom of wisdom, in the same way as He is light of light, God of God. Nor could we find the Holy Spirit to be in any other way than that He. Himself also is wisdom, and altogether one wisdom, as one God, one essence. How, then, do we understand this wisdom, which is God, to be a trinity? I do not say, How do we believe this? For among the faithful this ought to admit no question.

As, then, we call the only Word of God specially by the name of Wisdom, although universally both the Holy Spirit and the Father Himself is wisdom; so the Holy Spirit is specially called by the name of Love, although universally both the Father and the Son are love.

He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.\" Here, manifestly, he has called that love God, which he said was of God; therefore God of God is love. But because both the Son is born of God the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father, it is rightly asked which of them we ought here to think is the rather called the love that is God. For the Father only is so God as not to be of God; and hence the love that is so God as to be of God, is either the Son or the Holy Spirit. But when, in what follows, the apostle had mentioned the love of God, not that by which we love Him, but that by which He \"loved us, and sent His Son to be a propitiator for our sins,\"[fn-20-P2041_1036223:74-nf] and thereupon had exhorted us also to love one another, and that so God would abide in us,-because, namely, he had called God Love; immediately, in his wish to speak yet more expressly on the subject, \"Hereby,\" he says, \"know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.\" Therefore the Holy Spirit, of whom He hath given us, makes us to abide in God, and Him in us; and this it is that love does. Therefore He is the God that is love. Lastly, a little after, when he had repeated the same thing, and had said \"God is love,\" he immediately subjoined, \"And he who abideth in love, abideth in God, and God abideth in him;\" whence he had said above, \"Hereby we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.\" He therefore is signified, where we read that God is love. Therefore God the Holy Spirit, who proceedeth from the Father, when He has been given to man, inflames him to the love of God and of his neighbor, and is Himself love. For man has not whence to love God, unless from God; and therefore he says a little after, \"Let us love Him, because He first loved us.\"[fn-20-P2042_1037378:75-nf] The Apostle Paul, too, says, \"The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.\"[fn-20-P2043_1037519:76-nf] ","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_24_the_prescription_against_heretics_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Moreover, when he blames dissensions and schisms, which undoubtedly are evils, he immediately adds heresies likewise.

Surely he does not intend to charge against us also that we preach the doctrine of dissimilarity in essence! Why, it is rather to those who turn aside to this opinion that the reproach belongs of going about to make the Cross a shameful thing. For if by both parties alike the dispensation of the Passion is held as part of the faith, while we hold it necessary to honour, even as the Father is honoured, the God Who was manifested by the Cross, and they find the Passion a hindrance to glorifying the Only-begotten God equally with the Father that begat Him, then our sophist's charges recoil upon himself, and in the words with which he imagines himself to be accusing us, he is publishing his own doctrinal impiety. For it is clear that the reason why he sets the Father above the Son, and exalts Him with supreme honour, is this,-that in Him is not seen the shame of the Cross: and the reason why he asseverates that the nature of the Son varies in the sense of inferiority is this,-that the reproach of the Cross is referred to Him alone, and does not touch the Father. And let no one think that in saying this I am only following the general drift of his composition, for in going through all the blasphemy of his speech, which is there laboriously brought together, I found, in a passage later than that before us, this very blasphemy clearly expressed in undisguised language; and I propose to set forth, in the orderly course of my own argument, what they have written, which runs thus:-\"If,\" he says, \"he can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the unapproachable Light, was incarnate, or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, then let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.\" Who then is it who is ashamed of the Cross? he who, even after the Passion, worships the Son equally with the Father, or he who even before the Passion insults Him, not only by ranking Him with the creation, but by maintaining that He is of passible nature, on the ground that He could not have come to experience His sufferings had He not had a nature capable of such sufferings? We on our part assert that even the body in which He underwent His Passion, by being mingled with the Divine Nature, was made by that commixture to be that which the assuming[fn-16-P1610_927899:25-nf] Nature is. So far are we from entertaining any low idea concerning the Only-begotten God, that if anything belonging to our lowly nature was assumed in His dispensation of love for man, we believe that even this was transformed to what is Divine and incorruptible[fn-16-P1611_928232:26-nf] ; but Eunomius makes the suffering of the Cross to be a sign of divergence in essence, in the sense of inferiority, considering, I know not how, the surpassing act of power, by which He was able to perform this, to be an evidence of weakness; failing to perceive the fact that, while nothing which moves according to its own nature is looked upon as surprisingly wonderful, all things that overpass the limitations of their own nature become especially the objects of admiration, and to them every ear is turned, every mind is attentive, in wonder at the marvel. And hence it is that all who preach the word point out the wonderful character of the mystery in this respect,-that \"God was manifested in the flesh[fn-16-P1612_929216:27-nf] ,\" that \"the Word was made flesh[fn-16-P1613_929324:28-nf] ,\" that \"the Light shined in darkness[fn-16-P1614_929382:29-nf] ,\" \"the Life tasted death,\" and all such declarations which the heralds of the faith are wont to make, whereby is increased the marvellous character of Him Who manifested the superabundance of His power by means external to his own nature. But though they think fit to make this a subject for their insolence, though they make the dispensation of the Cross a reason for partitioning off the Son from equality of glory with the Father, we believe, as those \"who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word[fn-16-P1615_929942:30-nf] \" delivered to us by the Holy Scriptures, that the God who was in the beginning, \"afterwards\", as Baruch says, \"was seen upon the earth, and conversed with men[fn-16-P1616_930121:31-nf] ,\" and, becoming a ransom for our death, loosed by His own resurrection the bonds of death, and by Himself made the resurrection a way for all flesh[fn-16-P1617_930289:32-nf] , and being on the same throne and in the same glory with His own Father, will in the day of judgment give sentence upon those who are judged, according to the desert of the lives they have led. These are the things which we believe concerning Him Who was crucified, and for this cause we cease not to extol Him exceedingly, according to the measure of our powers, that He Who by reason of His unspeakable and unapproachable greatness is not comprehensible by any, save by Himself and the Father and the Holy Spirit, He, I say, was able even to descend to community with our weakness. But they adduce this proof of the Son's alienation in nature from the Father, that the Lord was manifested by the flesh and by the Cross, arguing on the ground that the Father's nature remained pure in impassibility, and could not in any way admit of a community which tended to passion, while the Son, by reason of the divergence of His nature by way of humiliation, was not incapable of being brought to experience the flesh and death, seeing that the change of condition was not great, but one which took place in a certain sense from one like state to another state kindred and homogeneous, because the nature of man is created, and the nature of the Only-begotten is created also. Who then is fairly charged with being ashamed of the Cross? he who speaks basely of it[fn-16-P1618_931677:33-nf] , or he who contends for its more exalted aspect? I know not whether our accuser, who thus abases the God Who was made known upon the Cross, has heard the lofty speech of Paul, in what terms and at what length he discourses with his exalted lips concerning that Cross. For he, who was able to make himself known by miracles so many and so great, says, \"God forbid that I should glory in anything else, than, in the Cross of Christ[fn-16-P1619_932244:34-nf] .\" And to the Corinthians he says that the word of the Cross is \"the power of God to them that are in a state of salvation[fn-16-P1620_932400:35-nf] .\" To the Ephesians, moreover, he describes by the figure of the Cross the power that controls and holds together the universe, when he expresses a desire that they may be exalted to know the exceeding glory of ibis power, calling it height, and depth, and breadth, and length[fn-16-P1621_932700:36-nf] , speaking of the several projections we behold in the figure of the Cross by their proper names, so that he calls the upper part \"height,\" and that which is below, on the opposite side of the junction, \"depth,\" while by the name \"length and breadth\" he indicates the cross-beam projecting to either side, that hereby might be manifested this great mystery, that both things in heaven, and things under the earth, and all the furthest bounds of the things that are, are ruled and sustained by Him Who gave an example of this unspeakable and mighty power in the figure of the Cross.

And let no one think that the divine Apostle is divided against himself in contradiction, and affords by his own utterances matter for their contentions on either side to those who dispute upon the doctrines. For careful examination would find that his argument is accurately directed to one aim; and he is not halting in his opinions: for while he everywhere proclaims the combination of the Human with the Divine, he none the less discerns in each its proper nature, in the sense that while the human weakness is changed for the better by its communion with the imperishable, the Divine power, on the other hand, is not abased by its contact with the lowly form of nature. When therefore he says, \"He spared not His own Son,\" he contrasts the true Son with the other sons, begotten, or exalted, or adopted[fn-16-P1685_968630:19-nf] (those, I mean, who were brought into being at His command), marking the specialty of nature by the addition of \"own.\" And, to the end that no one should connect the suffering of the Cross with the imperishable nature, he gives in other words a fairly distinct correction of such an error, when he calls Him \"mediator between God and men[fn-16-P1686_969321:20-nf] \" and \"man[fn-16-P1687_969351:21-nf] ,\" and \"God[fn-16-P1688_969382:22-nf] ,\" that, from the fact that both are predicated of the one Being, the fit conception might be entertained concerning each Nature-concerning the Divine Nature, impassibility, concerning the Human Nature, the dispensation of the Passion. As his thought, then, divides that which in love to man was made one, but is distinguished in idea, he uses, when he is proclaiming that nature which transcends and surpasses all intelligence, the more exalted order of names, calling Him \"God over all[fn-16-P1689_969953:23-nf] ,\" \"the great God[fn-16-P1690_969987:24-nf] ,\" \"the power\" of God, and \"the wisdom\". of God[fn-16-P1691_970053:25-nf] , and the like; but when he is alluding to all that experience of suffering which, by reason of our weakness, was necessarily assumed with our nature, he gives to the union of the Natures[fn-16-P1692_970260:26-nf] that name which is derived from ours, and calls Him Man, not by this word placing Him Whom he is setting forth to us on a common level with the rest of nature, but so that orthodoxy is protected as regards each Nature, in the sense that the Human Nature is glorified by His assumption of it, and the Divine is not polluted by Its condescension, but makes the Human element subject to sufferings, while working, through Its Divine power, the resurrection of that which suffered. And thus the experience of death is not[fn-16-P1693_970800:27-nf] referred to Him Who had communion in our passible nature by reason of the union with Him of the Man, while at the same time the exalted and Divine names descend to the Man, so that He Who was manifested upon the Cross is called even \"the Lord of glory[fn-16-P1694_971491:28-nf] ,\" since the majesty implied in these names is transmitted from the Divine to the Human by the commixture of Its Nature with that Nature which is lowly. For this cause he describes Him in varied and different language, at one time as Him Who came down from heaven, at another time as Him Who was born of woman, as God from eternity, and Man in the last days; thus too theOnly-begotten God is held to be impassible, and Christ to be capable of suffering; nor does his discourse speak falsely in these opposing statements, as it adapts in its conceptions to each Nature the terms that belong to it. If then these are the doctrines which we have learnt from inspired teaching, how do we refer the cause of our salvation to an ordinary man? and if we declare the word \"made\" employed by the blessed Peter to have regard not to the pre-temporal existence, but to the new dispensation of the Incarnation, what has this to do with the charge against us? For this great Apostle says that that which was seen in the form of the servant has been made, by being assumed, to be that which He Who assumed it was in His own Nature. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Hebrews we may learn the same truth from Paul, when he says that Jesus was made an Apostle and High Priest by God, \"being faithful to him that made Him so[fn-16-P1695_972815:29-nf] .\" For in that passage too, in giving the name of High Priest to Him Who made with His own Blood the priestly propitiation for our sins, he does not by the word \"made\" declare the first existence of the Only-begotten, but says \"made\" with the intention of representing that grace which is commonly spoken of in connection with the appointment of priests. For Jesus, the great High Priest (as Zechariah says[fn-16-P1696_973257:30-nf] ), Who offered up his own lamb, that is, His own Body, for the sin of the world; Who, by reason of the children that arc partakers of flesh and blood, Himself also in like manner took part with them in blood[fn-16-P1697_973488:31-nf] (not in that He was in the beginning, being the Word and God, and being in the form of God, and equal with God, but in that He emptied Himself in the form of the servant, and offered an oblation and sacrifice for us), He, I say, became a High Priest many generations later, after the order of Melchisedech[fn-16-P1698_973816:32-nf] . Surely a reader who has more than a casual acquaintance with the discourse to the Hebrews knows the mystery of this matter. As, then, in that passage He is said to have been made Priest and Apostle, so here He is said to have been made Lord and Christ,-the latter for the dispensation on our behalf, the former by the change and transformation of the Human to the Divine (for by \"making\" the Apostle means \"making anew\"). Thus is manifest the knavery of our adversaries, who insolently wrest the words referring to the dispensation to apply them to the pretemporal existence. For we learn from the Apostle not to know Christ in the same manner now as before, as Paul thus speaks, \"Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now know we Him no more[fn-16-P1699_974600:33-nf] ,\" in the sense that the one knowledge manifests to us His temporary dispensation, the other His eternal existence. Thus our discourse has made no inconsiderable answer to his charges:-that we neither hold two Christs nor two Lords, that we are not ashamed of the Cross, that we do not glorify a mere man as having suffered for the world, that we assuredly do not think that the word \"made\" refers to the formation of the essence. But, such being our view, our argument has no small support from our accuser himself, where in the midst of his discourse he employs his tongue in a flourishing onslaught upon us, and produces this sentence among others: \"This, then, is the conflict that Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither to have `applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles,' nor to be able to preserve the sequence of his own arguments; for according to them he must, if he is conscious of their irreconcilable character, admit that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God became Lord,\" or he fits together \"statements that are mutually conflicting.\" Why, this is actually our statement which Eunomius repeats, who says that \"the Word that was in the beginning and was God became Lord.\" For, being what He was, God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and Grace, and Truth, and Lord, and Christ, and every name exalted and Divine, He did become, in the Man assumed by Him, Who was none of these, all else which the Word was and among the rest did become Lord and Christ, according to the teaching of Peter, and according to the confession of Eunomius;-not in the sense that the Godhead acquired anything by way of advancement, but (all exalted majesty being contemplated in the Divine Nature) He thus becomes Lord and Christ, not by arriving at any addition of grace in respect of His Godhead (for the Nature of the Godhead is acknowledged to be lacking in no good), but by bringing the Human Nature to theft participation in the Godhead which is signified by the terms \"Christ\" and \"Lord.\"","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"12.

No one shall take it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command have I received from the Father[fn-17-P1767_1160735:22-nf] : and again, when asked to shew a sign concerning Himself, that they night believe in Him, He says of the Temple of His body, Detroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up[fn-17-P1768_1160943:23-nf] . By the power to take His soul again and to raise the Temple up, He declares Himself God, and the Resurrection His own work: yet He refers all to the authority of His Father's command. This is not contrary to the meaning of the Apostle, when He proclaims Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God[fn-17-P1769_1161263:24-nf] , thus referring all the magnificence of His work to the glory of the Father: for whatever Christ does, the power and the wisdom of God does: and whatever the power and the wisdom of God does, without doubt God Himself does, Whose power and wisdom Christ is.

For it rather commands than assists; it discovers disease, but does not heal it; nay, the malady that is not healed is rather aggravated by it, so that the cure of grace is more earnestly and anxiously sought for, inasmuch as \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\"[fn-32-P3238_1261235:11-nf] \"For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.\"[fn-32-P3239_1261370:12-nf] To what extent, however, the law gives assistance, the apostle informs us when he says immediately afterwards: \"The Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-32-P3240_1261625:13-nf] Wherefore, says the apostle, \"the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-32-P3241_1261721:14-nf] Now this very thing is serviceable to proud men, to be more firmly and manifestly \"concluded under sin,\" so that none may pre-sumptuously endeavour to accomplish their justification by means of free will as if by their own resources; but rather \"that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

Indeed, the gospel parable about the wicked husbandmen shows that our Lord Jesus Himself said something like it: \"This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.\"[fn-32-P3230_1772544:138-nf] In like manner also that passage in this same book, on which we have already touched[fn-32-P3231_1772652:139-nf] when we were speaking of the barren woman who hath born seven, must soon after it was tittered have come to be understood of only Christ and the Church by those who knew that Christ was the Wisdom of God. \"Wisdom hath builded her an house, and hath set up seven pillars; she hath sacrificed her victims, she hath mingled her wine in the bowl; she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent her servants summoning to the bowl with excellent proclamation, saying, Who is simple, let him turn aside to me. And to the void of sense she hath said, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled for you.\"[fn-32-P3232_1773287:140-nf] Here certainly we perceive that the Wisdom of God, that is, the Word co-eternal with the Father, hath builded Him an house, even a human body in the virgin womb, and hath subjoined the Church to it as members to a head, hath slain the martyrs as victims, hath furnished a table with wine and bread, where appears also the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, and hath called the simple and the void of sense, because, as saith the apostle, \"He hath chosen the weak things of this world that He might confound the things which are mighty.\"[fn-32-P3233_1773888:141-nf] Yet to these weak ones she saith what follows, \"Forsake simplicity, that ye may live; and seek prudence, that ye may have life.\"[fn-32-P3234_1774039:142-nf] But to be made partakers of this table is itself to begin to have life.

For that sacrifice has succeeded all the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which were slain as a shadow of that which was to come; wherefore also we recognize the voice in the 40th Psalm as that of the same Mediator speaking through prophesy,\" Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire; but a body hast Thou perfected for me.\"[fn-32-P3236_1774872:144-nf] Because, instead of all these sacrifices and oblations, His body is offered, and is served up to the partakers of it.

Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in season, in fortitude, and not in confusion!\"[fn-32-P3239_1775878:147-nf] He has called the devil a youth, because of the folly and pride, and rashness and unruliness, and other vices which are wont to abound at that age; but Christ is the Son of nobles, that is, of the holy patriarchs, of those belonging to the free city, of whom He was begotten in the flesh. The princes of that and other cities are eaters in the morning, that is, before the suitable hour, because they do not expect the seasonable felicity, which is the true, in tile world to come, desiring to be speedily made happy with the renown of this world; but the princes of the city of Christ patiently wait for the time of a blessedness that is not fallacious. This is expressed by the words, \"in fortitude, and not in confusion,\" because hope does not deceive them; of which the apostle says, \"But hope maketh not ashamed.\"[fn-32-P3240_1776724:148-nf] A psalm also saith, \"For they that hope in Thee shall not be put to shame.\"[fn-32-P3241_1776818:149-nf] But now the Song of Songs is a certain spiritual pleasure of holy minds, in the marriage of that King and Queen-city, that is, Christ and the Church.

God forbid.\"[fn-26-P2677_1250740:194-nf] For it seems unjust that, in the absence of any merit or demerit, from good or evil works, God should love the one and hate the other. Now, if the apostle had wished us to understand that there were future good works of the one, and evil works of the other, which of course God foreknew, he would never have said, \"not of works,\" but, \"of future works,\" and in that way would have solved the difficulty, or rather there would then have been no difficulty to solve. As it is, however, after answering, \"God forbid;\" that is, God forbid that there should be unrighteousness with God; he goes on to prove that there is no unrighteousness in God's doing this, and says: \"For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\"[fn-26-P2678_1251555:195-nf] Now, who but a fool would think that God was unrighteous, either in inflicting penal justice on those who had earned it, or in extending mercy to the unworthy?

And as this judgment was due to both, the former learnt from the case of the latter that the fact of the same punishment not falling upon himself gave him no room to glory in any merit of his own, but only in the riches of the divine grace; because \"it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.\" And indeeed the whole face, and, if I may use the expression, every lineament of the countenance of Scripture conveys by a very profound analogy this wholesome warning to every one who looks carefully into it, that he who glories should glory in the Lord.[fn-26-P2680_1252836:197-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":101,"source_paragraph":"336","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Now after commending the mercy of God, saying, \"So it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,\" that he might commend His justice also (for the man who does not obtain mercy finds, not iniquity, but justice, there being no iniquity with God), he immediately adds: \"For the scripture saith unto Pharoah, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.\"[fn-26-P2684_1253444:198-nf] And then he draws a conclusion that applies to both, that is, both to His mercy and His justice: \"Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.\"[fn-26-P2685_1253659:199-nf] \"He hath mercy\" of His great goodness, \"He hardeneth\" without any injustice; so that neither can he that is pardoned glory in any merit of his own, nor he that is condemned complain of anything but his own demerit.

Let him declare the Divine names by which He Who, according to Eunomius, \"once was not,\" is called. He will say, I suppose, \"light,\" and \"blessedness,\" \"life\" and \"incorruptibility,\" and \"righteousness\" and \"sanctification,\" and \"power,\" and \"truth,\" and the like. He who says, then, that \"He was not before His generation,\" absolutely proclaims this,-that when He \"was not\" there was no truth, no life, no light, no power, no incorruptibility, no other of those pre-eminent qualities which are conceived of Him: and, what is still more marvellous and still more difficult for impiety to face, there was no \"brightness,\" no \"express image.\" For in saying that there was no brightness, there is surely maintained also the non-existence of the radiating power, as one may see in the illustration afforded by the lamp. For he who speaks, of the ray of the lamp indicates also that the lamp shines, and he who says that the ray \"is not,\" signifies also the extinction of that which gives light: so that when the Son is said not to be thereby is also maintained as a necessary consequence the non-existence of the Father. For if the one is related to the other by way of conjunction, according to the Apostolic testimony-the \"brightness\" to the \"glory,\" the \"express image\" to the \"Person,\" the \"Wisdom\" to God-he who says that one of the things so conjoined \"is not,\" surely by his abolition of the one abolishes also that which remains; so that if the \"brightness\" \"was not,\" it is acknowledged that neither did the illuminating nature exist, and if the \"express image\" had no existence, neither did the Person imaged exist, and if the wisdom and power of God \"was not,\" it is surely acknowledged that He also was not, Who is not conceived by Himself without wisdom and power. If, then, the Only-begotten God, as Eunomius says, \"was not before His generation,\" and Christ is \"the power of God and the wisdom of God[fn-18-P1865_1094050:35-nf] ,\" and the \"express image\"[fn-18-P1866_1094096:36-nf] and the \"brightness[fn-18-P1867_1094132:37-nf] ,\" neither surely did the Father exist, Whose power and wisdom and express image and brightness the Son is: for it is not possible to conceive by reason either a Person without express image, or glory without radiance, or God without wisdom, or a Maker without hands, or a Beginning without the Word[fn-18-P1868_1094448:38-nf] , or a Father without a Son; but all such things, alike by those who confess and by those who deny, are manifestly declared to be in mutual union, and by the abolition of one the other also disappears with it. Since then they maintain that the Son (that is, the \"brightness of the glory,\") \"was not\" before He was begotten, and since logical consequence involves also, together with the non-existence of the brightness, the abolition of the glory, and the Father is the glory whence came the brightness of the Only-begotten Light, let these men who are wise over-much consider that they are manifestly supporters of the Epicurean doctrines, preaching atheism under the guise of Christianity. Now since the logical consequence is shown to be one of two absurdities, either that we should say that God does nor exist at all, or that we should say that His being was not unoriginate, let them choose which they like of the two courses before them,-either to be called atheist, or to cease saying that the essence of the Father is un-originate. They would avoid, I suppose. being reckoned atheists. It remains, therefore, that they maintain that God is not eternal. And if the course of what has been proved forces them to this, what becomes of their varied and irreversible conversions of names?

For they assured us that they had not gone over to impiety; but lest certain most impious persons should be elected and ruin the Churches they elected rather to acquiesce in the violence and to bear the burden, than to lose the people.

For there was reason in the view, that if they remained in the wilderness they might cease from their impiety: but if they went into Egypt they would become ruined and increase the impiety in their midst.

His greatness, as I think, is shown in this, that from the beginning He made Himself known: He never hid Himself, but always shone out brightly, even before the time of Romulus, to say nothing of that of Tiberius; with the exception indeed that the heretics, and they alone, know Him not, although they take such pains about Him. They on this account suppose that another god must be assumed to exist, because they are more able to censure than deny Him whose existence is so evident, deriving all their thoughts about God from the deductions of sense; just as if some blind man, or a man of imperfect vision,[fn-42-P4287_1395122:9-nf] chose to assume some other sun of milder and healthier ray, because he sees not that which is the object of sight.[fn-42-P4288_1395262:10-nf] There is, O man, but one sun which rules[fn-42-P4289_1395332:11-nf] this world and even when you think otherwise of him, he is best and useful; and although to you he may seem too fierce and baneful, or else, it may be, too sordid and corrupt, he yet is true to the laws of his own existence. Unable as you are to see through those laws, you would be equally impotent to bear the rays of any other sun, were there one, however great and good. Now, you whose sight is defective[fn-42-P4290_1395756:12-nf] in respect of the inferior god, what is your view of the sublimer One? Really you are too lenient[fn-42-P4291_1395869:13-nf] to your weakness; and set not yourself to the proof[fn-42-P4292_1395946:14-nf] of things, holding God to be certainly, undoubtedly, and therefore sufficiently known, the very moment you have discovered Him to exist, though you know Him not except on the side where He has willed His proofs to lie. But you do not even deny God intelligently,[fn-42-P4293_1396239:15-nf] you treat of Him ignorantly;[fn-42-P4294_1396284:16-nf] nay, you accuse Him with a semblance of intelligence,[fn-42-P4295_1396356:17-nf] whom if you did but know Him, you would never accuse, nay, never treat of.[fn-42-P4296_1396450:18-nf] You give Him His name indeed, but you deny the essential truth of that name, that is, the greatness which is called God; not acknowledging it to be such as, were it possible for it to have been known to man in every respect,[fn-42-P4297_1396693:19-nf] would not be greatness. Isaiah even so early, with the clearness of an apostle, foreseeing the thoughts of heretical hearts, asked, \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? For who hath been His counsellor? With whom took He counsel? ... or who taught Him knowledge, and showed to Him the way of understanding? \"[fn-42-P4298_1397018:20-nf] With whom the apostle agreeing exclaims, \"Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"[fn-42-P4299_1397241:21-nf] \"His judgments unsearchable,\" as being those of God the Judge; and \"His ways past finding out,\" as comprising an understanding and knowledge which no man has ever shown to Him, except it may be those critics of the Divine Being, who say, God ought not to have been this,[fn-43-P4300_1397530:22-nf] and He ought rather to have been that; as if any one knew what is in God, except the Spirit of God.[fn-43-P4301_1397717:23-nf] Moreover, having the spirit of the world, and \"in the wisdom of God by wisdom knowing not God,\"[fn-43-P4302_1397833:24-nf] they seem to themselves to be wiser[fn-43-P4303_1397886:25-nf] than God; because, as the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God, so also the wisdom of God is folly in the world's esteem. We, however, know that \"the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\"[fn-43-P4304_1398147:26-nf] Accordingly, God is then especially great, when He is small[fn-43-P4305_1398226:27-nf] to man; then especially good, when not good in man's judgment; then especially unique, when He seems to man to be two or more.

Or who will hesitate to declare the great sin of Adam to have been heresy, when he committed it by the choice[fn-43-P4310_1399386:32-nf] of his own will rather than of God's? Except that Adam never said to his fig-tree, Why hast thou made me thus? He confessed that he was led astray; and he did not conceal the seducer. He was a very rude heretic.

And why should I bring forward the declarations of Paul in evidence of the lordship of the Lord?

On one side the Lord Himself, and he who has Christ speaking in him[fn-19-P1991_1196212:36-nf] , enjoin us not to think of Him as a slave, but to honour Him even as the Father is honoured, and on the other side Eunomius brings his suit against the Lord, claiming Him as a slave, when he says that He on Whose shoulders rests the government of the universe is under dominion. Can our choice what to do be doubtful, or is the decision which is the more advantageous course unimportant? Shall I slight the advice of Paul, Eunomius? shall I deem the voice of the Truth less trustworthy than thy deceit?

How much less, therefore, could the Word of God, who is neither corporeal nor visible, sustain defilement from the female body, wherein He assumed human flesh together with soul and spirit, through the incoming of which the majesty of the Word dwells in a less immediate conjunction with the frailty of a human body![fn-32-P3215_1486895:51-nf] Hence it is manifest that the Word of God could in no way have been defiled by a human body, by which even the human soul is not defiled. For not when it rules the body and quickens it, but only when it lusts after the mortal good things thereof, is the soul defiled by the body. But if these persons were to desire to avoid the defilements of the soul, they would dread rather these falsehoods and profanities.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_31_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_philippians","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Being mindful of your love and of your zeal in Christ, which ye have manifested towards us, we thought it fitting to write to you, who display such a godly and spiritual love to the brethren,[fn-28-P2853_462018:2-nf] to put you in remembrance of your Christian course,[fn-28-P2854_462142:3-nf] \"that ye all speak the same thing, being of one mind, thinking the same thing, and walking by the same rule of faith,\"[fn-28-P2855_462295:4-nf] as Paul admonished you.

For he wishes to show that the essence of the Son is subject to passion, and to decay, and in no wise differs from material nature, which is in a state of flux, that by this means he may demonstrate His difference from the Father. For he says, \"If he can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the Light unapproachable, was incarnate or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.\" If these words had been brought forward by us as following by necessary consequence from premises laid down by Eunomius, who would not have charged us with unfairness, in employing an over-subtle dialectic to reduce our adversaries' statement to such an absurdity? But as things stand, the fact that they themselves make no attempt to suppress the absurdity that naturally follows from their assumption, helps to support our contention that it was not without due reflection that, with the help of truth, we censured life argument of heresy. For behold, how undisguised and outspoken is their striving against the Only-begotten God! Nay, by His enemies His work of mercy is reckoned a means of disparaging and maligning the Nature of the Son of God, as though not of deliberate purpose, but by a compulsion of His Nature he had slipped down to life in the flesh, and to the suffering of the Cross! And as it is the nature of a stone to fall downward, and of fire to rise upward, and as these material objects do not exchange their natures one with another, so that the stone should have an upward tendency, and fire be depressed by its weight and sink downwards, even so they make out that passion was part of the very Nature of the Son, and that for this cause He came to that which was akin and familiar to Him, but that the Nature of the Father, being free from such passions, remained unapproachable by the contact of evil. For he says, that the God Who is over all, Who is Light unapproachable, neither was incarnate nor could be incarnate. The first of the two statements was quite enough, that the Father did not become incarnate. But now by his addition a double absurdity arises; for he either charges the Son with evil, or the Father with powerlessness. For if to partake of our flesh is evil, then he predicates evil of the Only-begotten God; but if the lovingkindness to man was good, then he makes out the Father to be powerless for good, by saying that it would not have been in His power to have effectually bestowed such grace by taking flesh. And yet who in the world does not know that life-giving power proceeds to actual operation both in the Father and in the Son? \"For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them,\" He says, \"even so the Son quickeneth whom He will[fn-21-P2125_1289217:32-nf] ,\"-meaning obviously by \"dead\" us who had fallen from the true life. If then it is even so as the Father quickeneth, and not otherwise, that the Son brings to operation the same grace, how comes it that the adversary of God moves his profane tongue against both, insulting the Father by attributing to Him powerlessness for good, and the Son by attributing to Him association with evil. But \"Light,\" he says, \"is not equal to Light,\" because the one he calls \"true,\" and the other \"unapproachable.\" Is then the true considered to be a diminution of the unapproachable? Why so? and yet their argument is that the Godhead of the Father must be conceived to be greater and more exalted than that of the Son, because the one is called in the Gospel \"true God[fn-21-P2126_1289992:33-nf] ,\" the other \"God[fn-21-P2127_1290032:34-nf] \" without the addition of \"true.\" How then does the same term, as applied to the Godhead, indicate an enhancement of the conception, and, as applied to Light, a diminution? For if they say that the Father is greater than the Son because He is true God, by the same showing the Son would be acknowledged to be greater than the Father, because the former is called \"true Light[fn-21-P2128_1290426:35-nf] ,\" and the latter not so. \"But this Light,\" says Eunomius, \"carried into effect the plan of mercy, while the other remained inoperative with respect to that gracious action.\" A new and strange mode of determining priority in dignity! They judge that which is ineffective for a benevolent purpose to be superior to that which is operative. But such a notion as this neither exists nor ever will be found amongst Christians,-a notion by which it is made out that every good that is in existent things has not its origin from the Father. But of goods that pertain to us men, the crowning blessing is held by all right-minded men to be the return to life; and it is secured by the dispensation carried out by the Lord in His human nature; not that the Father remained aloof, as heresy will have it, ineffective and inoperative during the time of this dispensation. For it is not this that He indicates Who said, \"He that sent Me is with Me[fn-21-P2129_1291381:36-nf] ,\" and \"The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works[fn-21-P2130_1291482:37-nf] .\" With what right then does heresy attribute to the Son alone the gracious intervention on our behalf, and thereby exclude the Father from having any part or lot in our gratitude for its successful issue? For naturally the requital of thanks is due to our benefactors alone, and He Who is incapable of benefiting us is outside the pale of our gratitude. See you how the course of their profane attack upon the Only-begotten Son has missed its mark, and is working round in natural consequence so as to be directed against the majesty of the Father? And this seems to me to be a necessary result of their method of proceeding. For if he that honoureth the Son honoureth the Father[fn-21-P2131_1292185:38-nf] , according to the Divine declaration, it is plain on the other side that an assault upon the Son strikes at the Father. But I say that to those who with simplicity of heart receive the preaching of the Cross and the resurrection, the same grace should be a cause of equal thankfulness to the Son and to the Father, and now that the Son has accomplished the Father's will (and this, in the language of the Apostle, is \"that all men should be saved[fn-21-P2132_1292657:39-nf] \"), they ought for this boon to honour the Father and the Son alike, inasmuch as our salvation would not have been wrought, had not the good will of the Father proceeded to actual operation for us through His own power. And we have learnt from the Scripture that the Son is the learnt of the Father[fn-21-P2133_1292975:40-nf] .","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_27_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"And why do I speak about the creation?

We often find in the symbolical passages of Scripture, that the same person appears in different characters on different occasions. So, on this occasion, Moses represents and prefigures the Jewish people as placed under the law. As, then, Moses, when he struck the rock with his rod, doubted the power of God, so the people who were under the law given by Moses, when they nailed Christ to the cross, did not believe Him to be the power of God. And as water flowed from the smitten rock for those that were athirst, so life comes to believers from the stroke of the Lord's passion. The testimony of the apostle is clear and decisive on this point, when he says, \"This rock was Christ.\"[fn-16-P1699_949647:27-nf] In the command of God, that the death of the flesh of Moses should take place on the mountain, we see the divine appointment that the carnal doubt of the divinity of Christ should die on Christ's exaltation. As the rock is Christ, so is the mountain. The rock is the fortitude of His humiliation; the mountain the height of His exaltation. For as the apostle says, \"This rock was Christ,\" so Christ Himself says, \"A city set upon an hill cannot be hid,\"[fn-17-P1700_950119:28-nf] showing that He is the hill, and believers the city built upon the glory of His name. The carnal mind lives when, like the smitten rock, the humiliation of Christ on the cross is despised. For Christ crucified is to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness. And the carnal mind dies when, like the mountain-top, Christ is seen in His exaltation. \"For to them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-17-P1701_950605:29-nf] Moses therefore ascended the mount, that in the death of the flesh he might be received by the living spirit. If Faustus had ascended, he would not have uttered carnal objections from a dead mind. It was the carnal mind that made Peter dread the smiting of the rock, when, on the occasion of the Lord's foretelling His passion, he said, \"Be it far from Thee, Lord; spare Thyself.\" And this sin too was severely rebuked, when the Lord replied, \"Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offense unto me: for thou savorest not the things which be of God, but those which be of men.\"[fn-17-P1702_951206:30-nf] And where did this carnal distrust die but in the glorification of Christ, as on a mountain height? If it was alive when Peter timidly denied Christ, it was dead when he fearlessly preached Him. It was alive in Saul, when, in his aversion to the offense of the cross, he made havoc of the Christian faith, and where but on this mountain had it died, when Paul was able to say, \"I live no longer, but Christ liveth in me?\"[fn-17-P1703_951652:31-nf] ","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"16.

And of Christ it is written: \"Who was made unto us by God, Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.\"[fn-36-P3697_1744457:99-nf] In every sin therefore without doubt there is an act of lust against Christ. But when He, Who \"healeth all our sicknesses,\"[fn-36-P3698_1744601:100-nf] a shall have led His Church unto the promised healing of sickness, then in none of its members shall there be any, even the very least spot or wrinkle. Then in no way shall the flesh lust against the spirit, and therefore there shall be no cause why the spirit also lust against the flesh. Then all this conflict shall come to an end, then there shall be the highest concord of both substances; then to such a degree shall no one there be carnal, that even the flesh itself shall be spiritual. What therefore each one living after Christ doth with his flesh, whereas he both lusts against its evil lust, which he restrains, hereafter to be healed, which he holds, not yet healed; and yet nourisheth and cherisheth its good nature, since \"no one ever hated his own flesh,\"[fn-36-P3699_1745393:101-nf] this also Christ doth with the Church, so far as it is lawful to compare lesser with greater matters. For He both represses it with rebukes, that it burst not being puffed up with impunity; and raises it up with consolations, that it sink not being weighed down with infirmity. Hence is that of the Apostle, \"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are rebuked of the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.\"[fn-37-P3700_1745874:102-nf] And that in the Psalm, \"After the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have gladdened my soul.\"[fn-37-P3701_1746012:103-nf] We are therefore then to hope for perfect soundness of our flesh without any opposition, when there shall be sure security of the Church of Christ without any fear.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"32.

For to this day they salute each other[fn-73-P7355_2121052:198-nf] with the greeting of \"peace,\" and formerly in their Scriptures they did the same. But I understand him by his practice[fn-73-P7356_2121189:199-nf] plainly enough to have corroborated the declaration of the Creator: \"How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good, who preach the gospel of peace!\"[fn-73-P7357_2121375:200-nf] For the herald of good, that is, of God's \"grace\" was well aware that along with it \"peace\" also was to be proclaimed.[fn-73-P7358_2121514:201-nf] Now, when he announces these blessings as \"from God the Father and the Lord Jesus,\"[fn-73-P7359_2121630:202-nf] he uses titles that are common to both, and which are also adapted to the mystery of our faith;[fn-73-P7360_2121746:203-nf] and I suppose it to be impossible accurately to determine what God is declared to be the Father and the Lord Jesus, unless (we consider) which of their accruing attributes are more suited to them severally.[fn-73-P7361_2122000:204-nf] First, then, I assert that none other than the Creator and Sustainer of both man and the universe can be acknowledged as Father and Lord; next, that to the Father also the title of Lord accrues by reason of His power, and that the Son too receives the same through the Father; then that \"grace and peace\" are not only His who had them published, but His likewise to whom offence had been given. For neither does grace exist, except after offence; nor peace, except after war. Now, both the people (of Israel) by their transgression of His laws,[fn-73-P7362_2122595:205-nf] and the whole race of mankind by their neglect of natural duty,[fn-73-P7363_2122679:206-nf] had both sinned and rebelled against the Creator. Marcion's god, however, could not have been offended, both because he was unknown to everybody, and because he is incapable of being irritated. What grace, therefore, can be had of a god who has not been offended? What peace from one who has never experienced rebellion? \"The cross of Christ,\" he says, \"is to them that perish foolishness; but unto such as shall obtain salvation, it is the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-73-P7364_2123337:207-nf] And then, that we may known from whence this comes, he adds: \"For it is written, `I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.' \"[fn-73-P7365_2123542:208-nf] Now, since these are the Creator's words, and since what pertains to the doctrine[fn-73-P7366_2123665:209-nf] of the cross he accounts as foolishness, therefore both the cross, and also Christ by reason of the cross, will appertain to the Creator, by whom were predicted the incidents of the cross. But if[fn-73-P7367_2123876:210-nf] the Creator, as an enemy, took away their wisdom in order that the cross of Christ, considered as his adversary, should be accounted foolishness, how by any possibility can the Creator have foretold anything about the cross of a Christ who is not His own, and of whom He knew nothing, when He published the prediction? But, again, how happens it, that in the system of a Lord[fn-73-P7368_2124299:211-nf] who is so very good, and so profuse in mercy, some carry off salvation, when they believe the cross to be the wisdom and power of God, whilst others incur perdition, to whom the cross of Christ is accounted folly;-(how happens it, I repeat, ) unless it is in the Creator's dispensation to have punished both the people of Israel and the human race, for some great offence committed against Him, with the loss of wisdom and prudence? What follows will confirm this suggestion, when he asks, \"Hath not God infatuated the wisdom of this world? \"[fn-73-P7369_2124863:212-nf] and when he adds the reason why: \"For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God[fn-73-P7370_2125005:213-nf] by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\"[fn-73-P7371_2125111:214-nf] But first a word about the expression \"the world; \" because in this passage particularly,[fn-73-P7372_2125222:215-nf] the heretics expend a great deal of their subtlety in showing that by world is meant the lord of the world. We, however, understand the term to apply to any person that is in the world, by a simple idiom of human language, which often substitutes that which contains for that which is contained. \"The circus shouted,\" \"The forum spoke,\" and \"The basilica murmured,\" are well-known expressions, meaning that the people in these places did so. Since then the man, not the god, of the world[fn-73-P7373_2125733:216-nf] in his wisdom knew not God, whom indeed he ought to have known (both the Jew by his knowledge of the Scriptures, and all the human race by their knowledge of God's works), therefore that God, who was not acknowledged in His wisdom, resolved to smite men's knowledge with His foolishness, by saving all those who believe in the folly of the preached cross. \"Because the Jews require signs,\" who ought to have already made up their minds about God, \"and the Greeks seek after wisdom,\"[fn-73-P7374_2126290:217-nf] who rely upon their own wisdom, and not upon God's. If, however, it was a new god that was being preached, what sin had the Jews committed, in seeking after signs to believe; or the Greeks, when they hunted after a wisdom which they would prefer to accept? Thus the very retribution which overtook both Jews and Greeks proves that God is both a jealous God and a Judge, inasmuch as He infatuated the world's wisdom by an angry[fn-73-P7375_2126738:218-nf] and a judicial retribution. Since, then, the causes[fn-73-P7376_2126805:219-nf] are in the hands of Him who gave us the Scriptures which we use, it follows that the apostle, when treating of the Creator, (as Him whom both Jew and Gentile as yet have) not known, means undoubtedly to teach us, that the God who is to become known (in Christ) is the Creator. The very \"stumbling-block\" which he declares Christ to be \"to the Jews,\"[fn-73-P7377_2127213:220-nf] points unmistakeably[fn-73-P7378_2127255:221-nf] to the Creator's prophecy respecting Him, when by Isaiah He says: \"Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.\"[fn-73-P7379_2127406:222-nf] This rock or stone is Christ.[fn-73-P7380_2127458:223-nf] This stumbling-stone Marcion retains still.[fn-73-P7381_2127526:224-nf] Now, what is that \"foolishness of God which is wiser than men,\" but the cross and death of Christ? What is that \"weakness of God which is stronger than men,\"[fn-73-P7382_2128294:225-nf] but the nativity and incarnation[fn-73-P7383_2128348:226-nf] of God? If, however, Christ was not born of the Virgin, was not constituted of human flesh, and thereby really suffered neither death nor the cross there was nothing in Him either of foolishness or weakness; nor is it any longer true, that \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; \"nor, again, hath \"God chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty; \"nor \"the base things\" and the least things \"in the world, and things which are despised, which are even as nothing\" (that is, things which really[fn-73-P7384_2128902:227-nf] are not), \"to bring to nothing things which are\" (that is, which really are).[fn-73-P7385_2128993:228-nf] For nothing in the dispensation of God is found to be mean, and ignoble, and contemptible. Such only occurs in man's arrangement. The very Old Testament of the Creator[fn-73-P7386_2129182:229-nf] itself, it is possible, no doubt, to charge with foolishness, and weakness, and dishonour and meanness, and contempt. What is more foolish and more weak than God's requirement of bloody sacrifices and of savoury holocausts? What is weaker than the cleansing of vessels and of beds?[fn-73-P7387_2129560:230-nf] What more dishonourable than the discoloration of the reddening skin?[fn-73-P7388_2129654:231-nf] What so mean as the statute of retaliation? What so contemptible as the exception in meats and drinks? The whole of the Old Testament, the heretic, to the best of my belief, holds in derision. For God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom. Marcion's god has no such discipline, because he does not take after[fn-73-P7389_2130014:232-nf] (the Creator) in the process of confusing opposites by their opposites, so that \"no flesh shall glory; but, as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-73-P7390_2130204:233-nf] In what Lord?

What peace from one who has never experienced rebellion? \"The cross of Christ,\" he says, \"is to them that perish foolishness; but unto such as shall obtain salvation, it is the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-73-P7364_2123337:207-nf] And then, that we may known from whence this comes, he adds: \"For it is written, `I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.' \"[fn-73-P7365_2123542:208-nf] Now, since these are the Creator's words, and since what pertains to the doctrine[fn-73-P7366_2123665:209-nf] of the cross he accounts as foolishness, therefore both the cross, and also Christ by reason of the cross, will appertain to the Creator, by whom were predicted the incidents of the cross. But if[fn-73-P7367_2123876:210-nf] the Creator, as an enemy, took away their wisdom in order that the cross of Christ, considered as his adversary, should be accounted foolishness, how by any possibility can the Creator have foretold anything about the cross of a Christ who is not His own, and of whom He knew nothing, when He published the prediction? But, again, how happens it, that in the system of a Lord[fn-73-P7368_2124299:211-nf] who is so very good, and so profuse in mercy, some carry off salvation, when they believe the cross to be the wisdom and power of God, whilst others incur perdition, to whom the cross of Christ is accounted folly;-(how happens it, I repeat, ) unless it is in the Creator's dispensation to have punished both the people of Israel and the human race, for some great offence committed against Him, with the loss of wisdom and prudence? What follows will confirm this suggestion, when he asks, \"Hath not God infatuated the wisdom of this world? \"[fn-73-P7369_2124863:212-nf] and when he adds the reason why: \"For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God[fn-73-P7370_2125005:213-nf] by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\"[fn-73-P7371_2125111:214-nf] But first a word about the expression \"the world; \" because in this passage particularly,[fn-73-P7372_2125222:215-nf] the heretics expend a great deal of their subtlety in showing that by world is meant the lord of the world. We, however, understand the term to apply to any person that is in the world, by a simple idiom of human language, which often substitutes that which contains for that which is contained. \"The circus shouted,\" \"The forum spoke,\" and \"The basilica murmured,\" are well-known expressions, meaning that the people in these places did so. Since then the man, not the god, of the world[fn-73-P7373_2125733:216-nf] in his wisdom knew not God, whom indeed he ought to have known (both the Jew by his knowledge of the Scriptures, and all the human race by their knowledge of God's works), therefore that God, who was not acknowledged in His wisdom, resolved to smite men's knowledge with His foolishness, by saving all those who believe in the folly of the preached cross. \"Because the Jews require signs,\" who ought to have already made up their minds about God, \"and the Greeks seek after wisdom,\"[fn-73-P7374_2126290:217-nf] who rely upon their own wisdom, and not upon God's. If, however, it was a new god that was being preached, what sin had the Jews committed, in seeking after signs to believe; or the Greeks, when they hunted after a wisdom which they would prefer to accept?

Since, then, the causes[fn-73-P7376_2126805:219-nf] are in the hands of Him who gave us the Scriptures which we use, it follows that the apostle, when treating of the Creator, (as Him whom both Jew and Gentile as yet have) not known, means undoubtedly to teach us, that the God who is to become known (in Christ) is the Creator.

But, again, how happens it, that in the system of a Lord[fn-73-P7368_2124299:211-nf] who is so very good, and so profuse in mercy, some carry off salvation, when they believe the cross to be the wisdom and power of God, whilst others incur perdition, to whom the cross of Christ is accounted folly;-(how happens it, I repeat, ) unless it is in the Creator's dispensation to have punished both the people of Israel and the human race, for some great offence committed against Him, with the loss of wisdom and prudence?

But, again, how happens it, that in the system of a Lord[fn-73-P7368_2124299:211-nf] who is so very good, and so profuse in mercy, some carry off salvation, when they believe the cross to be the wisdom and power of God, whilst others incur perdition, to whom the cross of Christ is accounted folly;-(how happens it, I repeat, ) unless it is in the Creator's dispensation to have punished both the people of Israel and the human race, for some great offence committed against Him, with the loss of wisdom and prudence?

But, again, how happens it, that in the system of a Lord[fn-73-P7368_2124299:211-nf] who is so very good, and so profuse in mercy, some carry off salvation, when they believe the cross to be the wisdom and power of God, whilst others incur perdition, to whom the cross of Christ is accounted folly;-(how happens it, I repeat, ) unless it is in the Creator's dispensation to have punished both the people of Israel and the human race, for some great offence committed against Him, with the loss of wisdom and prudence? What follows will confirm this suggestion, when he asks, \"Hath not God infatuated the wisdom of this world? \"[fn-73-P7369_2124863:212-nf] and when he adds the reason why: \"For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God[fn-73-P7370_2125005:213-nf] by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\"[fn-73-P7371_2125111:214-nf] But first a word about the expression \"the world; \" because in this passage particularly,[fn-73-P7372_2125222:215-nf] the heretics expend a great deal of their subtlety in showing that by world is meant the lord of the world.

Since then the man, not the god, of the world[fn-73-P7373_2125733:216-nf] in his wisdom knew not God, whom indeed he ought to have known (both the Jew by his knowledge of the Scriptures, and all the human race by their knowledge of God's works), therefore that God, who was not acknowledged in His wisdom, resolved to smite men's knowledge with His foolishness, by saving all those who believe in the folly of the preached cross. \"Because the Jews require signs,\" who ought to have already made up their minds about God, \"and the Greeks seek after wisdom,\"[fn-73-P7374_2126290:217-nf] who rely upon their own wisdom, and not upon God's. If, however, it was a new god that was being preached, what sin had the Jews committed, in seeking after signs to believe; or the Greeks, when they hunted after a wisdom which they would prefer to accept? Thus the very retribution which overtook both Jews and Greeks proves that God is both a jealous God and a Judge, inasmuch as He infatuated the world's wisdom by an angry[fn-73-P7375_2126738:218-nf] and a judicial retribution. Since, then, the causes[fn-73-P7376_2126805:219-nf] are in the hands of Him who gave us the Scriptures which we use, it follows that the apostle, when treating of the Creator, (as Him whom both Jew and Gentile as yet have) not known, means undoubtedly to teach us, that the God who is to become known (in Christ) is the Creator. The very \"stumbling-block\" which he declares Christ to be \"to the Jews,\"[fn-73-P7377_2127213:220-nf] points unmistakeably[fn-73-P7378_2127255:221-nf] to the Creator's prophecy respecting Him, when by Isaiah He says: \"Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.\"[fn-73-P7379_2127406:222-nf] This rock or stone is Christ.[fn-73-P7380_2127458:223-nf] This stumbling-stone Marcion retains still.[fn-73-P7381_2127526:224-nf] Now, what is that \"foolishness of God which is wiser than men,\" but the cross and death of Christ?

If, however, Christ was not born of the Virgin, was not constituted of human flesh, and thereby really suffered neither death nor the cross there was nothing in Him either of foolishness or weakness; nor is it any longer true, that \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; \"nor, again, hath \"God chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty; \"nor \"the base things\" and the least things \"in the world, and things which are despised, which are even as nothing\" (that is, things which really[fn-73-P7384_2128902:227-nf] are not), \"to bring to nothing things which are\" (that is, which really are).[fn-73-P7385_2128993:228-nf] For nothing in the dispensation of God is found to be mean, and ignoble, and contemptible. Such only occurs in man's arrangement. The very Old Testament of the Creator[fn-73-P7386_2129182:229-nf] itself, it is possible, no doubt, to charge with foolishness, and weakness, and dishonour and meanness, and contempt. What is more foolish and more weak than God's requirement of bloody sacrifices and of savoury holocausts? What is weaker than the cleansing of vessels and of beds?[fn-73-P7387_2129560:230-nf] What more dishonourable than the discoloration of the reddening skin?[fn-73-P7388_2129654:231-nf] What so mean as the statute of retaliation? What so contemptible as the exception in meats and drinks? The whole of the Old Testament, the heretic, to the best of my belief, holds in derision. For God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom. Marcion's god has no such discipline, because he does not take after[fn-73-P7389_2130014:232-nf] (the Creator) in the process of confusing opposites by their opposites, so that \"no flesh shall glory; but, as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-73-P7390_2130204:233-nf] In what Lord?

The point, then, is, that it is not (the usual) health which the apostle prescribes for those to whom he writes, but \"grace and peace.\"[fn-73-P7354_2120892:197-nf] I do not ask, indeed, what a destroyer of Judaism has to do with a formula which the Jews still use. For to this day they salute each other[fn-73-P7355_2121052:198-nf] with the greeting of \"peace,\" and formerly in their Scriptures they did the same. But I understand him by his practice[fn-73-P7356_2121189:199-nf] plainly enough to have corroborated the declaration of the Creator: \"How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good, who preach the gospel of peace!\"[fn-73-P7357_2121375:200-nf] For the herald of good, that is, of God's \"grace\" was well aware that along with it \"peace\" also was to be proclaimed.[fn-73-P7358_2121514:201-nf] Now, when he announces these blessings as \"from God the Father and the Lord Jesus,\"[fn-73-P7359_2121630:202-nf] he uses titles that are common to both, and which are also adapted to the mystery of our faith;[fn-73-P7360_2121746:203-nf] and I suppose it to be impossible accurately to determine what God is declared to be the Father and the Lord Jesus, unless (we consider) which of their accruing attributes are more suited to them severally.[fn-73-P7361_2122000:204-nf] First, then, I assert that none other than the Creator and Sustainer of both man and the universe can be acknowledged as Father and Lord; next, that to the Father also the title of Lord accrues by reason of His power, and that the Son too receives the same through the Father; then that \"grace and peace\" are not only His who had them published, but His likewise to whom offence had been given. For neither does grace exist, except after offence; nor peace, except after war. Now, both the people (of Israel) by their transgression of His laws,[fn-73-P7362_2122595:205-nf] and the whole race of mankind by their neglect of natural duty,[fn-73-P7363_2122679:206-nf] had both sinned and rebelled against the Creator. Marcion's god, however, could not have been offended, both because he was unknown to everybody, and because he is incapable of being irritated. What grace, therefore, can be had of a god who has not been offended? What peace from one who has never experienced rebellion? \"The cross of Christ,\" he says, \"is to them that perish foolishness; but unto such as shall obtain salvation, it is the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-73-P7364_2123337:207-nf] And then, that we may known from whence this comes, he adds: \"For it is written, `I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.' \"[fn-73-P7365_2123542:208-nf] Now, since these are the Creator's words, and since what pertains to the doctrine[fn-73-P7366_2123665:209-nf] of the cross he accounts as foolishness, therefore both the cross, and also Christ by reason of the cross, will appertain to the Creator, by whom were predicted the incidents of the cross.

But because (the apostle) subjoins, on the subject of our glory, that \"none of the princes of this world knew it for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,\"[fn-74-P7409_2134549:248-nf] the heretic argues that the princes of this world crucified the Lord (that is, the Christ of the rival god) in order that this blow might even recoil[fn-74-P7410_2134720:249-nf] on the Creator Himself. Any one, however, who has seen from what we have already said how our glory must be regarded as issuing from the Creator, will already have come to the conclusion that, inasmuch as the Creator settled it in His own secret purpose, it properly enough was unknown to all the princes[fn-74-P7411_2135051:250-nf] and powers of the Creator, on the principle that servants are not permitted to know their masters' plans, much less the fallen angels and the leader of transgression himself, the devil; for I should contend that these, on account of their fall, were greater strangers still to any knowledge of the Creator's dispensations. But it is no longer open to me[fn-74-P7412_2135424:251-nf] even to interpret the princes and powers of this world as the Creator's, since the apostle imputes ignorance to them, whereas even the devil according to our Gospel recognised Jesus in the temptation,[fn-74-P7413_2135659:252-nf] and, according to the record which is common to both (Marcionites and ourselves) the evil spirit knew that Jesus was the Holy One of God, and that Jesus was His name, and that He was come to destroy them.[fn-74-P7414_2135887:253-nf] The parable also of the strong man armed, whom a stronger than he overcame and seized his goods, is admitted by Marcion to have reference to the Creator:[fn-74-P7415_2136061:254-nf] therefore the Creator could not have been ignorant any longer of the God of glory, since He is overcome by him;[fn-74-P7416_2136219:255-nf] nor could He have crucified him whom He was unable to cope with. The inevitable inference, therefore, as it seems to me, is that we must believe that the princes and powers of the Creator did knowingly crucify the God of glory in His Christ, with that desperation and excessive malice with which the most abandoned slaves do not even hesitate to slay their masters. For it is written in my Gospel[fn-74-P7417_2136672:256-nf] that \"Satan entered into Judas.\"[fn-74-P7418_2136721:257-nf] According to Marcion, however, the apostle in the passage under consideration[fn-74-P7419_2136820:258-nf] does not allow the imputation of ignorance, with respect to the Lord of glory, to the powers of the Creator; because, indeed, he will have it that these are not meant by \"the princes of this world.\" But (the apostle) evidently[fn-74-P7420_2137068:259-nf] did not speak of spiritual princes; so that he meant secular ones, those of the princely people, (chief in the divine dispensation, although) not, of course, amongst the nations of the world, and their rulers, and king Herod, and even Pilate, and, as represented by him,[fn-74-P7421_2137355:260-nf] that power of Rome which was the greatest in the world, and then presided over by him. Thus the arguments of the other side are pulled down, and our own proofs are thereby built up. But you still maintain that our glory comes from your god, with whom it also lay in secret. Then why does your god employ the self-same Scripture[fn-74-P7422_2137698:261-nf] which the apostle also relies on? What has your god to do at all with the sayings of the prophets? \"Who hath discovered the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-74-P7423_2137895:262-nf] So says Isaiah. What has he also to do with illustrations from our God? For when (the apostle) calls himself \"a wise master-builder,\"[fn-74-P7424_2138049:263-nf] we find that the Creator by Isaiah designates the teacher who sketches[fn-74-P7425_2138143:264-nf] out the divine discipline by the same title, \"I will take away from Judah the cunning artificer,\"[fn-74-P7426_2138262:265-nf] etc. And was it not Paul himself who was there foretold, destined \"to be taken away from Judah\"-that is, from Judaism-for the erection of Christianity, in order \"to lay that only foundation, which is Christ? \"[fn-74-P7427_2138584:266-nf] Of this work the Creator also by the same prophet says, \"Behold, I lay in Sion for a foundation a precious stone and honourable; and he that resteth thereon shall not be confounded.\"[fn-74-P7428_2138790:267-nf] Unless it be, that God professed Himself to be the builder up of an earthly work, that so He might not give any sign of His Christ, as destined to be the foundation of such as believe in Him, upon which every man should build at will the superstructure of either sound or worthless doctrine; forasmuch as it is the Creator's function, when a man's work shall be tried by fire, (or) when a reward shall be recompensed to him by fire; because it is by fire that the test is applied to the building which you erect upon the foundation which is laid by Him, that is, the foundation of His Christ.[fn-74-P7429_2139407:268-nf] \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \"[fn-74-P7430_2140182:269-nf] Now, since man is the property, and the work, and the image and likeness of the Creator, having his flesh, formed by Him of the ground, and his soul of His afflatus, it follows that Marcion's god wholly dwells in a temple which belongs to another, if so be we are not the Creator's temple. But \"if any man defile the temple of God, he shall be himself destroyed\"[fn-74-P7431_2140568:270-nf] -of course, by the God of the temple.[fn-74-P7432_2140658:271-nf] If you threaten an avenger, you threaten us with the Creator. \"Ye must become fools, that ye may be wise.\"[fn-74-P7433_2140788:272-nf] Wherefore? \"Because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.\"[fn-74-P7434_2140882:273-nf] With what God? Even if the ancient Scriptures have contributed nothing in support of our view thus far,[fn-74-P7435_2141009:274-nf] an excellent testimony turns up in what (the apostle) here adjoins: \"For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\"[fn-74-P7436_2141337:275-nf] For in general we may conclude for certain that he could not possibly have cited the authority of that God whom he was bound to destroy, since he would not teach for Him.[fn-74-P7437_2141560:276-nf] \"Therefore,\" says he, \"let no man glory in man; \"[fn-74-P7438_2141638:277-nf] an injunction which is in accordance with the teaching of the Creator, \"wretched is the man that trusteth in man; \"[fn-74-P7439_2141777:278-nf] again, \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in man; \"[fn-74-P7440_2141866:279-nf] and the same thing is said about glorying (in princes).[fn-74-P7441_2141944:280-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I am accustomed in my prescription against all heresies, to fix my compendious criterion[fn-80-P8066_2292235:865-nf] (of truth) in the testimony of time; claiming priority therein as our rule, and alleging lateness to be the characteristic of every heresy. This shall now be proved even by the apostle, when he says: \"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; which is come unto you, as it is unto all the world.\"[fn-80-P8067_2292629:866-nf] For if, even at that time, the tradition of the gospel had spread everywhere, how much more now!

But should Marcion's gospel succeed in filling the whole world, it would not even in that case be entitled to the character of apostolic. For this quality, it will be evident, can only belong to that gospel which was the first to fill the world; in other words, to the gospel of that God who of old declared this of its promulgation: \"Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8069_2293434:868-nf] He calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-80-P8070_2293503:869-nf] We in like manner say that the Father of Christ is invisible, for we know that it was the Son who was seen in ancient times (whenever any appearance was vouchsafed to men in the name of God) as the image of (the Father) Himself. He must not be regarded, however, as making any difference between a visible and an invisible God; because long before he wrote this we find a description of our God to this effect: \"No man can see the Lord, and live.\"[fn-80-P8071_2293970:870-nf] If Christ is not \"the first-begotten before every creature,\"[fn-80-P8072_2294054:871-nf] as that \"Word of God by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-80-P8073_2294295:872-nf] if \"all things were\" not \"in Him created, whether in heaven or on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; \"if \"all things were\" not \"created by Him and for Him\" (for these truths Marcion ought not to allow concerning Him), then the apostle could not have so positively laid it down, that \"He is before all.\"[fn-80-P8074_2294679:873-nf] For how is He before all, if He is not before all things?[fn-80-P8075_2294756:874-nf] How, again, is He before all things, if He is not \"the first-born of every creature\"-if He is not the Word of the Creator?[fn-80-P8076_2294898:875-nf] Now how will he be proved to have been before all things, who appeared after all things?

In what way also could it have \"pleased (the Father) that in Him should all fulness dwell? \"[fn-80-P8077_2295227:876-nf] For, to begin with, what fulness is that which is not comprised of the constituents which Marcion has removed from it,-even those that were \"created in Christ, whether in heaven or on earth,\" whether angels or men? which is not made of the things that are visible and invisible? which consists not of thrones and dominions and principalities and powers? If, on the other hand,[fn-80-P8078_2295623:877-nf] our false apostles and Judaizing gospellers[fn-80-P8079_2295682:878-nf] have introduced all these things out of their own stores, and Martian has applied them to constitute the fulness of his own god, (this hypothesis, absurd though it be, alone would justify him; ) for how, on any other supposition,[fn-80-P8080_2295937:879-nf] could the rival and the destroyer of the Creator have been willing that His fulness should dwell in his Christ? To whom, again, does He \"reconcile all things by Himself, making peace by the blood of His cross,\"[fn-80-P8081_2296170:880-nf] but to Him whom those very things had altogether[fn-80-P8082_2296238:881-nf] offended, against whom they had rebelled by transgression, (but) to whom they had at last returned?[fn-80-P8083_2296397:882-nf] Conciliated they might have been to a strange god; but reconciled they could not possibly have been to any other than their own God. Accordingly, ourselves \"who were sometime alienated and enemies in our mind by wicked works\"[fn-80-P8084_2296655:883-nf] does He reconcile to the Creator, against whom we had committed offence-worshipping the creature to the prejudice of the Creator. As, however, he says elsewhere,[fn-80-P8085_2296836:884-nf] that the Church is the body of Christ, so here also (the apostle) declares that he \"fills up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church.\"[fn-80-P8086_2297054:885-nf] But you must not on this account suppose that on every mention of His body the term is only a metaphor, instead of meaning real flesh. For he says above that we are \"reconciled in His body through death; \"[fn-80-P8087_2297279:886-nf] meaning, of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore he adds, ) not through the Church[fn-80-P8088_2297435:887-nf] (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church (proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body-one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again, he warns them to \"beware of subtle words and philosophy,\" as being \"a vain deceit,\" such as is \"after the rudiments of the world\" (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of sky and earth, but worldly learning, and \"the tradition of men,\" subtle in their speech and their philosophy),[fn-80-P8089_2297958:888-nf] it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to show how in this sentence (of the apostle's) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus, implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;[fn-80-P8090_2298372:889-nf] wherefore he refuses to say that He is an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and places it on a par with the Divine Creator.[fn-80-P8091_2299157:890-nf] He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,-a truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.[fn-80-P8092_2299442:891-nf] But how remote is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that Christ was born of the virgin's womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very heathen, laugh and jeer. For \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise\"[fn-80-P8093_2300031:892-nf] -that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His threatened long before that He would \"destroy the wisdom of the wise.\"[fn-80-P8094_2300194:893-nf] Thanks to this simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God. When, therefore, he speaks of their \"following the commandments and doctrines of men,\"[fn-80-P8098_2302162:897-nf] he refers to the conduct of those persons who \"held not the Head,\" even Him in whom all things are gathered together;[fn-80-P8099_2302300:898-nf] for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him as their initiating principle[fn-81-P8100_2302423:899-nf] -even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their nature. All the rest of his precepts,[fn-81-P8101_2302536:900-nf] as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them as they occurred in another epistle,[fn-81-P8102_2302664:901-nf] emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting that \"old things were to pass away,\" and that He would \"make all things new,\"[fn-81-P8103_2302902:902-nf] commanded men \"to break up fresh ground for themselves,\"[fn-81-P8104_2303013:903-nf] and thereby taught them even then to put off the old man and put on the new.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I am accustomed in my prescription against all heresies, to fix my compendious criterion[fn-80-P8066_2292235:865-nf] (of truth) in the testimony of time; claiming priority therein as our rule, and alleging lateness to be the characteristic of every heresy.

Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God. When, therefore, he speaks of their \"following the commandments and doctrines of men,\"[fn-80-P8098_2302162:897-nf] he refers to the conduct of those persons who \"held not the Head,\" even Him in whom all things are gathered together;[fn-80-P8099_2302300:898-nf] for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him as their initiating principle[fn-81-P8100_2302423:899-nf] -even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their nature. All the rest of his precepts,[fn-81-P8101_2302536:900-nf] as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them as they occurred in another epistle,[fn-81-P8102_2302664:901-nf] emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting that \"old things were to pass away,\" and that He would \"make all things new,\"[fn-81-P8103_2302902:902-nf] commanded men \"to break up fresh ground for themselves,\"[fn-81-P8104_2303013:903-nf] and thereby taught them even then to put off the old man and put on the new.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"20. And men are easily offended in a matter of this kind, just in proportion as they are weak; and they are weak just in proportion as they wish to seem learned, not in the knowledge of things which tend to edification, but in that of signs, by which it is hard not to be puffed up,[fn-48-P4889_2642295:29-nf] seeing that the knowledge of things even would often set up our neck, if it were not held down by the yoke of our Master.

Again, that phrase, which we cannot now take away from the lips of the people who sing it: \"Super ipsum autem floriet sanctificatio mea,\"[fn-48-P4891_2643069:31-nf] surely takes away nothing from the meaning. Yet a more learned man would prefer that this should be corrected, and that we should say, not floriet, but florebit. Nor does anything stand in the way of the correction being made, except the usage of the singers. Mistakes of this kind, then, if a man do not choose to avoid them altogether, it is easy to treat with indifference, as not interfering with a right understanding.

For not only is such a form of speech faulty in the Latin tongue, but it is ambiguous too, as if the meaning might be, that the folly of men or the weakness of men is wiser or stronger than that of God. But indeed even the expression sapientius est hominibus (stronger than men) is not free from ambiguity, even though it be free from solecism. For whether hominibus is put as the plural of the dative or as the plural of the ablative, does not appear, unless by reference to the meaning. It would be better then to say, sapientius est guam homines, and fortius est quamhomines.","title":"Book II","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"121","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Solomon in the Proverbs: \"The Lord established[fn-81-P8142_2701098:118-nf] me in the beginning of His ways, into His works: before the world He rounded me.

In so far as the Lord intimates, we find a probable reason. For we ought to understand that Nathanael was learned and skilled in the law and for that reason was the Lord unwilling to place him among His disciples, because He chose unlearned persons, that He might by them confound the world. Listen to the apostle speaking these things: \"For ye see,\" saith he, \"your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things that are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, as though they were things that are, to bring to nought things that are.[fn-5-P537_236733:22-nf] If a learned man had been chosen, perhaps he would have said that he was chosen for the reason that his learning made him worthy of choice.

Great was Cyprian as an orator, but before him was Peter the fisherman, by means of whom not only the orator, but also the emperor, should believe. No noble was chosen in the first place, no learned man, because God chose the weak things of the world that He might confound the strong. This man, then, was great and without guile, and for this reason only was not chosen, lest the Lord should seem to any to have chosen the learned. And from this same learning in the law, it came that when he heard \"from Nazareth,\"- for he had searched the Scripture, and knew that the Saviour was to be expected thence, what the other scribes and Pharisees had difficulty in knowing,-this man, then, very learned in the law, when he heard Philip saying, \"We have found Him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph; \"-this man, who knew the Scriptures excellently well, when he heard the name \"Nazareth,\" was filled with hope, and said, \"From Nazareth something good can come.\"","title":"Tractate VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_27_book_v_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"251","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"196.

If we look at the things by the names of which the Son of God is called, we shall understand how many good things Jesus is, whom those preach whose feet are beautiful. One good thing is life; but Jesus is the life. Another good thing is the light of the world, when it is true light, and the light of men; and all these things the Son of God is said to be. And another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition to life or light is the truth. And a fourth in addition to time is the way which leads to the truth. And all these things our Saviour teaches that He is, when He says:[fn-61-P6173_952885:47-nf] \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and to rise again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the resurrection, as He says:[fn-61-P6174_953098:48-nf] \"I am the resurrection.\" But the door also is a good, through which one enters into the highest blessedness. Now Christ says:[fn-61-P6175_953241:49-nf] \"I am the door.\" And what need is there to speak of wisdom, which \"the Lord created[fn-61-P6176_953341:50-nf] the first principle of His ways, for His works,\" in whom the father of her rejoiced. delighting in her manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of the mind alone, and provoking him to love who discerns her divine and heavenly charm? A good indeed is the wisdom of God, proclaimed along with the other good foresaid by those whose feet are beautiful. And the power of God is the eighth good we enumerate, which is Christ. Nor must we omit to mention the Word, who is God after the Father of all. For this also is a good, less than no other. Happy, then, are those who accept these goods and receive them from those who announce the good tidings of them, those whose feet are beautiful. Indeed even one of the Corinthians to whom Paul declared that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, should he learn Him who for our sakes became man, and so receive Him, he would become identified with the beginning of the good things we have spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a man of God, and by His death he would die to sin. For \"Christ,[fn-61-P6177_954418:51-nf] in that He died, died unto sin once.\" But from His life, since \"in that He liveth, He liveth unto God,\" every one who is conformed to His resurrection receives that living to God. But who will deny that righteousness, essential righteousness, is a good, and essential sanctification, and essential redemption? And these things those preach who preach Jesus, saying[fn-61-P6178_954801:52-nf] that He is made to be of God righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Hence we shall have writings about Him without number, showing that Jesus is a multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which actually exist in Him in whom[fn-61-P6179_955156:53-nf] \"it pleased God that the whole fulness of the Godhead should dwell bodily.\" and which are not contained in writings. Why should I say, \"are not contained in writings\"? For John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and says:[fn-61-P6180_955412:54-nf] \"I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books which would be written.\" Now to say that the Apostles preach the Saviour is to say that they preach these good things. For this is He who received from the good Father that He Himself should be these good things, so that each man receiving from Jesus the thing or things he is capable of receiving may enjoy good things. But the Apostles, whose feet were beautiful, and those imitators of them who sought to preach the good tidings, could not have done so had not Jesus Himself first preached the good tidings to them, as Isaiah says:[fn-61-P6181_956032:55-nf] \"I myself that speak am here, as the opportunity on the mountains, as the feet of one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching good things; for I will make My salvation to be heard, saying, God shall reign over thee, O Zion!\" For what are the mountains on which the speaker declares that He Himself is present, but those who are less than none of the highest and the greatest of the earth? And these must be sought by the able ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may observe the injunction which says:[fn-61-P6182_956570:56-nf] Go up into a high mountain, thou that preachest good tidings to Zion; thou that preachest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength!\" Now it is not wonderful if to those who are to preach good tidings Jesus Himself preaches good tidings of good things, which are no other than Himself; for the Son of God preaches the good tidings of Himself to those who cannot come to know Him through others. And He who goes up into the mountains and preaches good things to them, being Himself instructed by His good Father,[fn-61-P6183_957116:57-nf] who \"makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust,\" He does not despise those who are poor in soul. To them He preaches good tidings, as He Himself bears witness to us when He takes Isaiah[fn-61-P6184_957374:58-nf] and reads: \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor, He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind.

Come now, beginning from the nativity itself, declaim[fn-93-P9301_2552457:49-nf] against the uncleanness of the generative elements within the womb, the filthy concretion of fluid and blood, of the growth of the flesh for nine: months long out of that very mire. Describe the womb as it enlarges[fn-93-P9302_2552742:50-nf] from day to day, heavy, troublesome, restless even in sleep, changeful in its feelings of dislike and desire. Inveigh now likewise against the shame itself of a woman in travail[fn-93-P9303_2552940:51-nf] which, however, ought rather to be honoured in consideration of that peril, or to be held sacred[fn-93-P9304_2553053:52-nf] in respect of (the mystery of) nature. Of course you are horrified also at the infant, which is shed into life with the embarrassments which accompany it from the womb;[fn-93-P9305_2553239:53-nf] you likewise, of course, loathe it even after it is washed, when it is dressed out in its swaddling-clothes, graced with repeated anointing,[fn-93-P9306_2553417:54-nf] smiled on with nurse's fawns. This reverend course of nature,[fn-93-P9307_2553506:55-nf] you, O Marcion, (are pleased to) spit upon; and yet, in what way were you born? You detest a human being at his birth; then after what fashion do you love anybody? Yourself, of course, you had no love of, when you departed from the Church and the faith of Christ. But never mind,[fn-93-P9308_2553924:56-nf] if you are not on good terms with yourself, or even if you were born in a way different from other people. Christ, at any rate, has loved even that man who was condensed in his mother's womb amidst all its uncleannesses, even that man who was brought into life out of the said womb, even that man who was nursed amidst the nurse's simpers.[fn-93-P9309_2554278:57-nf] For his sake He came down (from heaven), for his sake He preached, for his sake \"He humbled Himself even unto death-the death of the cross.\"[fn-93-P9310_2554677:58-nf] He loved, of course, the being whom He redeemed at so great a cost. If Christ is the Creator's Son, it was with justice that He loved His own (creature); if He comes from another god, His love was excessive, since He redeemed a being who belonged to another. Well, then, loving man He loved his nativity also, and his flesh as well. Nothing can be loved apart from that through which whatever exists has its existence. Either take away nativity, and then show us your man; or else withdraw the flesh, and then present to our view the being whom God has redeemed-since it is these very conditions[fn-93-P9311_2555291:59-nf] which constitute the man whom God has redeemed. And are you for turning these conditions into occasions of blushing to the very creature whom He has redeemed, (censuring them), too, us unworthy of Him who certainly would not have redeemed them had He not loved them? Our birth He reforms from death by a second birth from heaven;[fn-93-P9312_2555667:60-nf] our flesh He restores from every harassing malady; when leprous, He cleanses it of the stain; when blind, He rekindles its light; when palsied, He renews its strength; when possessed with devils, He exorcises it; when dead, He reanimates it,-then shall we blush to own it? If, to be sure,[fn-93-P9313_2556002:61-nf] He had chosen to be born of a mere animal, and were to preach the kingdom of heaven invested with the body of a beast either wild or tame, your censure (I imagine) would have instantly met Him with this demurrer: \"This is disgraceful for God, and this is unworthy of the Son of God, and simply foolish.\" For no other reason than because one thus judges. It is of course foolish, if we are to judge God by our own conceptions. But, Marcion, consider well this Scripture, if indeed you have not erased it: \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise.\"[fn-93-P9314_2556682:62-nf] Now what are those foolish things? Are they the conversion of men to the worship of the true God, the rejection of error, the whole training in righteousness, chastity, mercy, patience, and innocence? These things certainly are not \"foolish.\" Inquire again, then, of what things he spoke, and when you imagine that you have discovered what they are will you find anything to be so \"foolish\" as believing in a God that has been born, and that of a virgin, and of a fleshly nature too, who wallowed in all the before-mentioned humiliations of nature? But some one may say, \"These are not the foolish things; they must be other things which God has chosen to confound the wisdom of the world.\" And yet, according to the world's wisdom, it is more easy to believe that Jupiter became a bull or a swan, if we listen to Marcion, than that Christ really became a man.","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But in defending free will they hasten to confide rather in it for doing righteousness than in God's aid, and to glory every one in himself, and not in the Lord.[fn-50-P5042_1990525:2-nf] But who of us will say that by the sin of the first man free will perished from the human race? Through sin freedom indeed perished, but it was that freedom which was in Paradise, to have a full righteousness with immortality; and it is on this account that human nature needs divine grace, since the Lord says, \"If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed\"[fn-50-P5043_1990917:3-nf] -free of course to live well and righteously. For free will in the sinner up to this extent did not perish,-that by it all sin, especially they who sin with delight and with love of sin; what they are pleased to do gives them pleasure.

For every one agrees that the Universe is linked to one First Cause; that nothing in it owes its existence to itself, so as to be its own origin and cause; but that there is on the other hand a single uncreate eternal Essence, the same for ever, which transcends all our ideas of distance, conceived of as without increase or decrease, and beyond the scope of any definition; and that time and space with all their consequences, and anything previous to these that thought can grasp in the intelligible supramundane world, are all the productions of this Essence. Well, then, we affirm that human nature is one of these productions; and a word of the inspired Teaching helps us in this, which declares that when God had brought all things else upon the scene of life, man was exhibited upon the earth, a mixture from Divine sources, the godlike intellectual essence being in him united with the several portions of earthly elements contributed towards his formation, and that he was fashioned by his Maker to be the incarnate likeness of Divine transcendent Power. It would be better however to quote the very words: \"And God created man, in the image of God created He him[fn-29-P2930_1973672:15-nf] .\" Now the reason of the making of this animate being has been given by certain writers previous to us as follows. The whole creation is divided into two parts; that \"which is seen,\" and that \"which is not seen,\" to use the Apostle's words (the second meaning the intelligible and immaterial, the first, the sensible and material); and being thus divided, the angelic and spiritual natures, which are among \"the things not seen,\" reside in places above the world, and above the heavens, because such a residence is in correspondence with their constitution; for an intellectual nature is a fine, clear, unencumbered, agile kind of thing, and a heavenly body is fine and light, and perpetually moving, and the earth on the contrary, which stands last in the list of things sensible, can never be an adequate and congenial spot for creatures intellectual to sojourn in. For what correspondence can there possibly be between that which is light and buoyant, on the one hand, and that which is heavy and gravitating on the other? Well, in order that the earth may not be completely devoid of the local indwelling of the intellectual and the immaterial, man (these writers tell us) was fashioned by the Supreme forethought, and his earthy parts moulded over the intellectual and godlike essence of his soul; and so this amalgamation with that which has material weight enables the soul to live on this element of earth, which possesses a certain bond of kindred with the substance of the flesh. The design of all that is being born[fn-29-P2931_1975216:16-nf] , then, is that the Power which is above both the heavenly and the earthly universe may in all parts of the creation be glorified by means of intellectual natures, conspiring to the same end by virtue of the same faculty in operation in all, I mean that of looking upon God. But this operation of looking upon God is nothing less than the life-nourishment appropriate, as like to like, to an intellectual nature. For just as these bodies, earthy as they are, are preserved by nourishment that is earthy, and we detect in them all alike, whether brute or reasoning, the operations of a material kind of vitality, so it is right to assume that there is an intellectual life-nourishment as well, by which such natures[fn-29-P2932_1976033:17-nf] are maintained in existence. But if bodily food, coming and going as it does in circulation, nevertheless imparts a certain amount of vital energy to those who get it, how much more does the partaking of the real thing, always remaining and always the same, preserve the eater in existence? If, then, this is the life-nourishment of an intellectual nature, namely, to have a part in God, this part will not be gained by that which is of an opposite quality; the would-be partaker must? some degree be akin to that which is to be partaken of. The eye enjoys the light by virtue of having light within itself to seize its kindred light, and the finger or any other limb cannot effect the act of vision because none of this natural light is organized in any of them. The same necessity requires that in our partaking of God there should be some kinship in the constitution of the partaker with that which is partaken of. Therefore, as the Scripture says, man was made in the image of God; that like, I take it, might be able to see like; and to see God is, as was said above, the life of the soul. But seeing that ignorance of the true good is like a mist that obscures the visual keenness of the soul, and that when that mist grows denser a cloud is formed so thick that Truth's ray cannot pierce through these depths of ignorance, it follows further that with the total deprivation of the light the soul's life ceases altogether; for we have said that the real life of the soul is acted out in partaking of the Good; but when ignorance hinders this apprehension of God, the soul which thus ceases to partake of God, ceases also to live. But no one can force us to give the family history[fn-29-P2933_1978013:18-nf] of this ignorance, asking whence and from what father it is; let him be given to understand from the word itself that \"ignorance\" and \"knowledge\" indicate one of the relations of the soul;[fn-29-P2934_1978220:19-nf] but no relation, whether expressed or not, conveys the idea of substance; a relation and a substance are quite of different descriptions. If, then, knowledge is not a substance, but a perfected[fn-29-P2935_1978452:20-nf] operation of the soul, it must be conceded that ignorance must be much farther removed still from anything in the way of substance; but that which is not in that way does not exist at all; and so it would be useless to trouble ourselves about where it comes from. Now seeing that the Word[fn-29-P2936_1978836:21-nf] declares that the living in God is the life of the soul, and seeing that this living is knowledge according to each man's ability, and that ignorance does not imply the reality of anything, but is only the negation of the operation of knowing, and seeing that upon this partaking in God being no longer effected there follows at once the cancelling of the soul's life, which is the worst of evils,-because of all this the Producer of all Good would work in us the cure of such an evil. A cure is a good thing, but one who does not look to the evangelic mystery would still be ignorant of the manner of the cure. We have shown that alienation from God, Who is the Life, is an evil; the cure, then, of this infirmity is, again to be made friends with God, and so to be in life once more. When such a life, then, is always held up in hope before humanity, it cannot be said that the winning of this life is absolutely a reward of a good life, and that the contrary is a punishment (of a bad one); but what we insist on resembles the case of the eyes. We do not say that one who has clear eyesight is rewarded as with a prize by being able to perceive the objects of sight; nor on the other hand that he who has diseased eyes experiences a failure of optic activity as the result of some penal sentence. With the eye in a natural state sight follows necessarily; with it vitiated by disease failure of sight as necessarily follows. In the same way the life of blessedness is as a familiar second nature to those who have kept clear the senses of the soul; but when the blinding stream of ignorance prevents our partaking in the real light, then it necessarily follows that we miss that, the enjoyment of which we declare to be the life of the partaker.","title":"On Infants' Early Deaths","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_39_fragments_of_the_fourth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2. The Apostles are not unaware that in some things they give offence, and that in some respects their culture is defective, and they confess themselves[fn-66-P6641_1160077:2-nf] accordingly to be rude in speech but not in knowledge; for we must consider that the other Apostles would have said this, too, as well as Paul.

By \"treasures\" we understand here, as in other passages, the treasure of knowledge (gnosis) and of hidden wisdom. By \"earthen vessels\" we understand the humble diction of the Scriptures, which the Greek might so readily be led to despise, and in which the excellency of God's power appears so clearly. The mystery of the truth and the power of the things said were not hindered by the humble diction from travelling to the ends of the earth, nor from subduing to the word of Christ, not only the foolish things of the world, but sometimes its wise things, too. For we see our calling,[fn-66-P6643_1160996:4-nf] not that no wise man according to the flesh, but that not many wise according to the flesh.

For he was made sufficient[fn-66-P6645_1161352:6-nf] by God to be a minister of the New Covenant, wielding the demonstration of the spirit and of power, so that when the believers agreed with him their belief should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. For, perhaps, if the Scripture possessed, like the works the Greeks admire, elegance and command of diction, then it would be open to suppose that not the truth of them had laid hold of men, but that the apparent sequence and splendour of language had carried off the hearers, and had carried them off by guile.","title":"Fragments of the Fourth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_38_on_patience","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"17. Now this election the Apostle demonstrating to be, not of merits going before in good works, but election of grace, saith thus: \"And in this time a remnant by election of grace is saved. But if by grace, then is itno more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-47-P4787_2358854:46-nf] This is election of grace; that is, election in which through the grace of God men are elected: this, I say, is election of grace which goes before all good merits of men. For if it be to any good merits that it is given, then is it no more gratuitously given, but is paid as a debt, and consequently is not truly called grace; where \"reward,\" as the same Apostle saith, \"is not imputed as grace, but as debt.\"[fn-47-P4788_2359285:47-nf] Whereas if, that it may be true grace, that is, gratuitous, it find nothing inman to which it is due of merit, (which thing is well understood in that saying, \"Thou wiltsave them for nothing,\"[fn-47-P4789_2359495:48-nf] ) then assuredly itself gives the merits, not to merits is given. Consequently it goes before even faith, from which it is that all good works begin. \"For the just,\" as is written, \"shall live by faith.\"[fn-47-P4790_2359822:49-nf] But, moreover, grace not only assists the just, but also justifies the ungodly. And therefore even when it does aid the just and seems to be rendered to his merits, not even then does it cease to be grace, because that which it aids it did itself bestow. With a view therefore to this grace, which precedes all good merits of man, not only was Christ put to death by the ungodly, but \"died for the ungodly.\"[fn-47-P4791_2360249:50-nf] And ere that He died, He elected the Apostles, not of course then just, but to be justified: to whom He saith, \"I have chosen you out of the world.\" For to whom He said, \"Ye are not of the world,\" and then, lest they should account themselves never to have been of the world, presently added, \"But I have chosen you out of the world;\" assuredly that they should not be of the world was by His own election of them conferred upon them. Wherefore, if it had been through their own righteousness, not through His grace, that they were elected, they would not have been chosen out of the world, because they would already not be of the world if already they were just. And again, if the reason why they were elected was, that they were already just, they had already first chosen the Lord.

Why lean upon a blind guide, if you have eyes of your own? Why be clothed by one who is naked, if you have put on Christ? Why use the shield of another, when the apostle gives you armour of your own? It would be better for him to learn from you to acknowledge the resurrection of the flesh, than for you from him to deny it; because if Christians must needs deny it, it would be sufficient if they did so from their own knowledge, without any instruction from the ignorant multitude. He, therefore, will not be a Christian who shall deny this doctrine which is confessed by Christians; denying it, moreover, on grounds which are adopted by a man who is not a Christian. Take away, indeed, from the heretics the wisdom which they share with the heathen, and let them support their inquiries from the Scriptures alone: they will then be unable to keep their ground. For that which commends men's common sense is its very simplicity, and its participation in the same feelings, and its community of opinions; and it is deemed to be all the more trustworthy, inasmuch as its definitive statements are naked and open, and known to all.

If, they say, it be actually the selfsame substance which is recalled to life with all its form, and lineaments, and quality, then why not with all its other characteristics? Then the blind, and the lame, and the palsied, and whoever else may have passed away with any conspicuous mark, will return again with the same. What now is the fact, although you in the greatness of your conceit[fn-102-P10288_2877757:437-nf] thus disdain to accept from God so vast a grace? Does it not happen that, when you now admit the salvation of only the soul, you ascribe it to men at the cost of half their nature? What is the good of believing in the resurrection, unless your faith embraces the whole of it? If the flesh is to be repaired after its dissolution, much more will it be restored after some violent injury. Greater cases prescribe rules for lesser ones. Is not the amputation or the crushing of a limb the death of that limb? Now, if the death of the whole person is rescinded by its resurrection, what must we say of the death of a part of him? If we are changed for glory, how much more for integrity![fn-102-P10289_2878462:438-nf] Any loss sustained by our bodies is an accident to them, but their entirety is their natural property. In this condition we are born. Even if we become injured in the womb, this is loss suffered by what is already a human being. Natural condition\"[fn-102-P10290_2878755:439-nf] is prior to injury. As life is bestowed by God, so is it restored by Him. As we are when we receive it, so are we when we recover it. To nature, not to injury, are we restored; to our state by birth, not to our condition by accident, do we rise again. If God raises not men entire, He raises not the dead. For what dead man is entire, although he dies entire? Who is without hurt, that is without life? What body is uninjured, when it is dead, when it is cold, when it is ghastly, when it is stiff, when it is a corpse? When is a man more infirm, than when he is entirely infirm? When more palsied, than when quite motionless? Thus, for a dead man to be raised again, amounts to nothing short of his being restored to his entire condition,-lest he, forsooth, be still dead in that part in which he has not risen again. God is quite able to re-make what He once made. This power and this unstinted grace of His He has already sufficiently guaranteed in Christ; and has displayed Himself to us (in Him) not only as the restorer of the flesh, but as the repairer of its breaches. And so the apostle says: \"The dead shall be raised incorruptible\" (or unimpaired).[fn-102-P10291_2879930:440-nf] But how so, unless they become entire, who have wasted away either in the loss of their health, or in the long decrepitude of the grave? For when he propounds the two clauses, that \"this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality, \"[fn-102-P10292_2880220:441-nf] he does not repeat the same statement, but sets forth a distinction. For, by assigning immortality to the repeating of death, and incorruption to the repairing of the wasted body, he has fitted one to the raising and the other to the retrieval of the body. I suppose, moreover, that he promises to the Thessalonians the integrity of the whole substance of man.[fn-102-P10293_2880603:442-nf] So that for the great future there need be no fear of blemished or defective bodies. Integrity, whether the result of preservation or restoration, will be able to lose nothing more, after the time that it has given back to it whatever it had lost. Now, when you contend that the flesh will still have to undergo the same sufferings, if the same flesh be said to have to rise again, you rashly set up nature against her Lord, and impiously contrast her law against His grace; as if it were not permitted the Lord God both to change nature, and to preserve her, without subjection to a law. How is it, then, that we read, \"With men these things are impossible, but with God all things are possible; \"[fn-102-P10294_2881339:443-nf] and again, \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise? \"[fn-102-P10295_2881445:444-nf] Let me ask you, if you were to manumit your slave (seeing that the same flesh and soul will remain to him, which once were exposed to the whip, and the fetter, and the stripes), will it therefore be fit for him to undergo the same old sufferings? I trow not. He is instead thereof honoured with the grace of the white robe, and the favour of the gold ring, and the name and tribe as well as table of his patron. Give, then, the same prerogative to God, by virtue of such a change, of reforming our condition, not our nature, by taking away from it all sufferings, and surrounding it with safeguards of protection. Thus our flesh shall remain even after the resurrection-so far indeed susceptible of suffering, as it is the flesh, and the same flesh too; but at the same time impassible, inasmuch as it has been liberated by the Lord for the very end and purpose of being no longer capable of enduring suffering.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But some one will say, \"In what way is that called the old which was given by Moses four hundred and thirty years after; and that called the new which was given so many years before to Abraham?\" Let him who on this subject is disturbed, not litigiously but earnestly, first understand that when from its earlier time one is called \"old,\" and from its posterior time the other \"new,\" it is the revelation of them that is considered in their names, not their institution. Because the old testament was revealed through Moses, by whom the holy and just and good law was given, whereby should be brought about not the doing away but the knowledge of sin,-by which the proud might be convicted who were desirous of establishing their own righteousness, as if they had no need of divine help, and being made guilty of the letter, might flee to the Spirit of grace, not to be justified by their own righteousness, but by that of God-that is, by the righteousness which was given to them of God. For as the same apostle says, \"By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and by the prophets.\"[fn-54-P5471_2143467:53-nf] Because the law, by the very fact that in it no man is justified, affords a witness to the righteousness of God. For that in the law no man is justified before God is manifest, because \"the just by faith lives.\"[fn-54-P5472_2143702:54-nf] Thus, therefore, although the law does not justify the wicked when he is convicted of transgression, it sends to the God who justifieth, and thus affords a testimony to the righteousness of God. Moreover, the prophets offer testimony to God's righteousness by fore-announcing Christ, \"who is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-54-P5473_2144168:55-nf] But that law was kept hidden from the beginning, when nature itself convicted wicked men, who did to others what they would not have done to themselves. But the revelation of the new testament in Christ was made when He was manifested in the flesh, wherein appeared the righteousness of God -that is, the righteousness which is to men from God. For hence he says, \"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested.\"[fn-54-P5474_2144621:56-nf] This is the reason why the former is called the old testament, because it was revealed in the earlier time; and the latter the new, because it was revealed in the later time. In a word, it is because the old testament pertains to the old man, from which it is necessary that a man should make a beginning; but the new to the new man, by which a than ought to pass from his old state. Thus, in the former are earthly promises, in the latter heavenly promises; because this pertained to God's mercy, that no one should think that even earthly felicity of any kind whatever could be conferred on anybody, save from the Lord, who is the Creator of all things. But if God is worshipped for the sake of that earthly happiness, the worship is that of a slave, belonging to the children of the bondmaid; but if for the sake of God Himself, so that in the life eternal God may be all things in all, it is a free service belonging to the children of the freewoman, who is our mother eternal in the heavens-who first seemed, as it were, barren, when she had not any children manifest; but now we see what was prophesied concerning her: \"Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for there are many children of the desolate more than of her who has an husband,\"[fn-54-P5475_2145935:57-nf] -that is, more than of that Jerusalem, who in a certain manner is married in the bond of the law, and is in bondage with her children.

Far from it. For such things as these are evil deservings, while those gifts are good.

From this you may understand why I wrote the letter which has been referred to,[fn-58-P5832_2288732:148-nf] to Sixtus, presbyter of the Church at Rome, against the new Pelagian heretics, who say that the grace of God is bestowed according to our own merits, so that he who glories has to glory not in the Lord, but in himself,-that is to say, in man, not in the Lord. This, however, the apostle forbids in these words: \"Let no man glory in man;\"[fn-58-P5833_2289086:149-nf] while in another passage he says, \"He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5834_2289189:150-nf] But these heretics, under the idea that they are justified by their own selves, just as if God did not bestow on them this gift, but they themselves obtained it by themselves, glory of course in themselves, and not in the Lord. Now, the apostle says to such, \"Who maketh thee to differ from another?\"[fn-58-P5835_2289529:151-nf] and this he does on the ground that out of the mass of perdition which arose from Adam, none but God distinguishes a man to make him a vessel to honour, and not to dishonour.[fn-58-P5836_2289725:152-nf] Lest, however, the carnal man in his foolish pride should, on hearing the question, \"Who maketh thee to differ from another?\" either in thought or in word answer and say: My faith, or my prayer, or my righteousness makes me to differ from other men, the apostle at once adds these words to the question, and so meets all such notions, saying, \"What hast thou that thou didst not receive? now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou didst not receive it?\"[fn-58-P5837_2290220:153-nf] Now, they boast as if they did not receive their gifts by grace, who think that they are justified of their own selves, and who, on this account, glory in themselves, and not in the Lord.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-10","text":"When a house is being built which is to be made as strong as possible, the building takes place in fine weather and in calm, so that nothing may hinder the structure from acquiring the needed solidity. And thus it turns out so strong and stable that it is able to withstand the rush of the flood. and the dashing of the river, and all the agencies accompanying a storm which are apt to find out what is rotten in a building and to show what parts of it have been properly put together. And more particularly should that house which is capable of sheltering the speculations of truth, the house of reason, as it were, in promise or in letters, be built at a time when God can add His free co-operation to the projector of so noble a work, when the soul is quiet and in the enjoyment of that peace which passes all understanding, when she is turned away from all disturbance and not buffeted by any billows. This, it appears to me, was well understood by the servants of the prophetic spirit and the ministers of the Gospel message; they made themselves worthy to receive that peace which is in secret from Him who ever gives it to them that are worthy and who said,[fn-66-P6694_1177399:1-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you.\" And look if some similar lesson is not taught under the surface with regard to David and Solomon in the narrative about the temple. David, who fought the wars of the Lord and stood firm against many enemies, his own and those of Israel, desired to build a temple for God. But God, through Nathan, prevents him from doing so, and Nathan says to him,[fn-66-P6695_1177858:2-nf] \"Thou shalt not build me an house, because thou art a man of blood.\" But Solomon, on the other hand, saw God in a dream, and in a dream received wisdom, for the reality of the vision was kept for him who said, \"Behold a greater than Solomon is here.\" The time was one of the profoundest peace, so that it was possible for every man to rest under his own vine and his own fig-tree, and Solomon's very name was significant of the peace which was in his days, for Solomon means peaceful; and so he was at liberty to build the famous temple of God. About the time of Ezra, also, when \"truth conquers wine and the hostile king: and women,\"[fn-66-P6696_1178517:3-nf] the temple of God is restored again. All this is said by way of apology to you, reverend Ambrosius. It is at your sacred encouragement that I have made up my mind to build up in writing: the tower of the Gospel; and I have therefore sate down to count the cost,[fn-66-P6697_1178807:4-nf] if I have sufficient to finish it, lest I should be mocked by the beholders, because I laid the foundation but was not able to finish the work. The result of my counting, it is true, has been that I do not possess what is required to finish it; yet I have put my trust in God, who enriches us[fn-66-P6698_1179117:5-nf] with all wisdom and all knowledge. If we strive to keep His spiritual laws we believe that He does enrich us; He will supply what is necessary so that we shall get on with our building, and shall even come to the parapet of the structure. That parapet it is which keeps from falling those who go up on the house of the Word; for people only fall off those houses which have no parapet, so that the buildings themselves are to blame for their fall and for their death. We proceeded as far as the fifth volume in spite of the obstacles presented by the storm in Alexandria, and spoke what was given us to speak, for Jesus rebuked the winds and the waves of the sea. We emerged from the storm, we were brought out of Egypt, that God delivering us who led His people forth from there. Then, when the enemy assailed us with all bitterness by his new writings, so directly hostile to the Gospel, and stirred up against us all the winds of wickedness in Egypt, I felt that reason called me rather to stand fist for the conflict, and to save the higher part in me, lest evil counsels should succeed in directing the storm so as to overwhelm my soul, rather to do this than to finish my work at an unsuitable season, before my mind had recovered its calm. Indeed, the ready writers who usually attended me brought my work to a stand by failing to appear to take down my words. But now that the many fiery darts directed against me have lost their edge, for God extinguished them, and my soul has grown accustomed to the dispensation sent me for the sake of the heavenly word, and has learned from necessity to disregard the snares of my enemies, it is as if a great calm had settled on me, and Idefer no longer the continuation of this work. I pray that God will be with me, and will speak as a teacher in the porch of my soul, so that the building I have begun of the exposition of the Gospel of John may arrive at completion. May God hear my prayer and grant that the body of the whole work may now be brought together, and that no interruption may intervene which might prevent me from following the sequence of Scripture. And be assured that it is with great readiness that I now make this second beginning and enter on my sixth volume, because what I wrote before at Alexandria has not, I know not by what chance, been brought with me. I feared I might neglect this work, if I were not engaged on it at once, and therefore thought it better to make use of this present time and begin without delay the part which remains. I am not certain if the part formerly written will come to light, and would be very unwilling to waste time in waiting to see if it does. Enough of preamble, let us now attend to our text.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"So it is either the Father or the Son, and the day is not the same as the night; nor is the Father the same as the Son, in such a way that Both of them should be One, and One or the Other should be Both,-an opinion which the most conceited \"Monarchians\" maintain. He Himself, they say, made Himself a Son to Himself.[fn-105-P10510_2945276:103-nf] Now a Father makes a Son, and a Son makes a Father;[fn-105-P10511_2945359:104-nf] and they who thus become reciprocally related out of each other to each other cannot in any way by themselves simply become so related to themselves, that the Father can make Himself a Son to Himself, and the Son render Himself a Father to Himself. And the relations which God establishes, them does He also guard. A father must needs have a son, in order to be a father; so likewise a son, to be a son, must have a father. It is, however, one thing to have, and another thing to be. For instance, in order to be a husband, I must have a wife; I can never myself be my own wife. In like manner, in order to be a father, I have a son, for I never can be a son to myself; and in order to be a son, I have a father, it being impossible for me ever to be my own father. And it is these relations which make me (what I am), when I come to possess them: I shall then be a father, when I have a son; and a son, when I have a father. Now, if I am to be to myself any one of these relations, I no longer have what I am myself to be: neither a father, because I am to be my own father; nor a son, because I shall be my own son. Moreover, inasmuch as I ought to have one of these relations in order to be the other; so, if I am to be both together, I shall fail to be one while I possess not the other. For if I must be myself my son, who am also a father, I now cease to have a son, since I am my own son. But by reason of not having a son, since I am my own son, how can I be a father? For I ought to have a son, in order to be a father. Therefore I am not a son, because I have not a father, who makes a son. In like manner, if I am myself my father, who am also a son, I no longer have a father, but am myself my father. By not having a father, however, since I am my own father, how can I be a son? For I ought to have a father, in order to be a son. I cannot therefore be a father, because I have not a son, who makes a father. Now all this must be the device of the devil-this excluding and severing one from the other-since by including both together in one under pretence of the Monarchy, he causes neither to be held and acknowledged, so that He is not the Father, since indeed He has not the Son; neither is He the Son, since in like manner He has not the Father: for while He is the Father, He will not be the Son. In this way they hold the Monarchy, but they hold neither the Father nor the Son. Well, but \"with God nothing is impossible.\"[fn-105-P10512_2947866:105-nf] True enough; who can be ignorant of it? Who also can be unaware that \"the things which are impossible with men are possible with God? \"[fn-105-P10513_2948025:106-nf] The foolish things also of the world hath God chosen to confound the things which are wise.\"[fn-105-P10514_2948141:107-nf] We have read it all. Therefore, they argue, it was not difficult for God to make Himself both a Father and a Son, contrary to the condition of things among men. For a barren woman to have a child against nature was no difficulty with God; nor was it for a virgin to conceive. Of course nothing is \"too hard for the Lord.\"[fn-105-P10515_2948484:108-nf] But if we choose to apply this principle so extravagantly and harshly in our capricious imaginations, we may then make out God to have done anything we please, on the ground that it was not impossible for Him to do it. We must not, however, because He is able to do all things suppose that He has actually done what He has not done. But we must inquire whether He has really done it. God could, if He had liked, have furnished man with wings to fly with, just as He gave wings to kites. We must not, however, run to the conclusion that He did this because He was able to do it. He might also have extinguished Praxeas and all other heretics at once; it does not follow, however, that He did, simply because He was able. For it was necessary that there should be both kites and heretics; it was necessary also that the Father should be crucified.[fn-105-P10516_2949353:109-nf] In one sense there will be something difficult even for God-namely, that which He has not done--not because He could not, but because He would not, do it. For with God, to be willing is to be able, and to be unwilling is to be unable; all that He has willed, however, He has both been able to accomplish, and has displayed His ability. Since, therefore, if God had wished to make Himself a Son to Himself, He had it in His power to do so; and since, if He had it in His power, He effected His purpose, you will then make good your proof of His power and His will (to do even this) when you shall have proved to us that He actually did it.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But this very declaration of His they will hastily pervert into an argument of His singleness. \"I have,\" says He, \"stretched out the heaven alone.\" Undoubtedly alone as regards all other powers; and He thus gives a premonitory evidence against the conjectures of the heretics, who maintain that the world was constructed by various angels and powers, who also make the Creator Himself to have been either an angel or some subordinate agent sent to form external things, such as the constituent parts of the world, but who was at the same time ignorant of the divine purpose. If, now, it is in this sense that He stretches out the heavens alone, how is it that these heretics assume their position so perversely, as to render inadmissible the singleness of that Wisdom which says, \"When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him? \"[fn-106-P10657_2995058:223-nf] -even though the apostle asks, \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-106-P10658_2995185:224-nf] meaning, of course, to except that wisdom which was present with Him.[fn-106-P10659_2995275:225-nf] In Him, at any rate, and with Him, did (Wisdom) construct the universe, He not being ignorant of what she was making. \"Except Wisdom,\" however, is a phrase of the same sense exactly as \"except the Son,\" who is Christ, \"the Wisdom and Power of God,\"[fn-106-P10660_2995547:226-nf] according to the apostle, who only knows the mind of the Father. \"For who knoweth the things that be in God, except the Spirit which is in Him? \"[fn-106-P10661_2995714:227-nf] Not, observe, without Him. There was therefore One who caused God to be not alone, except \"alone\" from all other gods. But (if we are to follow the heretics), the Gospel itself will have to be rejected, because it tells us that all things were made by God through the Word, without whom nothing was made.[fn-106-P10662_2996040:228-nf] And if I am not mistaken, there is also another passage in which it is written: \"By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hosts of them by His Spirit.\"[fn-106-P10663_2996228:229-nf] Now this Word, the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, must be the very Son of God. So that, if (He did) all things by the Son, He must have stretched out the heavens by the Son, and so not have stretched them out alone, except in the sense in which He is \"alone\" (and apart) from all other gods. Accordingly He says, concerning the Son, immediately afterwards: \"Who else is it that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad, turning wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish, and confirming the words[fn-106-P10664_2996783:230-nf] of His Son? \"[fn-106-P10665_2996819:231-nf] -as, for instance, when He said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-106-P10666_2996986:232-nf] By thus attaching the Son to Himself, He becomes His own interpreter in what sense He stretched out the heavens alone, meaning alone with His Son, even as He is one with His Son. The utterance, therefore, will be in like manner the Son's, \"I have stretched out the heavens alone,\"[fn-106-P10667_2997289:233-nf] because by the Word were the heavens established.[fn-106-P10668_2997361:234-nf] Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when Wisdom was present in the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because He alone ministered to the Father's work. It must also be He who says, \"I am the First, and to all futurity I AM.\"[fn-106-P10669_2997707:235-nf] The Word, no doubt, was before all things. \"In the beginning was the Word; \"[fn-106-P10670_2997811:236-nf] and in that beginning He was sent forth[fn-106-P10671_2997869:237-nf] by the Father. The Father, however, has no beginning, as proceeding from none; nor can He be seen, since He was not begotten. He who has always been alone could never have had order or rank. Therefore, if they have determined that the Father and the Son must be regarded as one and the same, for the express purpose of vindicating the unity of God, that unity of His is preserved intact; for He is one, and yet He has a Son, who is equally with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures. Since they are unwilling to allow that the Son is a distinct Person, second from the Father, lest, being thus second, He should cause two Gods to be spoken of, we have shown above[fn-106-P10672_2998556:238-nf] that Two are actually described in Scripture as God and Lord. And to prevent their being offended at this fact, we give a reason why they are not said to be two Gods and two Lords, but that they are two as Father and Son; and this not by severance of their substance, but from the dispensation wherein we declare the Son to be undivided and inseparable from the Father,-distinct in degree, not in state. And although, when named apart, He is called God, He does not thereby constitute two Gods, but one; and that from the very circumstance that He is entitled to be called God, from His union with the Father.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But if you suppose that upon that one Peter only the whole church is built by God, what would you say about John the son of thunder or each one of the Apostles?

And also the saying, \"Upon this rock I will build My church\"?[fn-79-P7912_1681001:72-nf] Are the keys of the kingdom of heaven given by the Lord to Peter only, and will no other of the blessed receive them? But if this promise, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-79-P7913_1681219:73-nf] be common to the others, how shall not all the things previously spoken of, and the things which are subjoined as having been addressed to Peter, be common to them? For in this place these words seem to be addressed as to Peter only, \"Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,\"[fn-79-P7914_1681537:74-nf] etc; but in the Gospel of John the Saviour having given the Holy Spirit unto the disciples by breathing upon them said, \"Receive ye the Holy Spirit,\"[fn-79-P7915_1681707:75-nf] etc. Many then will say to the Saviour, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; \"but not all who say this will say it to Him, as not at all having learned it by the revelation of flesh and blood but by the Father in heaven Himself taking away the veil that lay upon their heart, in order that after this \"with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord\"[fn-79-P7916_1682105:76-nf] they may speak through the Spirit of God saying concerning Him, \"Lord Jesus,\" and to Him, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"[fn-79-P7917_1682266:77-nf] And if any one says this to Him, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto Him but through the Father in heaven, he will obtain the things that were spoken according to the letter of the Gospel to that Peter, but, as the spirit of the Gospel teaches, to every one who becomes such as that Peter was. For all bear the surname of \"rock\" who are the imitators of Christ, that is, of the spiritual rock which followed those who are being saved,[fn-79-P7918_1682725:78-nf] that they may drink from it the spiritual draught. But these bear the surname of the rock just as Christ does. But also as members of Christ deriving their surname from Him they are called Christians, and from the rock, Peters. And taking occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear the surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is Wisdom.[fn-79-P7919_1683128:79-nf] And so in regard to all His other names, you will apply them by way of surname to the saints; and to all such the saying of the Saviour might be spoken, \"Thou art Peter,\" etc., down to the words, \"prevail against it.\" But what is the \"it\"? Is it the rock upon which Christ builds the church, or is it the church? For the phrase is ambiguous. Or is it as if the rock and the church were one and the same? This I think to be true; for neither against the rock on which Christ builds the church, nor against the church will the gates of Hades prevail; just as the way of a serpent upon a rock, according to what is written in the Proverbs,[fn-79-P7920_1683784:80-nf] cannot be found. Now, if the gates of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a rock upon which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by Jesus upon the rock; for the rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing it, so that because of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the rock,[fn-79-P7921_1684260:81-nf] is incapable of admitting the gates of Hades which prevail against every man who is outside the rock and the church, but have no power against it.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Moreover in regard to the saying, \"Let him deny himself,\"[fn-80-P8053_1720808:171-nf] the following saying of Paul who denied himself seems appropriate, \"Yet I live, and yet no longer I but Christ liveth in me; \"[fn-80-P8054_1720957:172-nf] for the expression, \"I live, yet no longer I,\" was the voice of one denying himself, as of one who had laid aside his own life and taken on himself the Christ, in order that He might live in him as Righteousness, and as Wisdom, and as Sanctification, and as our Peace,[fn-80-P8055_1721246:173-nf] and as the Power of God, who worketh all things in him.

Seeing, then, that such is the end, when all enemies will be subdued to Christ, when death-the last enemy-shall be destroyed, and when the kingdom shall be delivered up by Christ (to whom all things are subject) to God the Father; let us, I say, from such an end as this, contemplate the beginnings of things. For the end is always like the beginning: and, therefore, as there is one end to all things, so ought we to understand that there was one beginning; and as there is one end to many things, so there spring from one beginning many differences and varieties, which again, through the goodness of God, and by subjection to Christ, and through the unity of the Holy Spirit, are recalled to one end, which is like unto the beginning: all those, viz., who, bending the knee at the name of Jesus, make known by so doing their subjection to Him: and these are they who are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth: by which three classes the whole universe of things is pointed out, those, viz., who from that one beginning were arranged, each according to the diversity of his conduct, among the different orders, in accordance with their desert; for there was no goodness in them by essential being, as in God and His Christ, and in the Holy Spirit. For in the Trinity alone, which is the author of all things, does goodness exist in virtue of essential being; while others possess it as an accidental and perishable quality, and only then enjoy blessedness, when they participate in holiness and wisdom, and in divinity itself. But if they neglect and despise such participation, then is each one, by fault of his own slothfulness, made, one more rapidly, another more slowly, one in a greater, another in a less degree, the cause of his own downfall. And since, as we have remarked, the lapse by which an individual falls away from his position is characterized by great diversity, according to the movements of the mind and will, one man falling with greater ease, another with more difficulty, into a lower condition; in this is to be seen the just judgment of the providence of God, that it should happen to every one according to the diversity of his conduct, in proportion to the desert of his declension and defection. Certain of those, indeed, who remained in that beginning which we have described as resembling the end which is to come, obtained, in the ordering and arrangement of the world, the rank of angels; others that of influences, others of principalities, others of powers, that they may exercise power over those who need to have power upon their head. Others, again, received the rank of thrones, having the office of judging or ruling those who require this; others dominion, doubtless, over slaves; all of which are conferred by Divine Providence in just and impartial judgment according to their merits, and to the progress which they had made in the participation and imitation of God. But those who have been removed from their primal state of blessedness have not been removed irrecoverably, but have been placed under the rule of those holy and blessed orders which we have described; and by availing themselves of the aid of these, and being remoulded by salutary principles and discipline, they may recover themselves, and be restored to their condition of happiness. From all which I am of opinion, so far as I can see, that this order of the human race has been appointed in order that in the future world, or in ages to come, when there shall be the new heavens and new earth, spoken of by Isaiah, it may be restored to that unity promised by the Lord Jesus in His prayer to God the Father on behalf of His disciples: \"I do not pray for these alone, but for all who shall believe on Me through their word: that they all. may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us; \"[fn-64-P6406_1206122:108-nf] and again, when He says: \"That they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one.\"[fn-64-P6407_1206282:109-nf] And this is further confirmed by the language of the Apostle Paul: \"Until we all come in the unity of the faith to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\"[fn-64-P6408_1206495:110-nf] And in keeping with this is the declaration of the same apostle, when he exhorts us, who even in the present life are placed in the Church, in which is the form of that kingdom which is to come, to this same similitude of unity: \"That ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.\"[fn-64-P6409_1206906:111-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_27_sermon_x_lx_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5.

And why He does not teach all men the apostle explained, as far as he judged that it was to be explained, because, \"willing to show His wrath, and to exhibit His power, He endured with much patience the vessels of wrath which were perfected for destruction; and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for glory.\"[fn-67-P6758_2576519:62-nf] Hence it is that the \"word of the cross is foolishness to them that perish; but unto them that are saved it is the power of God.\"[fn-67-P6759_2576667:63-nf] God teaches all such to come to Christ, for He wills alI such to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Why, then, said the Son to the mother, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come?\" Our Lord Jesus Christ was both God and man. According as He was God, He had not a mother; according as He was man, He had. She was the mother, then, of His flesh, of His humanity, of the weakness which for our sakes He took upon Him. But the miracle which He was about to do, He was about to do according to His divine nature, not according to His weakness; according to that wherein He was God not according to that wherein He was born weak. But the weakness of God is stronger than men.[fn-5-P581_270807:9-nf] His mother then demanded a miracle of Him; but He, about to perform divine works, so far did not recognize a human womb; saying in effect, \"That in me which works a miracle was not born of thee, thou gavest not birth to my divine nature; but because my weakness was born of thee, I will recognize thee at the time when that same weakness shall hang upon the cross.\" This, indeed, is the meaning of \"Mine hour is not yet come.\" For then it was that He recognized, who, in truth, always did know. He knew His mother in predestination, even before He was born of her; even before, as God, He created her of whom, as man, He was to be created, He knew her as His mother: but at a certain hour in a mystery He did not recognize her; and at a certain hour which had not yet come, again in a mystery, He does recognize her. For then did He recognize her, when that to which she gave birth was a-dying. That by which Mary was made did not die, but that which was made of Mary; not the eternity of the divine nature, but the weakness of the flesh, was dying. He made that answer therefore, making a distinction in the faith of believers, between the who; and the how, He came. For whiIe He was God and the Lord of heaven and earth, He came by a mother who was a woman. In that He was Lord of the world, Lord of heaven and earth, He was, of course, the Lord of Mary also; but in that wherein it is said, \"Made of a woman, made under the law,\" He was Mary's son. The same both the Lord of Mary and the son of Mary; the same both the Creator of Mary and created from Mary. Marvel not that He was both son and Lord. For just as He is called the son of Mary, so likewise is He called the son of David; and son of David because son of Mary. Hear the apostle openly declaring, \"Who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-5-P582_272647:10-nf] Hear Him also declared the Lord of David; let David himself declare this: \"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-5-P583_272795:11-nf] And this passage Jesus Himself brought forward to the Jews, and refuted them from it.[fn-5-P584_272897:12-nf] How then was He both David's son and David's Lord? David's son according to the flesh, David's Lord according to His divinity; so also Mary's son after the flesh, and Mary's Lord after His majesty. Now as she was not the mother of His divine nature, whilst it was by His divinity the miracle she asked for would be wrought, therefore He answered her, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\" But think not that I deny thee to be my mother: \"Mine hour is not yet come;\" for in that hour I will acknowledge thee, when the weakness of which thou art the mother comes to hang on the cross. Let us prove the truth of this. When the Lord suffered, the same evangelist tells us, who knew the mother of the Lord, and who has given us to know about her in this marriage feast,-the same, I say, tells us, \"There was there near the cross the mother of Jesus; and Jesus saith to His mother, Woman, behold thy son! and to the disciple, Behold thy mother!\"[fn-5-P585_273853:13-nf] He commends His mother to the care of the disciple; commends His mother, as about to die before her, and to rise again before her death. The man commends her a human being to man's care. This humanity had Mary given birth to. That hour had now come, the hour of which He had then said, \"Mine hour is not yet come.\"","title":"Tractate VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-04","text":"12. But if the proofs which we have adduced do not appear full enough, and the similitude of the apostle seem wanting in applicability,[fn-69-P6912_1473687:112-nf] let us add the voice of prophetic authority, and see what the prophets declare regarding those who at first, indeed, leading a righteous life, have deserved to receive numerous proofs of the goodness of God, but afterwards, as being human beings, have fallen astray, with whom the prophet, making himself also one, says:\"Why, O Lord, hast Thou made us to err from Thy way? and hardened our heart, that we should not fear Thy name? Return, for Thy servants' sake, for the tribes of Thine inheritance, that we also for a little may obtain some inheritance from Thy holy hill.\"[fn-69-P6913_1474339:113-nf] Jeremiah also employs similar language: \"O Lord, Thou hast deceived us, and we were deceived; Thou hast held (us), and Thou hast prevailed.\"[fn-69-P6914_1474559:114-nf] The expression, then, \"Why, O Lord, hast Thou hardened our heart, that we should not fear Thy name? \"used by those who prayed for mercy, is to be taken in a figurative, moral acceptation,[fn-69-P6915_1474766:115-nf] as if one were to say, \"Why hast Thou spared us so long, and didst not requite us when we sinned, but didst abandon us, that so our wickedness might increase, and our liberty of sinning be extended when punishment ceased? \"In like manner, unless a horse continually feel the spur[fn-69-P6916_1475086:116-nf] of his rider, and have his mouth abraded by a bit,[fn-69-P6917_1475161:117-nf] he becomes hardened. And a boy also, unless constantly disciplined by chastisement, will grow up to be an insolent youth, and one ready to fall headlong into vice. God accordingly abandons and neglects those whom He has judged undeserving of chastisement: \"For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.\"[fn-69-P6918_1475526:118-nf] From which we are to suppose that those are to be received into the rank and affection of sons, who have deserved to be scourged and chastened by the Lord, in order that they also, through endurance of trials and tribulations, may be able to say, \"Who shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus? shall tribulation, or anguish, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? \"[fn-69-P6919_1475941:119-nf] For by all these is each one's resolution manifested and displayed, and the firmness of his perseverance made known, not so much to God, who knows all things before they happen, as to the rational and heavenly virtues,[fn-69-P6920_1476183:120-nf] who have obtained a part in the work of procuring human salvation, as being a sort of assistants and ministers to God. Those, on the other hand, who do not yet offer themselves to God with such constancy and affection, and are not ready to come into His service, and to prepare their souls for trial, are said to be abandoned by God, i.e., not to be instructed, inasmuch as they are not prepared for instruction, their training or care being undoubtedly postponed to a later time. These certainly do not know what they will obtain from God, unless they first entertain the desire of being bene-fired; and this finally will be the case, if a man come first to a knowledge of himself, and feel what are his defects, and understand from whom he either ought or can seek the supply of his deficiencies. For he who does not know beforehand of his weakness or his sickness, cannot seek a physician; or at least, after recovering his health, that man will not be grateful to his physician who did not first recognise the dangerous nature of his ailment. And so, unless a man has first ascertained the defects of his life, and the evil nature of his sins, and made this known by confession from his own lips, he cannot be cleansed or acquitted, lest he should be ignorant that what he possesses has been bestowed on him by favour, but should consider as his own property what flows from the divine liberality, which idea undoubtedly generates arrogance of mind and pride, and finally becomes the cause of the individual's ruin. And this, we must believe, was the case with the devil, who viewed as his own, and not as given him by God, the primacy[fn-69-P6921_1477872:121-nf] which he held at the time when he was unstained;[fn-69-P6922_1477938:122-nf] and thus was fulfilled in him the declaration, that \"every one who exalteth himself shall be abased.\"[fn-69-P6923_1478060:123-nf] From which it appears to me that the divine mysteries were concealed from the wise and prudent, according to the statement of Scripture, that \"no flesh should glory before God,\"[fn-69-P6924_1478261:124-nf] and revealed to children-to those, namely, who, after they have become infants and little children, i.e., have returned to the humility and simplicity of children, then make progress; and on arriving at perfection, remember that they have obtained their state of happiness, not by their own merits, but by the grace and compassion of God.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-04","text":"12.

Why hast Thou hardened our heart, so as not to fear Thy name? Return for Thy servants' sake, for the tribes of Thine inheritance, that we may inherit a shall portion of Thy holy mountain.\"[fn-69-P6928_1479180:127-nf] And in Jeremiah: \"Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I was deceived; Thou wert strong, and Thou didst prevail.\"[fn-69-P6929_1479319:128-nf] For the expression, \"Why hast Thou hardened our hear, so as not to fear Thy name? \"uttered by those who are begging to receive mercy, is in its nature as follows: \"Why hast Thou spared us so long, not visiting us because of our sins, but deserting us, until our transgressions come to a height? \"Now He leaves the greater part of men unpunished, both in order that the habits of each one may be examined, so far as it depends upon ourselves, and that the virtuous may be made manifest in consequence of the test applied; while the others, not escaping notice from God-for He knows all things before they exist-but from the rational creation and themselves, may afterwards obtain the means of cure, seeing they would not have known the benefit had they not condemned themselves. It is of advantage to each one, that he perceive his own peculiar nature[fn-69-P6930_1480189:129-nf] and the grace of God. For he who does not perceive his own weakness and the divine favour, although he receive a benefit, yet, not having made trial of himself, nor having condemned himself, will imagine that the benefit conferred upon him by the grace of Heaven is his own doing. And this imagination, producing also vanity,[fn-69-P6931_1480533:130-nf] will be the cause of a downfall: which, we conceive, was the case with the devil, who attributed to himself the priority which he possessed when in a state of sinlessness.[fn-69-P6932_1480722:131-nf] \"For every one that exalteth himself shall be abased,\" and \"every one that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\"[fn-69-P6933_1480848:132-nf] And observe, that for this reason divine things have been concealed from the wise and prudent, in order, as says the apostle, that \"no flesh should glory in the presence of God; \"[fn-69-P6934_1481053:133-nf] and they have been revealed to babes, to those who after childhood have come to better things, and who remember that it is not so much from their own effort, as by the unspeakable goodness (of God), that they have reached the greatest possible extent of blessedness.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-04","text":"2. Now, of these opinions, let us first discuss that which is maintained by some, that there is in us a good and heavenly soul, and another earthly and inferior; and that the better soul is implanted within us from heaven, such as was that which, while Jacob was still in the womb, gave him the prize of victory in supplanting his brother Esau, and which in the case of Jeremiah was sanctified from his birth, and in that of John was filled by the Holy Spirit from the womb. Now, that which they term the inferior soul is produced, they allege, along with the body itself out of the seed of the body, whence they say it cannot live or subsist beyond the body, on which account also they say it is frequently termed flesh. For the expression, \"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit,\"[fn-72-P7216_1606531:349-nf] they take to be applicable not to the flesh, but to this soul, which is properly the soul of the flesh. From these words, moreover, they endeavour notwithstanding to make good the declaration in Leviticus: \"The life of all flesh is the blood thereof.\"[fn-72-P7217_1606802:350-nf] For, from the circumstance that it is the diffusion of the blood throughout the whole flesh which produces life in the flesh, they assert that this soul, which is said to be the life of all flesh, is contained in the blood. This statement, moreover, that the flesh struggles against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and the further statement, that \"the life of all flesh is the blood thereof,\" is, according to these writers, simply calling the wisdom of the flesh by another name, because it is a kind of material spirit, which is not subject to the law of God, nor can be so, because it has earthly wishes and bodily desires. And it is with respect to this that they think the apostle uttered the words: \"I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.\"[fn-72-P7218_1607687:351-nf] And if one were to object to them that these words were spoken of the nature of the body, which indeed, agreeably to the peculiarity of its nature, is dead, but is said to have sensibility, or wisdom[fn-72-P7219_1607908:352-nf] which is hostile to God, or which struggles against the spirit; or if one were to say that, in a certain degree, the flesh itself was possessed of a voice, which should cry out against the endurance of hunger, or thirst, or cold, or of any discomfort arising either from abundance or poverty,-they would endeavour to weaken and impair the force of such (arguments), by showing that there were many other mental perturbations[fn-72-P7220_1608363:353-nf] which derive their origin in no respect from the flesh, and yet against which the spirit struggles, such as ambition, avarice, emulation, envy, pride, and others like these; and seeing that with these the human mind or spirit wages a kind of contest, they lay down as the cause of all these evils, nothing else than this corporal soul, as it were, of which we have spoken above, and which is generated from the seed by a process of traducianism. They are accustomed also to adduce, in support of their assertion, the declaration of the apostle, \"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, poisonings,[fn-72-P7221_1609056:354-nf] hatred, contentions, emulations, wrath, quarrelling, dissensions, heresies, sects, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and the like; \"[fn-72-P7222_1609249:355-nf] asserting that all these do not derive their origin from the habits or pleasures of the flesh, so that all such movements are to be regarded as inherent in that substance which has not a soul, i.e., the fresh. The declaration, moreover, \"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men among you according to the flesh are called,\"[fn-72-P7223_1609617:356-nf] would seem to require to be understood as if there were one kind of wisdom, carnal and material, and another according to the spirit, the former of which cannot indeed be called wisdom, unless there be a soul of the flesh, which is wise in respect of what is called carnal wisdom. And in addition to these passages they adduce the following: \"Since the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, so that we cannot do the things that we would.\"[fn-72-P7224_1610107:357-nf] What are these things now respecting which he says, \"that we cannot do the things that we would? \"It is certain, they reply, that the spirit cannot be intended; for the will of the spirit suffers no hindrance. But neither can the flesh be meant, because if it has not a soul of its own, neither can it assuredly possess a will. It remains, then, that the will of this soul be intended which is capable of having a Will of its own, and which certainly is opposed to the will of the spirit. And if this be the case, it is established that the will of the soul is something intermediate between the flesh add the spirit, undoubtedly obeying and serving that one of the two which it has elected to obey. And if it yield itself up to the pleasures of the flesh, it renders men carnal; but when it unites itself with the spirit, it produces men of the Spirit, and who on that account are termed spiritual. And this seems to be the meaning of the apostle in the words, \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.\"[fn-72-P7225_1611138:358-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":68,"source_paragraph":"208","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But what more shall I say?

The Steward brought me into the King's treasury and showed me there many precious things;\nand when I saw them my mind was captivated with the great treasury. And as I looked upon it, it\ndazzled my eyes, and took captive my thoughts, and caused my reflections to wander in many ways.\nWhosoever receives thereof, is himself enriched, and enriches (others). It lies open and unguarded\nbefore all that seek it; and though many take from it there is no deficiency; and when they give of\nthat which they have received, their own portion is greatly multiplied. They that receive freely let\nthem give freely[fn-44-P4434_1479193:18-nf] as they have received.\nFor (this treasure) cannot be sold for a price, because there is nothing equivalent to it. Moreover\nthe treasure fails not; and they that receive it are not satiated. They drink, and are still eager;\nthey eat, and are hungry. Whosoever is not thirsty, finds not ought to drink; whoever is not hungry,\nfinds nothing to eat. The hunger for it satisfies many, and from the thirst for it flow forth\nwater-springs. For the man who draws nigh to the fear of God is like the man who in his thirst draws\nnear to the water-spring and drinks and is satisfied, and the fountain is not a whit diminished. And\nthe land that needs to drink in water, drinks of the fountain, but its waters fail not. And when the\nland drinks, it needs again to drink, and the spring is not lessened by its flowing. So is the\nknowledge of God. Though all men should receive of it, yet there would come no lack in it, nor can it\nhe limited by the sons of flesh. He that takes from it, cannot take away all; and when he gives, he\nlacks nothing. When thou takest fire with a candle from a flame, though thou kindle many candles at\nit, yet the flame does not diminish when thou takest from it, nor does the candle fail, when it\nkindles many. One man cannot receive all the King's treasure, nor when a thirsty man drinks of the\nfountain, do its waters fill. When a man stands on a lofty mountain, his eye does not (equally)\ncomprehend the near and the distant; nor, when he stands and counts the stars of heaven, can he set\nlimits to the hosts of the heavens. So when he draws nigh unto the fear of God, he cannot attain to\nthe whole of it; and when he receives much that is precious, it does not seem to be diminished; and\nwhen he gives of that which he has received, it is not exhausted, nor has it come to an end for him.\nAnd remember, my beloved, what I wrote to thee, in the first discourse, about faith, that whoever has\nfreely received ought to give freely as he has received, as our Lord said:-Freely ye have\nreceived, freely give.[fn-44-P4435_1481235:19-nf] For whosoever\nkeeps back part of anything he has received,[fn-44-P4436_1481311:20-nf] even that which he has obtained shall be taken\naway from him.

For one is adorned with flowers of knowledge, another is more strongly fortified with methods of discretion, another is established in the dignity of patience, another excels inthe virtue of humility, another in that of continence, another is decked with the grace of simplicity. This one excels all others in magnanimity, that one in pity, another in vigils, another in silence, another in earnestness of work. And therefore the monk who desires to gather spiritual honey, ought like a most careful bee, to suck out virtue from those who specially possess it, and should diligently store it up in the vessel of his own breast: nor should he investigate what any one is lacking in, but only regard and gather whatever virtue he has. For if we want to gain all virtues from some one person, we shall with great difficulty or perhaps never at all find suitable examples for us to imitate. For though we do not as yet see that even Christ is made \"all things in all,\" as the Apostle says;[fn-24-P2464_1032861:6-nf] still in this way we can find Him bit by bit in all. For it is said of Him, \"Who was made of God to you wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\"[fn-24-P2465_1033044:7-nf] While then in one there is found wisdom, in another righteousness, in another sanctification, in another kindness, in another chastity, in another humility, in another patience, Christ is at the present time divided, member by member, among all of the saints. But when all come together into the unity of the faith and virtue, He is formed into the \"perfect man,\"[fn-24-P2466_1033425:8-nf] completing the fulness of His body, in the joints and properties of all His members. Until then that time arrives when God will be \"all in all,\" for the present God can in the way of which we have spoken be \"in all,\" through particular virtues, although He is not yet \"all in all\" through the fulness of them. For although our religion has but one end and aim, yet there are different ways by which we approach God, as will be more fully shown in the Conferences of the Elders.[fn-24-P2467_1033919:9-nf] And so we must seek a model of discretion and continence more particularly from those from whom we see that those virtues flow forth more abundantly through the grace of the Holy Spirit; not that any one can alone acquire those things which are divided among many, but in order that in those good qualities of which we are capable we may advance towards the imitation of those who especially have acquired them.","title":"Book V.Of the Spirit of Gluttony.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_133_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. \"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you through His name.\"[fn-40-P4073_2237016:16-nf] Therefore, \"little children,\"[fn-40-P4074_2237066:17-nf] because in forgiveness of sins ye have your birth.

Let us be ashamed, who though we have no preaching to occupy us, live in idleness. \"And he disputed in the synagogue every sabbath day, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks\" (v. 4): but \"when they opposed and blasphemed\" he withdrew, by this expecting to draw them more. For wherefore having left that house did he come to live hard by the synagogue? was it not for this? For it was not that he saw any danger here. But therefore it is that Paul having testified to them-not teaches now, but testifies- \"having shaken his garments,\" to terrify them not by word only but by action, \"said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads\" (v. 6): he speaks the more vehemently as having already persuaded many. \"I,\" says he, \"am clean.\" Then we also are accountable for the blood of those entrusted to us, if we neglect them. \"From this time forth I will go to the Gentiles.\" So that also when he says, \"Henceforth let no man trouble me\" (Gal. vi. 17), he says it to terrify. For not so much did the punishment terrify, as this stung them. \"And having removed thence he came into the house of one named Justus, that worshipped God, whose house was contiguous to the synagogue\" (v. 7), and there abode, by this wishing to persuade them that he was in earnest (proj ta eqnh hpeigeto) to go to the Gentiles. Accordingly, mark immediately the ruler of the synagogue converted, and many others, when he had done this. \"Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord, with his whole house: and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.\"-(v. 8.) \"With his whole house:\"[fn-15-P1510_1453549:9-nf] observe the converts in those times doing this with their entire household.

This was enough to rouse him. Not that he was reproved[fn-15-P1513_1455626:12-nf] as fearing; but that he should not suffer aught; \"I am with thee, and none shall set upon thee to hurt thee.\" (v. 9, 10.) For He did not always permit them to suffer evil, that they might not become too weak. For nothing so grieved Paul, as men's unbelief and setting themselves (against the Truth): this was worse than the dangers. Therefore it is that (Christ) appears to him now. \"And he continued a year and six months,\" etc. (v. 11.) After the year and six months, they set upon him. \"And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia,\" etc. (v. 12, 13), because they had no longer the use of their own laws.[fn-15-P1514_1457028:13-nf] (c) And observe how prudent he is: for he does not say straightway, I care not, but, \"If,\" says he, \"it were a matter of wrong-doing or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you; but if it be a question of doctrine and words and of your law, see ye to it, for I do not choose to be a judge of such matters.\" (v. 14, 15.) (g) He taught[fn-15-P1515_1457583:14-nf] them that not such are the matters which crave a judicial sentence, but they do all things out of order. And he does not say, It is not my duty, but, \"I do not choose,\" that they may not trouble him again. Thus Pilate said in the case of Christ, \"Take ye Him, and judge him according to your law.\" (John xviii. 31.) But they were just like men drunken and mad. (d) \"And he drave them from the judgment-seat\" (v. 16)-he effectually closed the tribunal against them. \"Then all\" (the Jews) \"having seized Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.\" (v. 17). (a) This thing, of all others, set them on (to this violence)-their persuasion that the governor would not even let himself down (to notice it). (e) It was a splendid victory. O the shame they were put to! (b) For it is one thing to have come off victorious from a controversy, and another for those to learn that he cared nothing for the affair. (f) \"And Gallio cared for none of these things:\" and yet the whole was meant as an insult to him! But, forsooth, as if they had received authority (they did this).

For when we leave off believing, and protect ourselves by mere strength of argument, and destroy the claim which the Spirit has upon our faith by questionings, and then our argument is not strong enough for the importance of the subject (and this must necessarily be the case, since it is put in motion by an organ of so little power as is our mind), what is the result?

For those, who are affected by this laziness, and do not like to support themselves by the labour of their own hands, as the Apostle continually did and charged us to do, are wont to make use of certain Scripture proofs by which they try to cloak their idleness, saying that it is written, \"Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that which remains to life eternal;\"[fn-31-P3141_1211907:29-nf] and \"My meat is to do the will of my Father.\"[fn-31-P3142_1211974:30-nf] But these proofs are (as it were) rags, from the solid piece of the gospel, which are adopted for this purpose, viz., to cover the disgrace of our idleness and shame rather than to keep us warm, and adorn us with that costly and splendid garment of virtue which that wise woman in the Proverbs, who was clothed with strength and beauty, is said to have made either for herself or for her husband; of which presently it is said: \"Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she rejoices in the latter days.\"[fn-31-P3143_1212501:31-nf] Of this evil of idleness Solomon thus makes mention again: \"The ways of the idlers are strown with thorns;\"[fn-31-P3144_1212630:32-nf] i.e., with these and similar faults, which the Apostle above declared to spring from idleness.

Just as though their party gained the power of generation in virtue of what constitutes its division, and not from what causes its union with the Church. For it is severed from the bond of peace and charity, but it is joined in one baptism. And so there is one Church which alone is called Catholic; and whenever it has anything of its own in these communions of different bodies which are separate from itself, it is most certainly in virtue of this which is its own in each of them that it, not they, has the power of generation. For neither is it their separation that generates, but what they have retained of the essence of the Church; and if they were to go on to abandon this, they would lose the power of generation. The generation, then, in each case proceeds from the Church, whose sacraments are retained, from which any such birth can alone in any case proceed,-although not all who receive its birth belong to its unity, which shall save those who persevere even to the end. Nor is it those only that do not belong to it who are openly guilty of the manifest sacrilege of schism, but also those who, being outwardly joined to its unity, are yet separated by a life of sin. For the Church had herself given birth to Simon Magus through the sacrament of baptism; and yet it was declared to him that he had no part in the inheritance of Christ.[fn-30-P3090_1811574:28-nf] Did he lack anything in respect of baptism, of the gospel, of the sacraments? But in that he wanted charity, he was born in vain; and perhaps it had been well for him that he had never been born at all. Was anything wanting to their birth to whom the apostle says, \"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat, even as babes in Christ\"? Yet he recalls them from the sacrilege of schism, into which they were rushing, because they were carnal: \"I have fed you,\" he says, \"with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?\"[fn-30-P3091_1812362:29-nf] For of these he says above: \"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment. For it hath been declared unto, me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chlöe, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.

Therefore she herself bears them in her own womb and in the womb of her handmaids, by virtue of the same sacraments, as though by virtue of the seed of her husband. For it is not without meaning that the apostle says that all these things were done by way of figure.[fn-30-P3093_1813472:31-nf] But those who are too proud, and are not joined to their lawful mother, are like Ishmael, of whom it is said, \"Cast out this bond-woman and her Son: for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.\"[fn-30-P3094_1813764:32-nf] But those who peacefully love the lawful wife of their father, whose sons they are by lawful descent, are like the sons of Jacob, born indeed of handmaids, but yet receiving the same inheritance.[fn-30-P3095_1813979:33-nf] But those who are born within the family, of the womb of the mother herself, and then neglect the grace they have received, are like Isaac's son Esau, who was rejected, God Himself bearing witness to it, and saying, \"I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau;\"[fn-30-P3096_1814248:34-nf] and that though they were twin-brethren, the offspring of the same womb.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"105","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But since Celsus has declared it to be a saying of many Christians, that \"the wisdom of this life is a bad thing, but that foolishness is good,\" we have to answer that he slanders the Gospel, not giving the words as they actually occur in the writings of Paul, where they run as follow: \"If any one among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.\"[fn-77-P7712_1803306:32-nf] The apostle, therefore, does not say simply that \"wisdom is foolishness with God,\" but \"the wisdom of this world.\" And again, not, \"If any one among you seemeth to be wise, let him become a fool universally; \"but, \"let him become a fool in this world, that he may become wise.\" We term, then, \"the wisdom of this world,\" every false system of philosophy, which, according to the Scriptures, is brought to nought; and we call foolishness good, not without restriction, but when a man becomes foolish as to this world.

Moreover, that it is in agreement with the spirit of Christianity, of much more importance to give our assent to doctrines upon grounds of reason and wisdom than on that of faith merely, and that it was only in certain circumstances that the latter course was desired by Christianity, in order not to leave men altogether without help, is shown by that genuine disciple of Jesus, Paul, when he says: \"For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\"[fn-77-P7714_1804800:34-nf] Now by these words it is clearly shown that it is by the wisdom of God that God ought to be known.

Nor is it material, when we are considering the question of the genuineness and holiness of the sacrament, \"what the recipient of the sacrament believes, and with what faith he is imbued.\" It is of the very highest consequence as regards the entrance into salvation, but is wholly immaterial as regards the question of the sacrament. For it is quite possible that a man may be possessed of the genuine sacrament and a corrupted faith, as it is possible that he may hold the words of the creed in their integrity, and yet entertain an erroneous belief about the Trinity, or the resurrection, or any other point. For it is no slight matter, even within the Catholic Church itself, to hold a faith entirely consistent with the truth about even God Himself, to say nothing of any of His creatures. Is it then to be maintained, that if any one who has been baptized within the Catholic Church itself should afterwards, in the course of reading, or by listening to instruction, or by quiet argument, find out, through God's own revelation, that he had before believed otherwise than he ought, it is requisite that he should therefore be baptized afresh? But what carnal and natural man is there who does not stray through the vain conceits[fn-33-P3343_1922344:26-nf] of his own heart, and picture God's nature to himself to be such as he has imagined out of his carnal sense, and differ from the true conception of God as far as vanity from truth? Most truly, indeed, speaks the apostle, filled with the light of truth: \"The natural man,\" says he, \"receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.\"[fn-33-P3344_1922692:27-nf] And yet herein he was speaking of men whom he himself shows to have been baptized. For he says to them, \"Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\"[fn-33-P3345_1922886:28-nf] These men had therefore the sacrament of baptism; and yet, inasmuch as their wisdom was of the flesh, what could they believe about God otherwise than according to the perception of their flesh, according to which \"the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God?\" To such he says: \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meal: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.\"[fn-33-P3346_1923438:29-nf] For such are carried about with every wind of doctrine, of which kind he says, \"That we be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.\"[fn-33-P3347_1923634:30-nf] It is then true that, if these men shall have advanced even to the spiritual age of the inner man, and in the integrity of understanding shall have learned how far different from the requirements of the truth has been the belief which they have been led by the fallacious character of their conceits to entertain of God, they are therefore to be baptized again? For, on this principle, it would be possible for a Catholic catechumen to light upon the writings of some heretic, and, not having the knowledge requisite for discerning truth from error, he might entertain some belief contrary to the Catholic faith, yet not condemned by the words of the creed, just as, under color of the same words, innumerable heretical errors have sprung up. Supposing, then, that the catechumen was under the impression that he was studying the work of some great and learned Catholic, and was baptized with that belief in the Catholic Church, and by subsequent research should discover what he ought to believe, so that, embracing the Catholic faith, he should reject his former error, ought he, on confessing this, to be baptized again? Or supposing that, before learning and confessing this for himself, he should be found to entertain such an opinion, and should be taught what he ought to reject and what he should believe, and it were to become clear that he had held this false belief when he was baptized, ought he therefore to be baptized again? Why should we maintain the contrary? Because the sanctity of the sacrament, consecrated in the words of the gospel, remains upon him in, its integrity, just as he received it from the hands of the minister, although he, being firmly rooted in the vanity of his carnal mind entertained a belief other than was right at the time when he was baptized. Wherefore it is manifest that it is possible that, with defective faith, the sacrament of baptism may yet remain without defect in any man; and therefore all that is said about the diversity of the several heretics is beside the question. For in each person that is to be corrected which is found to be amiss by the man who undertakes his correction. That is to be made whole which is unsound; that is to be given which is wanting, and, above all, the peace of Christian charity, without which the rest is profitless.

Now, let him who is of this opinion understand that the Gospel, as censuring wicked men, says of them that they are wise not in things which relate to the understanding, and which are unseen and eternal; but that in busying themselves about things of sense alone, and regarding these as all-important, they are wise men of the world: for as there are in existence a multitude of opinions, some of them espousing the cause of matter and bodies,[fn-87-P8772_2231215:151-nf] and asserting that everything is corporeal which has a substantial existence,[fn-87-P8773_2231344:152-nf] and that besides these nothing else exists, whether it be called invisible or incorporeal, it says also that these constitute the wisdom of the world, which perishes and fades away, and belongs only to this age, while those opinions which raise the soul from things here to the blessedness which is with God, and to His kingdom, and which teach men to despise all sensible and visible things as existing only for a season, and to hasten on to things invisible, and to have regard to those things which are not seen,-these, it says, constitute the wisdom of God.

But if this had been done, then though the power of baptizing were given them by the Lord, yet it would necessarily be called their own baptism, as in the case of the baptism of John. And so Paul gives thanks to God that he baptized none of those men who, as though forgetting in whose name they had been baptized, were for dividing themselves into factions under the names of different individuals.[fn-36-P3697_2062652:31-nf] For when baptism is as valid at the hands of a contemptible man as it was when given by an apostle, it is recognized as the baptism neither of this man nor of that, but of Christ; as John bears witness that he learned, in the case of the Lord Himself, through the appearance of the dove. For in what other respect he said, \"And I knew Him not,\" I cannot clearly see.

He knew Him, indeed, as the Son of God, the Bridegroom, of whose fullness all should receive; but whereas of His fullness he himself had so received the power of baptizing that it should be called the baptism of John, he did not know whether He would so give it to others also, or whether He would have His own baptism in such wise, that at whosesoever hands it was given, whether by a man that brought forth fruit a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, whether by the wheat or by the chaff, it should be known to be of Him alone; and this he learned through the Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding on Him.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_56_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"23.

For he would not say that he could maintain divine concord or the peace of the Lord with evil men; for the good man can observe peace towards wicked men, but he cannot be united with them in the peace which they have not. Lastly, that prescribing to no one, and prejudging no one, lest each bishop should not do what he thinks right in the free exercise of his own will, he has left for us also, whatsoever we may be, a place for treating peacefully of those things with him. For he is present, not only in his letters, but by that very charity which existed in so extraordinary a degree in him, and which can never die. Longing, therefore, with the aid of his prayers, to cling to and be in union with him, if I be not hindered by the unmeetness of my sins, I will learn if I can through his letters with how great peace and comfort the Lord administered His Church through him; and, putting on the bowels of humility through the moving influence of his discourse, if, in common with the Church at large, I entertain any doctrine more true than his, I will not prefer my heart to his, even in the point in which he, though holding different views, was yet not severed from the Church throughout the world. For in that, when that question was yet undecided for want of full discussion, though his sentiments differed from those of many of his colleagues, yet he observed so great moderation, that he would not mutilate the sacred fellowship of the Church of God by any stain of schism, a greater strength of excellence appeared in him than would have been shown if, without that virtue, he had held views on every point not only true, but coinciding with their own. Nor should I be acting as he would wish, if I were to pretend to prefer his talent and his fluency of discourse and copiousness of learning to the holy Council of all nations, whereat he was assuredly present through the unity of his spirit, especially as he is now placed in such full light of truth as to see with perfect certainty what he was here seeking in the spirit of perfect peace. For out of that rich abundance he smiles at all that here seems eloquence in us, as though it were the first essay of infancy; there he sees by what rule of piety he acted here, that nothing should be dearer in the Church to him than unity. There, too, with unspeakable delight he beholds with what prescient and most merciful providence the Lord, that He might heal our swellings, \"chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise,\"[fn-37-P3730_2075662:47-nf] and, in the ordering of the members of His Church, placed all things in such a healthful way, that men should not say that they were chosen to the help of the gospel for their own talent or learning, of whose source they yet were ignorant, and so be puffed up with deadly pride. Oh, how Cyprian rejoices! With how much more perfect calmness does he behold how greatly it conduces to the health of the human race, that in the writings even of Christian and pious orators there should be found what merits blame, and in the writings of the fishermen there should nothing of the sort be found! And so I, being fully assured of this joy of that holy soul, neither in any way venture to think or say that my writings are free from every kind of error, nor, in opposing that opinion of his, wherein it seemed to him that those who came from among heretics were to be received otherwise than either they had been in former days, as he himself bears witness, or are now received, as is the reasonable custom, confirmed by a plenary Council of the whole Christian world, do I set against him my own view, but that of the holy Catholic Church, which he so loved and loves, in which he brought forth such abundant fruit with tolerance, whose entirety he himself was not, but in whose entirety he remained; whose root he never left, but, though he already brought forth fruit from its root, he was purged by the heavenly Husbandman that he should bring forth more fruit;[fn-37-P3731_2077141:48-nf] for whose peace and safety, that the wheat might not be rooted out together with the tares, he both reproved with the freedom of truth, and endured with the grace of charity, so many evils on the part of men who were placed in unity with himself.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_56_book_v_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"37.

Christ then by one word laid Saul low, and raised up Paul; that is, He laid low the proud, and raised up the humble. For what was the reason of his change of name, that whereas he was afore called Saul, he chose afterwards to be called Paul; but that he acknowledged in himself that the name of Saul when he was a persecutor, had been a name of pride? He chose therefore a humble name; to be called Paul, that is, the least. For Paul is, \"the least.\" Paul is nothing else but little. And now glorying in this name, and giving us a lesson[fn-42-P4242_1808447:11-nf] of humility, he says, \"I am the least of the Apostles.\"[fn-42-P4243_1808520:12-nf] Whence then, whence was he, but of the people of the Jews? Of them were the other Apostles, of them was Paul, of them were they whom the same Paul mentions, as having seen the Lord after His resurrection. For he says, \"That He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.\"[fn-42-P4244_1808895:13-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXVII.

I Observe that it has been asked among the brethren what course ought specially to be adopted towards the persons of those who, although baptized in heresy, have yet been baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,[fn-107-P10722_3373880:1-nf] and subsequently departing from their heresy, and fleeing as supplicants to the Church of God, should repent with their whole hearts, and only now perceiving the condemnation of their error, implore from the Church the help of salvation. The point is whether, according to the most ancient custom and ecclesiastical tradition, it would suffice, after that baptism which they have received outside the Church indeed, but still in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, that only hands should be laid upon them by the bishop for their reception of the Holy Spirit, and this imposition of hands would afford them the renewed and perfected seal of faith; or whether, indeed, a repetition of baptism would be necessary for them, as if they should receive nothing if they had not obtained baptism afresh, just as if they were never baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And therefore some things were talked about as having been written and replied on this new question, wherein both sides endeavoured with the greatest eagerness to demolish what had been written by their antagonists. In which kind of debate, as it appears to me, no controversy or discussion could have arisen at all if each one of us had been content with the venerable authority of all the churches,[fn-107-P10723_3375224:2-nf] and with becoming humility had desired to innovate nothing, as observing no kind of room for contradiction. For everything which is both doubtful and ambiguous, and is established in opinions differing among those of prudent and faithful men, if it is judged to be against the ancient and memorable and most solemn observance of all those holy and faithful men who have deserved well, ought assuredly to be condemned; since in a matter once arranged and ordained, whatever that is which is brought forward against the quiet and peace of the Church, will result in nothing but discords, and strifes, and schisms. And in this no other fruit can be found but this alone; that one man, whoever he is, should be vain-gloriously declared among certain fickle men to be of great prudence and constancy: and, being gifted with the arrogance of heretics, whose only consolation in destruction is the not appearing to sin alone, should be renowned among those that are most similar and agreeable to himself, as having corrected the errors and vices of all the churches. For this is the desire and purpose of all heretics, to frame as many calumnies of this kind as possible against our most holy mother the Church, and to deem it a great glory to have discovered anything that can be imputed to her as a crime, or even as a folly. And since it becomes no faithful man of sound mind to dare to hold such a view, especially no one who is ordained in any clerical office at all, and much more in the episcopal order, it is like a prodigy for bishops themselves to devise such scandals, and not to fear to unfold too irreverently against the precept of the law and of all the Scriptures, with their own disgrace and risk, the disgrace of their mother the Church-if they think that there is any disgrace in this matter; although the Church has no disgrace in this instance, save in the error of such men as these themselves. Therefore it is the more grievous sin in men of this kind, if that which is blamed by them in the most ancient observance, as if it were not rightly done, is manifestly and forcibly shown as well to have been rightly observed by those who were before us, as to be rightly observed also by us; so that even if we should engage in the controversy with equal arguments on both sides, yet, since that which was innovated could not be established without dissension among the brethren and mischief to the Church, assuredly it ought not,-right or wrong, as they say, that is, contrary to what is good and proper-rashly to be flung like a stain upon our mother the Church; and the ignominy of this audacity and impiety ought with reason to be attached to those who should attempt this. But since it is not in our power, according to the apostle's precept, \"to speak the same thing, that there be not schisms among us; \"[fn-107-P10724_3378162:3-nf] yet, as far as we can, we strive to demonstrate the true condition of this argument, and to persuade turbulent men, even now, to mind their own business, as we shall even attain a great deal if they will at length acquiesce in this sound advice.[fn-107-P10725_3378425:4-nf] And therefore we shall, as is needful, collect into one mass whatever passages of the Holy Scriptures are pertinent to this subject. And we shall manifestly harmonize, as far as possible, those which seem to be differing or of various meaning; and we shall to the extent of our poor ability examine both the utility and advantage of each method, that we may recommend to all the brethren, that the most wholesome form and peaceful custom be adopted in the Church.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_56_letter_xiii_to_the_church_at_nicomedia_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For it is not lawful that the simple should meddle with that with which they have no concern, but which properly belongs to others. For you should each mind your own business, that so that which is most expedient may come about [and that your Church may again prosper], when those who have been dispersed have returned again to the unit of the one body, and spiritual peace is established by those who devoutly glorify God. To this end it is well, I think, to look out for high qualifications in your election, that he who is appointed to the Presidency may be suitable for the post. Now the Apostolic injunctions do not direct us to look to high birth, wealth, and distinction in the eyes of the world among the virtues of a Bishop; but if all this should, unsought, accompany your spiritual chiefs, we do not reject it, but consider it merely as a shadow accidentally[fn-43-P4325_2828956:3-nf] following the body; and none the less shall we welcome the more precious endowments, even though they happen to be apart from those boons of fortune. The prophet Amos was a goat-herd; Peter was a fisherman, and his brother Andrew followed the same employment; so too was the sublime John; Paul was a tent-maker, Matthew a publican, and the rest of the Apostles in the same way-not consuls, generals, prefects, or distinguished in rhetoric and philosophy, but poor, and of none of the learned professions, but starting from the more humble occupations of life: and yet for all that their voice went out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. \"Consider your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world[fn-43-P4326_2829975:4-nf] .\" Perhaps even now it is thought something foolish, as things appear to men, when one is not able to do much from poverty, or is slighted because of meanness of extraction[fn-43-P4327_2830179:5-nf] , not of character. But who knows whether the horn of anointing is not poured out by grace upon such an one, even though he be less than the lofty and more illustrious? Which was mere to the interest of the Church at Rome, that it should at its commencement be presided over by some high-born and pompous senator, or by the fisherman Peter, who had none of this world's advantages to attract men to him[fn-43-P4328_2830675:6-nf] ? What house had he, what slaves, what property ministering luxury, by wealth constantly flowing in? But that stranger, without a table, without a roof over his head, was richer than those who have all things, because through having nothing he had God wholly. So too the people of Mesopotamia, though they had among them wealthy satraps, preferred Thomas above them all to the presidency of their Church; the Cretans preferred Titus, the dwellers at Jerusalem James, and we Cappadocians the centurion, who at the Cross acknowledged the Godhead of the Lord, though there were many at that time of splendid lineage, whose fortunes enabled them to maintain a stud, and who prided themselves upon having the first place in the Senate. And in all the Church one may see those who are great according to God's standard preferred above worldly magnificence. You too, I think, ought to have an eye to these spiritual qualifications at this time present, if you really mean to revive the ancient glory of your Church. For nothing is better known to you than your own history, that anciently, before the city near you[fn-43-P4329_2832018:7-nf] flourished, the seat of government was with you, and among Bithynian cities there was nothing preeminent above yours. And now, it is true, the public buildings that once graced it have disappeared, but the city that consists in men-whether we look to numbers or to quality-is rapidly rising to a level with its former splendour. Accordingly it would well become you to entertain thoughts that shall not fall below the height of the blessings that now are yours, but to raise your enthusiasm in the work before you to the height of the magnificence of your city, that you may find such a one to preside over the laity as will prove himself not unworthy of you[fn-43-P4330_2833059:8-nf] . For it is disgraceful, brethren, and utterly monstrous, that while no one ever becomes a pilot unless he is skilled in navigation, he who sits at the helm of the Church should not know how to bring the souls of those who sail with him safe into the haven of God. How many wrecks of Churches, men and all, have ere now taken place by the inexperience of their heads! Who can reckon what disasters might not have been avoided, had there been aught of the pilot's skill in those who had command? Nay, we entrust iron, to make vessels with, not to those who know nothing about the matter, but to those who are acquainted with the art of the smith; ought we not therefore to trust souls to him who is well-skilled to soften them by the fervent heat of the Holy Spirit, and who by the impress of rational implements may fashion each one of you to be a chosen and useful vessel? It is thus that the inspired Apostle bids us to take thought, in his Epistle to Timothy[fn-43-P4331_2834047:9-nf] , laying injunction upon all who hear, when he says that a Bishop must be without reproach. Is this all that the Apostle cares for, that he who is advanced to the priesthood should be irreproachable? and what is so great an advantage as that all possible qualifications should be included in one? But he knows full well that the subject is moulded by the character of his superior, and that the upright walk of the guide becomes that of his followers too. For what the Master is, such does he make the disciple to be. For it is impossible that he who has been apprenticed to the art of the smith should practise that of the weaver, or that one who has only been taught to work at the loom should turn out an orator or a mathematician: but on the contrary that which the disciple sees in his master he adopts and transfers to himself. For this reason it is that the Scripture says, \"Every disciple that is perfect shall be as his master[fn-43-P4332_2835002:10-nf] .\" What then, brethren? Is it possible to be lowly and subdued in character, moderate, superior to the love of lucre, wise in things divine, and trained to virtue and considerateness in works and ways, without seeing those qualities in one's master? Nay, I do not know how a man can become spiritual, if he has been a disciple in a worldly school. For how can they who are striving to resemble their master fail to be like him? What advantage is the magnificence of the aqueduct to the thirsty, if there is no water in it, even though the symmetrical disposition of columns[fn-43-P4333_2835717:11-nf] variously shaped rear aloft the pediment[fn-43-P4334_2835793:12-nf] ? Which would the thirsty man rather choose for the supply of his own need, to see marbles beautifully disposed or to find good spring water, even if it flowed through a wooden pipe, as long as the stream which it poured forth was clear and drinkable? Even so, brethren, those who look to godliness should neglect the trappings of outward show, and whether a man exults in powerful friends, or plumes himself on the long list of his dignities, or boasts that he receives large annual revenues, or is puffed up with the thought of his noble ancestry, or has his mind on all sides clouded[fn-43-P4335_2836394:13-nf] with the fumes of self-esteem, should have nothing to do with such an one, any more than with a dry aqueduct, if he display not in his life the primary and essential qualities for high office. But, employing the lamp of the Spirit for the search[fn-43-P4336_2836660:14-nf] , you should, as far as is possible, seek for \"a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed[fn-43-P4337_2837688:15-nf] ,\" that, by your election the garden of delight having been opened and the water of the fountain having been unstopped, there may be a common acquisition to the Catholic Church. May God grant that there may soon be found among you such an one, who shall be a chosen vessel, a pillar of the Church. But we trust in the Lord that so it will be, if you are minded by the grace of concord with one mind to see that which is good, preferring to your own wills the will of the Lord, and that which is approved of Him, and perfect, and well-pleasing in His eyes; that there may be such a happy issue among you, that therein we may rejoice, and you triumph, and the God of all be glorified, Whom glory becometh for ever and ever.","title":"Letter XIII.

In consideration of which expectation it is said, \"Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart; wait, I say, upon the Lord.\"[fn-55-P5563_2685232:19-nf] For the greatest palm of toleration is won by those who, among false brethren that have crept in unawares, seeking their own, and not the things of Jesus Christ, yet show that they on their part seek not to disturb the love which is not their own, but Jesus Christ's, by any turbulent or rash dissension, nor to break the unity of the Lord's net, in which are gathered together fish of every kind; till it is drawn to the shore, that is, till the end of time, by any wicked strife fostered in the spirit of pride: whilst each might think himself to be something, being really nothing, and so might lead himself astray, and wish that sufficient reason might be found for the separation of Christian peoples in the judgment of himself or of his friends, who declare that they know beyond all question certain wicked men unworthy of communion in the sacraments of the Christian religion: though whatever it may be that they know of them, they cannot persuade the universal Church, which, as it was foretold, is spread abroad throughout all nations, to give credit to their tale. And when they refuse communion with these men, as men whose character they know, they desert the unity of the Church; whereas they ought rather, if there really were in them that charity which endureth all things, themselves to bear what they know in one nation, lest they should separate themselves from the good whom they were unable throughout all nations to fill with the teaching of evil alien to them. Whence even, without discussing the case, in which they are convicted by the weightiest proofs of having uttered calumnies against the innocent, they are believed with greater probability to have invented false charges of giving up the sacred books, when they are found to have themselves committed the far more heinous crime of wicked division in the Church. For even, if whatever imputations they have cast of giving up the sacred books were true, yet they in no wise ought to have abandoned the society of Christians, who are commended by holy Scripture even to the ends of the world, on considerations which they have been familiar with, while these men showed that they were not acquainted with them.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_62_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"8.

For this is their sole object, that the origin, and root, and head of him that is baptized should be none other than he by whom he is baptized.\"[fn-58-P5825_2811731:127-nf] These words, and this confirmation from the writings of the apostle, he has quoted from my epistle, and he has proposed to himself the task of refuting them. Go on then, I beg of you, to see how he has fulfilled the task. For he says, \"This assertion is meaningless, and inflated, and childish, and foolish, and something very far from a true exposition of our faith. For you would only be right in asserting this, if we were to say, We have been baptized in the name of Donatus, or Donatus was crucified for us, or we have been baptized in our own name. But since such things as this neither have been said nor are said by us,-seeing that we follow the formula of the holy Trinity,-it is dear that you are mad to bring such accusations against us. Or if you think that we have been baptized in the name of Donatus, or in our own name, you are miserably deceived, and at the same time confess in your sacrilege that you on your part defile your wretched selves in the name of Caecilianus.\" This is the answer which Petilianus has made to those arguments of mine, not supposing-or rather making a noise that no one might suppose-that he has made no answer at all which could bear in any way upon the question which is under discussion. For who could fail to see that this witness of the apostle has been adduced by us with all the more propriety, in that you do not say that you were baptized in the name of Donatus, or that Donatus was crucified for you, and yet separate yourselves from the communion of the Catholic Church out of respect to the party of Donatus; as also those whom Paul was rebuking certainly did not say that they had been baptized in the name of Paul, or that Paul has been crucified for them, and yet they were making a schism in the name of Paul. As therefore in their case, for whom Christ, not Paul, was crucified, and who were baptized in the name of Christ, not of Paul, and who yet said, \"I am of Paul,\" the rebuke is used with all the more propriety, \"Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\" to make them cling to Him who was crucified for them, and in whose name they were baptized, and not be guilty of division in the name of Paul; so in your case, also, the rebuke, Was Donatus crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Donatus? is used all the more appositely, because you do not say, We were baptized in the name of Donatus, and yet desire to be of the party of Donatus. For you know that it was Christ who was crucified for you, and Christ in whose name you were baptized; and yet, out of respect to the name and party of Donatus, you show such obstinacy in fighting against the unity of Christ, who was crucified for you, and in whose name you were baptized.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_62_book_iii_","source_chapter":55,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"67.

The sametraining would also be exceedingly useful in the case of all who are under suspicion of being in a state of hostility to sound doctrine, and who by ingenious and plausible excuses keep the depravity of their sentiments out of view. For these too this creed is all that is needed. They will either get cured of their concealed unsoundness, or, by continuing to keep it concealed, will themselves bear the load of the sentence due to their dishonesty, and will provide us with an easy defence in the day of judgment, when the Lord will lift the cover from the hidden things of darkness, and \"make manifest the counsels of the hearts.\"[fn-40-P4073_1300109:3-nf] It is therefore desirable to receive them with the confession not only that they believe in the words put forth by our fathers at Nicaea, but also according to the sound meaning expressed by those words, For there are men who even in this creed pervert the word of truth, and wrest the meaning of the words in it to suit their own notions. So Marcellus, when expressing impious sentiments concerning the hypostasis of our Lord Jesus Christ, and describing Him as being Logos and nothing more,[fn-40-P4074_1300618:4-nf] had the hardihood to profess to find a pretext for his principles in that creed by affixing an improper sense upon the Homoousion. Some, moreover, of the impious following of the Libyan Sabellius, who understand hypostasis and substance to be identical, derive ground for the establishment of their blasphemy from the same source, because of its having been written in the creed \"if any one says that the Son is of a different substance or hypostasis, the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes him.\" But they did not there state hypostasis and substance to be identical. Had the words expressed one and the same meaning, what need of both? It is on the contrary clear that while by some it was denied that the Son was of the same substance with the Father, and some asserted that He was not of the substance and was of some other hypostasis, they thus condemned both opinions as outside that held by the Church. When they set forth their own view, they declared the Son to be of the substance of the Father, but they did not add the words \"of the hypostasis.\" The former clause stands for the condemnation of the faulty view; the latter plainly states the dogma of salvation. We are therefore bound to confess the Son to be of one substance with the Father, as it is written; but the Father to exist in His own proper hypostasis, the Son in His, and the Holy Ghost in His, as they themselves have clearly delivered the doctrine. They indeed clearly and satisfactorily declared in the words Light of Light, that the Light which begat and the Light which was begotten, are distinct, and yet Light and Light; so that the definition of the Substance is one and the same.[fn-40-P4075_1302632:5-nf] I will now subjoin the actual creed as it was drawn up at Nicaea.[fn-40-P4076_1303666:6-nf] ","title":"Letter CXXV","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_40_to_the_bishops_of_egypt","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"It appears then that so far as these doctrines are concerned, these wonderful men have now joined themselves to the Manichees.

But inasmuch as they deny Him who is truly and indeed God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things invisible, they are mere inventors of fables. And this appears to me to be the case with these evil-minded men. They see the works of the true Word who alone is in the Father, and yet they deny Him, and make to themselves another Word[fn-40-P4029_1689991:86-nf] , whose existence they are unable to prove either by His Works or by the testimony of others. Unless it be that they have adopted a fabulous notion of God, that He is a composite being like man, speaking and then changing His words, and as a man exercising understanding and wisdom; not perceiving to what absurdities they are reduced by such an opinion. For if God has a succession of words[fn-40-P4030_1690422:87-nf] , they certainly must consider Him as a man. And if those words proceed from Him and then vanish away, they are guilty of a greater impiety, because they resolve into nothing what proceeds from the self-existent God. If they conceive that God doth at all beget, it were surely better and more religious to say that He is the begetter of One Word, who is the fulness of His Godhead, in whom are hidden the treasures of all knowledge[fn-40-P4031_1690880:88-nf] , and that He is co-existent with His Father, and that all things were made by Him; rather than to suppose God to be the Father of many words which are nowhere to be found, or to represent Him who is simple in His nature as compounded of many[fn-40-P4032_1691156:89-nf] , and as being subject to human passions and variable. Next whereas the Apostle says, `Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God[fn-40-P4033_1691314:90-nf] ,' these men reckon Him but as one among many powers; nay, worse than this, they compare Him, transgressors as they are, with the cankerworm and other irrational creatures which are sent by Him for the punishment of men. Next, whereas the Lord says, `Noone knoweth the Father, save the Son[fn-40-P4034_1691623:91-nf] ;' and again, `Not that any man hath seen the Father save He which is of the Father[fn-40-P4035_1691726:92-nf] ;' are not these indeed enemies of God which say that the Father is neither seen nor known of the Son perfectly? If the Lord says, `As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father[fn-40-P4036_1691928:93-nf] ,' and if the Father knows not the Son partially, are they not mad to say idly that the Son knows the Father only partially, and not fully? Next, if the Son has a beginning of existence, and all things likewise have a beginning, let them say, which is prior to the other. But indeed they have nothing to say, neither can they with all their craft prove such a beginning of the Word. For He is the true and proper Offspring of the Father, and `in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-40-P4037_1692467:94-nf] .' For with regard to their assertion, that the Son knows not His own essence, it is superfluous to reply to it, except only so far as to condemn their madness; for how does not the Word know Himself, when He imparts to all men the knowledge of His Father and of Himself, and blames those who know not themselves?

He that cometh from above is above all\"-this is Christ; and \"he that is of the earth, is of earth, and speaketh of the earth \"-this is John. And is this the whole: John is of the earth, and speaks of the earth? Is the whole testimony that he bears of Christ a speaking of the earth? Are they not voices of God that are heard from John, when he bears witness of Christ? Then how does he speak of the earth? He said this of man. So far as relates to man in himself, he is of earth, and speaks of the earth; and when he speaks some divine things, he is enlightened by God. For, were he not enlightened, he would be earth speaking of earth. God's grace is apart by itself, the nature of man apart by itself. Do but examine the nature of man: man is born and grows, he learns the customs of men. What does he know but earth, of earth? He speaks the things of men, knows the things of men, minds the things of men; carnal, he judges carnally, conjectures carnally: lo! it is man all over. Let the grace of God come, and enlighten his darkness, as it saith, \"Thou wilt lighten my candle, O Lord; my God, enlighten my darkness;\"[fn-8-P827_442884:4-nf] let it take the mind of man, and turn it to its own light; immediately he begins to say, as the apostle says, \"Yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me;\"[fn-8-P828_443063:5-nf] and, \"Now I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\"[fn-8-P829_443136:6-nf] That is to say, \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" Thus John: as regards John, he is of the earth, and speaks of the earth; whatever that is divine thou hast heard from John, is of Him that enlightens, not of him that receives.","title":"Tractate XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_65_homily_lix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And if He saith \"by whom,\"[fn-58-P5868_1800051:11-nf] marvel not.

But men continually injure themselves exceedingly in their fear to offend others. For good friends have much influence for good, andevil friends for evil. Therefore it was not the Lord's will to choose first senators, but fishermen, to teach us for our own salvation to disregard the friendship of the powerful. O signal mercy of the Creator! For He knew that had He chosen the senator, he would say, \"My rank has been chosen.\" If He had first made choice of the rich man, he would say, \"My wealth has been chosen.\" If He had first made choice of an emperor, he would say,\" My power has been chosen.\" If the orator he would say, \"My eloquence has been chosen.\" If of the philosopher, he would say, \"My wisdom has been chosen.\" Meanwhile He says, let these proud ones be put off awhile, they swell too much. Now there is much difference between substantial size and swelling; both indeed are large, but both are not alike sound. Let them then, He says, be put off, these proud ones, they must be cured by something solid. First give Me, He says, this fisherman. \"Come, thou poor one, follow Me; thou hast nothing, thou knowest nothing, follow Me. Thou poor and ignorant[fn-46-P4655_1992223:23-nf] one, follow Me. There is nothing in thee to inspire awe, but there is much in thee to be filled.\" To so copious a fountain an empty vessel should be brought. So the fisherman left his nets, the fisherman received grace, and became a divine orator. See what the Lord did, of whom the Apostle says, \"God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and base things of the world hath God chosen, yea and things which are not, as if they were, that those things which are may be brought to nought.\"[fn-46-P4656_1992768:24-nf] And so now the fishermen's words are read, and the necks of orators are brought down.

He had said, \"The Son cannot of Himself do anything, but what He seeth the Father doing.\" We, however, understood it not that the Father doeth something separately, which when the Son seeth, Himself also doeth something of the same kind, after seeing His Father's work; but when He said, \"The Son cannot of Himself do anything, but what He seeth the Father doing,\" we understood it that the Son is wholly of the Father-that His whole substance and His whole power are of the Father that begat Him. But just now, when He had said that He doeth in like manner these things which the Father doeth, that we may not understand it to mean that the Father doeth some, the Son others, but that the Son with like power doeth the very same which the Father doeth, whilst the Father doeth through the Son, He went on, and said what we have heard read to-day: \"For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that Himself doeth.\" Again mortal thought is disturbed. The Father showeth to the Son what things Himself doeth; therefore, saith some one, the Father doeth separately, that the Son may be able to see what He doeth. Again, there occur to human thought, as it were, two artificers-as, for instance, a carpenter teaching his son his own art, and showing him whatever he doeth, that the son also may be able to do it. \"Showeth Him,\" saith He, \"all things that Himself doeth.\" Is it therefore so, that whilst He doeth, the Son doeth not, that He may be able to see the Father do? Yet, certainly, \"all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\" Hence we see how the Father showeth the Son what He doeth, since the Father doeth nothing but what He doeth through the Son. What hath the Father made? He made the world. Hath He shown the world, when made, to the Son in such wise, that the Son also should make something like it? Then let us see the world which the Son made. Nevertheless, both\" all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made,\" and also \"the world was made by Him.\"[fn-10-P1077_651406:2-nf] If the world was made by Him, and all things were made by Him, and the Father doeth nothing save by the Son, where cloth the Father show to the Son what He doeth, if it be not in the Son Himself, through whom He doeth? In what place can the work of the Father be shown to the Son,as though He were doing and sitting outside, and the Son attentively watching the Father's hand how it maketh? Where is that inseparable Trinity? Where the Word, of which it is said that the same is \"the power and the wisdom of God\"?[fn-10-P1078_651938:3-nf] Where that which the Scripture saith of the same wisdom: \"For it is the brightness of the eternal light?\"[fn-10-P1079_652062:4-nf] Where what was said of it again: \"It powerfully reaches from the end even to the end, and ordereth all things sweetly\"?[fn-10-P1080_652200:5-nf] Whatever the Father doeth, He doeth through the Son: through His wisdom and his power He doeth; not from without doth He show to the Son what He may see, but in the Son Himself He showeth Him what He doeth.","title":"Tractate XXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_71_homily_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Paul is at great pains to show that faith is mighty to a degree which was never even fancied of the Law.

When our Lord Jesus Christ, as we have heard in the Gospel when it was read, had said that He was Himself the bread which came down from heaven, the Jews murmured and said, \"Is not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?\" These Jews were far off from the bread of heaven, and knew not how to hunger after it. They had the jaws of their heart languid; with open ears they were deaf, they saw and stood blind. This bread, indeed, requires the hunger of the inner man: and hence He saith in another place, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.\"[fn-12-P1263_797648:1-nf] But the Apostle Paul says that Christ is for us righteousness.[fn-12-P1264_797726:2-nf] And, consequently, he that hungers after this bread, hungers after righteousness,-that righteousness however which cometh down from heaven, the righteousness that God gives, not that which man works for himself. For if man were not making a righteousness for himself, the same apostle would not have said of the Jews: \"For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, they are not subject to the righteousness of God.\"[fn-12-P1265_798212:3-nf] Of such were these who understood not the bread that cometh down from heaven; because being satisfied with their own righteousness, they hungered not after the righteousness of God. What is this, God's righteousness and man's righteousness? God's righteousness here means, not that wherein God is righteous, but that which God bestows on man, that man may be righteous through God. But again, what was the righteousness of those Jews? A righteousness wrought of their own strength on which they presumed, and so declared themselves as if they were fulfillers of the law by their own virtue. But no man fulfills the law but he whom grace assists, that is, whom the bread that cometh down from heaven assists. \"For the fulfilling of the law,\" as the apostle says in brief, \"is charity.\"[fn-12-P1266_799011:4-nf] Charity, that is, love, not of money, but of God; love, not of earth nor of heaven, but of Him who made Heaven and earth. Whence can man have that love? Let us hear the same: \"The love of God,\" saith he, \"is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.\"[fn-12-P1267_799307:5-nf] Wherefore, the Lord, about to give the Holy Spirit, said that Himself was the bread that came down from heaven, exhorting us to believe on Him. For to believe on Him is to eat the living bread. He that believes eats; he is sated invisibly, because invisibly is he born again. A babe within, a new man within.

At his suggestion then ye have maintained and ye think, that `there was once when the Son was not;' this is the first cloke of your views of doctrine which has to be stripped off Say then what was once when the Son was not, O slanderous and irreligious men[fn-53-P5347_2095608:61-nf] ? If ye say the Father, your blasphemy is but greater; for it is impious to say that He was `once,' or to signify Him by the word `once.' For He is ever, and is now, and as the Son is, so is He, and is Himself He that is, and Father of the Son. But if ye say that the Son was once, when He Himself was not, the answer is foolish and unmeaning. For how could He both be and not be? In this difficulty, you can but answer, that there was a time when the Word was not; for your very adverb `once' naturally signifies this. And your other, `The Son was not before His generation,' is equivalent to saying, `There was once when He was not,' for both the one and the other signify that there is a time before the Word. Whence then this your discovery? Why do ye, as `the heathen, rage, and imagine vain phrases against the Lord[fn-53-P5348_2097288:62-nf] and against His Christ?' for no holy Scripture has used such language of the Saviour, but rather `always' and `eternal' and `coexistent always with the Father.' For, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-53-P5349_2097550:63-nf] .' And in the Apocalypse be thus speaks[fn-53-P5350_2097606:64-nf] ; `Who is and who was and who is to come.' Now who can rob `who is' and `who was' of eternity? This too in confutation of the Jews hath Paul written in his Epistle to the Romans, `Of whom as concerning the flesh is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever[fn-53-P5351_2098007:65-nf] ;' while silencing the Greeks, he has said, `The visible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead[fn-53-P5352_2098225:66-nf] ;' and what the Power of God is, he teaches us elsewhere himself, `Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-53-P5353_2098354:67-nf] .' Surely in these words he does not designate the Father, as ye often whisper one to another, affirming that the Father is `His eternal power.' This is not so; for he says not, `God Himself is the power,' but `His is the power.' Very plain is it to all that `His' is not `He;' yet not something alien but rather proper to Him. Study too the context and `turn to the Lord;' now `the Lord is that Spirit[fn-53-P5354_2099006:68-nf] ;'and you will see that it is the Son who is signified.

However, I suppose even they will be unwilling to proceed to such lengths, if they follow Asterius the sophist. For he, earnest as he is in his advocacy of the Arian heresy, and maintaining that the Unoriginate is one, runs counter to them in saying, that the Wisdom of God is unoriginate and without beginning also. The following is a passage out of his work[fn-55-P5503_2177479:180-nf] : `The Blessed Paul said not that he preached Christ the power of God or the wisdom of God, but, without the article, `God's power and God's wisdom[fn-55-P5504_2177661:181-nf] ;' thus preaching that the proper power of God Himself, which is natural to Him and co-existent with Him unoriginatedly, is something besides.' And again, soon after: `However, His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without beginning and unoriginate; this must surely be one.' For though, misunderstanding the Apostle's words, he considered that there were two wisdoms; yet, by speaking still of a wisdom coexistent with Him, he declares that the Unoriginate is not simply one, but that there is another Unoriginate with Him. For what is coexistent, coexists not with itself, but with another. If then they agree with Asterius, let them never ask again, `Is the Unoriginate one or two,' or they will have to contest the point with him; if, on the other hand, they differ even from him, let them not rely upon his treatise, lest, `biting one another, they be consumed one of another[fn-55-P5505_2178580:182-nf] .' So much on the point of their ignorance; but who can say enough on their crafty character? who but would justly hate them while possessed by such a madness? for when they were no longer allowed to say `out of nothing' and `He was not before His generation,' they hit upon this word `unoriginate,' that, by saying among the simple that the Son was `originate,' they might imply the very same phrases `out of nothing,' and `He once was not;' for in such phrases things originated and creatures are implied.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"41. And if, as David says in the 71st Psalm, `His Name remaineth before the sun, and before the moon, from one generation to another[fn-55-P5567_2203895:229-nf] ,' how did He receive what He had always, even before He now received it? or how is He exalted, being before His exaltation the Most High? or how did He receive the right of being worshipped, who before He now received it, was ever worshipped? It is not a dark saying but a divine mystery[fn-55-P5568_2204225:230-nf] . `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;' but for our sakes afterwards the `Word was made flesh[fn-55-P5569_2204940:231-nf] .' And the term in question, `highly exalted,' does not signify that the essence of the Word was exalted, for He was ever and is `equal to God[fn-55-P5570_2205113:232-nf] ,' but the exaltation is of the manhood. Accordingly this is not said before the Word became flesh; that it might be plain that `humbled' and `exalted' are spoken of His human nature; for where there is humble estate, there too may be exaltation; and if because of His taking flesh `humbled' is written, it is clear that `highly exalted' is also said because of it. For of this was man's nature in want, because of the humble estate of the flesh and of death. Since then the Word, being the Image of the Father and immortal, took the form of the servant, and as man underwent for us death in His flesh, that thereby He might offer Himself for us through death to the Father; therefore also, as man, He is said because of us and for us to be highly exalted, that as by His death we all died in Christ, so again in the Christ Himself we might be highly exalted, being raised from the dead, and ascending into heaven, `whither the forerunner Jesus is for us entered, not into the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us[fn-55-P5571_2206198:233-nf] .' But if now for us the Christ is entered into heaven itself, though He was even before and always Lord and Framer of the heavens, for us therefore is that present exaltation written. And as He Himself, who sanctifies all, says also that He sanctifies Himself to the Father for our sakes, not that the Word may become holy, but that He Himself may in Himself sanctify all of us, in like manner we must take the present phrase, `He highly exalted Him,' not that He Himself should be exalted, for He is the highest, but that He may become righteousness for us[fn-55-P5572_2206790:234-nf] , and we may be exalted in Him, and that we may enter the gates of heaven, which He has also opened for us, the forerunners saying, `Lift up your gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in[fn-55-P5573_2207573:235-nf] .' For here also not on Him were shut the gates, as being Lord and Maker of all, but because of us is this too written, to whom the door of paradise was shut. And therefore in a human relation, because of the flesh which He bore, it is said of Him, `Lift up your gates,' and `shall come in,' as if a man were entering; but in a divine relation on the other hand it is said of Him, since `the Word was God,' that He is the `Lord' and the `King of Glory.' Such our exaltation the Spirit foreannounced in the eighty-ninth Psalm, saying, `And in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted, for Thou art the glory of their strength[fn-55-P5574_2208217:236-nf] .'

That the Christ then must be such as the Scriptures say, you will plainly confess yourselves. For those announcements come from God, and in them falsehood cannot be. If then ye can state that such a one has come before, and can prove him God from the signs and wonders which he did, ye have reason for maintaining the contest, but if ye are not able to prove His coming, but are expecting such an one still, recognise the true season from Daniel, for his words relate to the present time. But if this present season be that which was of old, afore-announced, and ye have seen what has taken place among us, be sure that this Jesus, whom ye crucified, this is the expected Christ. For David and all the Prophets died, and the sepulchres of all are with you, but that Resurrection which has now taken place, has shewn that the scope of these passages is Jesus. For the crucifixion is denoted by `Ye shall see your Life hanging,' and the wound in the side by the spear answers to `He was led as a sheep to the slaughter[fn-59-P5908_2359040:88-nf] ,' and the resurrection, nay more, the rising of the ancient dead from out their sepulchres (for these most of you have seen), this is, `Thou shall not leave My soul in hades,' and `He swallowed up death in strength[fn-59-P5909_2359274:89-nf] ,' and again, `God will wipe away.' For the signs which actually took place shew that He who was in a body was God, and also the Life and Lord of death. For it became the Christ, when giving life to others, Himself not to be detained by death; but this could not have happened, had He, as you suppose, been a mere man. But in truth He is the Son of God, for men are all subject to death. Let no one therefore doubt, but the whole house of Israel know assuredly that this Jesus, whom ye saw in shape a man, doing signs and such works, as no one ever yet had done, is Himself the Christ and Lord of all. For though made man, and called Jesus, as we said before, He received no loss by that human passion, but rather, in being made man, He is manifested as Lord of quick and dead. For since, as the Apostle said, `in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe[fn-59-P5910_2360230:90-nf] .' And so, since we men would not acknowledge God through His Word, nor serve the Word of God our natural Master, it pleased God to shew in man His own Lordship, and so to draw all men to Himself. But to do this by a mere man be-seemed not[fn-59-P5911_2360490:91-nf] ; lest, having man for our Lord, we should become worshippers of man[fn-59-P5912_2360915:92-nf] . Therefore the Word Himself became flesh, and the Father called His Name Jesus, and so `made' Him Lord and Christ, as much as to say, `He made Him to rule and to reign;' that while in the Name of Jesus, whom ye crucified, every knee bows, we may acknowledge as Lord and King both the Son and through Him the Father.\"","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"32.

Wherefore I am in wonder how, whereas God is One, these men introduce, after their private notions, many images and wisdoms and words[fn-60-P6093_2427051:240-nf] , and say that the Father's proper and natural Word is other than the Son, by whom He even made the Son[fn-60-P6094_2427599:241-nf] and that He who is really Son is but notionally[fn-60-P6095_2427839:242-nf] called Word, as vine, and way, and door, and tree of life; and that He is called Wisdom also in name, the proper and true Wisdom of the Father, which coexist ingenerately[fn-60-P6096_2428124:243-nf] with Him, being other than the Son, by which He even made the Son, and named Him Wisdom as partaking of it. This they have not confined to words, but Arius composed in his Thalia, and the Sophist Asterius wrote, what we have stated above, as follows: `Blessed Paul said not that he preached Christ, the Power of God or the Wisdom of God,' but without the addition of the article, `God's power' and `God's wisdom[fn-60-P6097_2428590:244-nf] ,' thus preaching that the proper Power of God Himself which is natural to Him, and co-existent in Him ingenerately, is something besides, generative indeed of Christ, and creative of the whole world, concerning which he teaches in his Epistle to the Romans thus,-`The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead[fn-60-P6098_2429034:245-nf] .' For as no one would say that the Godhead there mentioned was Christ, but the Father Himself, so, as I think, `His eternal Power and Godhead also is not the Only Begotten Son, but the Father who begat Him[fn-60-P6099_2429260:246-nf] .' And he teaches that there is another power and wisdom of God, manifested through Christ. And shortly after the same Asterius says, `However His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without beginning and ingenerate, the same must surely be one. For there are many wisdoms which are one by one created by Him, of whom Christ is the first-born and only-begotten; all however equally depend on their Possessor. And all the powers are rightly called His who created and uses them:-as the Prophet says that the locust, which came to be a divine punishment of human sins, was called by God Himself not only a power, but a great power; and blessed David in most of the Psalms invites, not the Angels alone, but the Powers to praise God.'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"42. Therefore, when He made His promise to the saints, He thus spoke; `I and the Father will come, and make Our abode in him;' and again, `that, as I and Thou are One, so they may be one in Us.'

For the light must be with the ray, and the radiance must be contemplated together with its own light. Whence the Jews, as denying the Son as well as they, have not the Father either; for, as having left the `Fountain of Wisdom[fn-61-P6130_2445371:272-nf] ,' as Baruch reproaches them, they put from them the Wisdom springing from it, our Lord Jesus Christ (for `Christ,' says the Apostle, is `God's power and God's wisdom[fn-61-P6131_2445559:273-nf] ),' when they said, `We have no king but Caesar[fn-61-P6132_2445628:274-nf] .' The Jews then have the penal award of their denial; for their city as well as their reasoning came to nought. And these too hazard the fulness of the mystery, I mean Baptism; for if the consecration is given to us into the Name of Father and Son, and they do not confess a true Father, because they deny what is from Him and like His Essence, and deny also the true Son, and name another of their own framing as created out of nothing, is not the rite administered by them altogether empty and unprofitable, making a show, but in reality being no help towards religion? For the Arians do not baptize into Father and Son, but into Creator and creature, and into Maker and work[fn-61-P6133_2446328:275-nf] . And as a creature is other than the Son, so the Baptism, which is supposed to be given by them, is other than the truth, though they pretend to name the Name of the Father and the Son, because of the words of Scripture, For not he who simply says, `O Lord,' gives Baptism; but he who with the Name has also the right faith[fn-61-P6134_2446684:276-nf] . On this account therefore our Saviour also did not simply command to baptize, but first says, `Teach;' then thus: `Baptize into the Name of Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost;' that the right faith might follow upon learning, and together with faith might come the consecration of Baptism.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"62. But if He is also called `First-born of the creation[fn-62-P6296_2510263:409-nf] ,' still this is not as if He were levelled to the creatures, and only first of them in point of time (for how should that be, since He is `Only-begotten?'), but it is because of the Word's condescension[fn-62-P6297_2510714:410-nf] to the creatures, according to which He has become the `Brother' of `many.' For the term `Only-begotten' is used where there are no brethren, but `First-born[fn-62-P6298_2511565:411-nf] ' because of brethren. Accordingly it is nowhere written in the Scriptures, `the first-born of God,' nor `the creature of God;' but `Only-begotten' and `Son' and `Word' and `Wisdom,' refer to Him as proper to the Father[fn-62-P6299_2511812:412-nf] . Thus, `We have seen His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father[fn-63-P6300_2512365:413-nf] ;' and `God sent His Only-begotten Son[fn-63-P6301_2512423:414-nf] ;' and `O Lord, Thy Word endureth for ever[fn-63-P6302_2512487:415-nf] ;' and `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God;' and `Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-63-P6303_2512625:416-nf] ;' and `This is My beloved Son;' and `Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God[fn-63-P6304_2512731:417-nf] .' But `first-born' implied the descent to the creation[fn-63-P6305_2512824:418-nf] ; for of it has He been called first-born; and `He created' implies His grace towards the works, for for them is He created. If then He is Only-begotten, as indeed He is, `First-born' needs some explanation; but if He be really First-born, then He is not Only-begotten[fn-63-P6306_2513246:419-nf] . For the same cannot be both Only-begotten and First-born, except in different relations;-that is, Only-begotten, because of His generation from the Father, as has been said; and First-born, because of His condescension to the creation and His making the many His brethren. Certainly, those two terms being inconsistent with each other, one should say that the attribute of being Only-begotten has justly the preference in the instance of the Word, in that there is no other Word, or other Wisdom, but He alone is very Son of the Father. Moreover[fn-63-P6307_2513947:420-nf] , as was before[fn-63-P6308_2514371:421-nf] said, not in connection with any reason, but absolutely[fn-63-P6309_2514441:422-nf] it is said of Him, `The Only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father[fn-63-P6310_2514651:423-nf] ;' but the word `First-born' has again the creation as a reason in connection with it, which Paul proceeds to say, `for in Him all things were created[fn-63-P6311_2514821:424-nf] .'

For the wisdom in the world is not creative, but is that which is created in the works, according to which `the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handywork[fn-64-P6459_2567807:551-nf] .'

And, as some son of a king, when the father wished to build a city[fn-64-P6462_2568154:554-nf] , might cause his own name to be printed upon each of the works that were rising, both to give security to them of the works remaining, by reason of the show of his name on everything, and also to make them remember him and his father from the name, and having finished the city might be asked concerning it, how it was made, and then would answer, `It is made securely, for according to the will of my father, I am imaged in each work, for my name was made in the works;' but saying this, he does not signify that his own essence is created, but the impress of himself by means of his name; in the same manner, to apply the illustration, to those who admire the wisdom in the creatures, the true Wisdom makes answer, `The Lord created me for the works,' for my impress is in them; and I have thus condescended for the framing of all things.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"81. But since He proceeds to say, `When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him[fn-64-P6473_2572690:563-nf] ,' we ought to know that He says not this as if without Wisdom the Father prepared the heaven or the clouds above (for there is no room to doubt that all things are created in Wisdom, and without It was made not even one[fn-64-P6474_2572932:564-nf] thing); but this is what He says, `All things took place in Me and through Me, and when there was need that Wisdom should be,created in the works, in My Essence indeed I was with the Father, but by a condescension[fn-64-P6475_2573164:565-nf] to things originate, I was disposing over the works My own impress, so that the whole world as being in one body, might not be at variance but in concord with itself.' All those then who with an upright understanding, according to the wisdom given unto them, come to contemplate the creatures, are able to say for themselves, `By Thy appointment all things continue[fn-64-P6476_2573773:566-nf] ;' but they who make light of this must be told, `Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools;' for `that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has revealed it unto them; for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.

But if it belong to none other than God to bless and to deliver, and none other was the deliverer of Jacob than the Lord Himself and Him that delivered him the Patriarch besought for his grandsons, evidently none other did he join to God in his prayer, than God's Word, whom therefore he called Angel, because it is He alone who reveals the Father.

If, for instance, it were possible for us to become as the Son in the Father, the words ought to run, `that they may be one in Thee,' as the Son is in the Father; but, as it is, He has not said this; but by saying `in Us' He has pointed out the distance and difference; that He indeed is alone in the Father alone, as Only Word and Wisdom; but we in the Son, and through Him in the Father. And thus speaking, He meant this only, `By Our unity may they also be so one with each other, as We are one in nature and truth; for otherwise they could not be one, except by learning unity in Us.' And that `in Us' has this signification, we may learn from Paul, who says, `These things I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos, that ye may learn in us not to be puffed up above that is written[fn-66-P6684_2653408:163-nf] .' The words `in Us' then, are not `in the Father,' as the Son is in Him; but imply an example and image, instead of saying, `Let them learn of Us.' For as Paul to the Corinthians, so is the oneness of the Son and the Father a pattern and lesson to all, by which they may learn, looking to that natural unity of the Father and the Son, how they themselves ought to be one in spirit towards each other. Or if it needs to account for the phrase otherwise, the words `in Us' may mean the same as saying, that in the power of the Father and the Son they may be one, speaking the same things[fn-66-P6685_2654016:164-nf] ; for without God this is impossible. And this mode of speech also we may find in the divine writings, as `In God will we do great acts;' and `In God I shall leap over the wall[fn-66-P6686_2654219:165-nf] ;' and `In Thee will we tread down our enemies[fn-66-P6687_2654300:166-nf] .' Therefore it is plain, that in the Name of Father and Son we shall be able, becoming one, to hold firm the bond of charity. For, dwelling still on the same thought, the Lord says, `And the glory which Thou gavest Me, I have given to them, that they may be one as We are one.' Suitably has He here too said, not, `that they may be in Thee as I am,' but `as We are;' now he who says `as'[fn-66-P6688_2654774:167-nf] , signifies not identity, but an image and example of the matter in hand.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"30. The reader then of divine Scripture may acquaint himself with these passages from the ancient books; and from the Gospels on the other hand he will perceive that the Lord became man; for `the Word,' he says, `became flesh, and dwelt among us[fn-67-P6760_2679920:227-nf] .'

For if it were so, and He only appeared in a man, it were nothing strange, nor had those who saw Him been startled, saying, Whence is He? and wherefore dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God? for they were familiar with the idea, from the words, `And the Word of the Lord came' to this or that of the Prophets[fn-67-P6762_2681426:229-nf] .

And does it not surpass all conceivable madness, to entertain the thought only, that God Himself counsels and considers and chooses and proceeds to have a good pleasure, that He be not without Word and without Wisdom, but have both? for He seems to be considering about Himself, who counsels about what is proper to His Essence. There being then much blasphemy in such a thought, it will be religious to say that things originate have come to be `by favour and will,' but the Son is not a work of will, nor has come after[fn-70-P7031_2796903:449-nf] , as the creation, but is by nature the own Offspring of God's Essence.

For when Christ was about to summon all nations to the illumination of the Faith, He chose those who were to devote themselves to the preaching of the Gospel not from among philosophers or orators,but took humble fishermen as the instruments by which He would reveal Himself, lest the heavenly teaching, which was of itself full of mighty power, should. seem to need the aid of words. And hence the Apostle protests and says, \"For Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the Gospel, not in wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made void; for the word of the cross is to them indeed that perish foolishness, but to those which are being saved it is the power of God.

See now here, though Moses be one, Moses himself speaks as if about another Moses, `as the Lord commanded Moses.' In like manner then, if the blessed Peter speak of the Divine Word also, as sent to the children of Israel by Jesus Christ, it is not necessary to understand that the Word is one and Christ another, but that they were one and the same by reason of the uniting which took place in His divine and loving condescension and becoming man. And even if He be considered in two ways[fn-72-P7265_2885242:137-nf] , still it is without any division of the Word, as when the inspired John says, `And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us[fn-72-P7266_2885395:138-nf] .'

For those who in this place separate the divine Word from the divine Incarnation, have, it seems, a degraded notion of the doctrine of His having become flesh, and entertain Gentile thoughts, as they do, conceiving that the divine Incarnation is an alteration of the Word.

If He is man, how can another's body speak in his heart? If God, then Christ is not a man but God; for since Christ spoke in the Apostle, and only God could speak in him, therefore a Divine Christ spoke in him. And so you see that there is nothing to be said here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and God: because complete Divinity was in Christ, and Christ was completely in God. No division or severing of the two can here be admitted. There is only one simple, pious, and sound confession to be made; viz., to adore, love, and worship Christ as God. But do you want to understand more fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God and Christ, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with Christ? Hear what the Apostle says to the Corinthians: \"For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.\"[fn-70-P7015_2541517:14-nf] But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he says: \"We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\"[fn-70-P7016_2541766:15-nf] You see then that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand then without any doubt that Christ is God; and when you see that the substance of God and Christ is altogether inseparable, admit also that the Person cannot be severed. Unless forsooth because the Apostle in one Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and in another before that of God, you invent two judgment seats, and fancy that some will be judged by Christ and others by God. But this is foolish and wild, and madder than a madman's utterances. Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the God of the universe, acknowledge the judgment seat of God in the judgment seat of Christ. Love life, love your salvation, love Him by whom you were created. Fear Him by whom you are to be judged. For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and laying aside wicked blasphemy and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you think that the judgment seat of God is different from that of Christ, you will come before the judgment seat of Christ, and will find by evidence that there is no gainsaying, that the judgment seat of God is indeed the same as that of Christ, and that in Christ the Son of God, there is all the glory of God the Son, and the power of God the Father. \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father.\"[fn-70-P7017_2543264:16-nf] For whoever denies the Father denies the Son also. \"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.\"[fn-70-P7018_2543444:17-nf] And so you should learn that the glory of the Father and the Son is inseparable, and their majesty is inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without the Father, nor the Father without the Son. But no man can honour God and the Son of God except in Christ the only-begotten Son of God. For it is impossible for a man to have the Spirit of God who is to be honoured except in the Spirit of Christ, as the Apostle says: \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. But if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.\"[fn-70-P7019_2544055:18-nf] And again: \"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose again.\"[fn-70-P7020_2544255:19-nf] You see then now, even against your will, that there is absolutely no difference between the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, or between the judgment of God and the judgment of Christ.

And savoring as these men always did of the earth, and ever hearing and answering according to the flesh, what did they say to Him? \"Who art thou?\" For when thou saidst, \"If ye believe not that I am,\" thou didst not tell us what thou wert. Who art thou, that we may believe? He answered \"The Beginning.\" Here is the existence that [always] is. The beginning cannot be changed: the beginning is self-abiding and all-originating; that is, the beginning, to which it has been said, \"But thou Thyself art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.\"[fn-16-P1653_1054622:13-nf] \"The beginning,\" He said, \"for so I also speak to you.\" Believe me [to be] the beginning, that ye may not die in your sins. For just as if by saying, \"Who art thou?\" they had said nothing else than this, What shall we believe thee to be? He replied, \"The beginning;\" that is, Believe me [to be] the \"beginning.\" For in the Greek expression we discern what we cannot in the Latin. For in Greek the word \"beginning\" (principium, arkh), is of the feminine gender, just as with us \"law\" (lex) is of the feminine gender, while it is of the masculine (nomoj) with them; or as \"wisdom\" (sapientia, sofia) is of the feminine gender with both. It is the custom of speech, therefore, in different languages to vary the gender of words, because in things themselves there is no place for the distinction of sex. For wisdom is not really female, since Christ is the Wisdom of God,[fn-16-P1654_1055509:14-nf] and Christ is termed of the masculine gender, wisdom of the feminine. When then the Jews said, \"Who art thou?\" He, who knew that there were some there who should yet believe, and therefore had said, Who art thou that so they might come to know what they ought to believe regarding Him, replied, \"The beginning:\" not as if He said, I am the beginning; but as if He said, Believe me [to he] the beginning. Which, as I said, is quite evident in the Greek language, where beginning (arkh) is of the feminine gender.[fn-16-P1655_1056040:15-nf] Just as if He had wished to say that He was the Truth, and to their question, \"Who art thou?\" had answered, Veritatem[fn-16-P1656_1056379:16-nf] [the Truth]; when to the words, \"Who art thou?\" He evidently ought to have replied, Veritas[fn-16-P1657_1056501:17-nf] [the Truth]; that is, I am the Truth. But His answer had a deeper meaning, when He saw that they had put the question, \"Who art thou?\" in such a way as to mean, Having heard from thee, \"If ye believe not that I am, what shall we believe thee to be? To this He replied, \"The beginning:\" as if He said, Believe me to be the beginning.

But be it so. As a baby, if it be so, you could not contradict and deny the Creed. Why did you hold your tongue when you were older and stronger. At any rate you grew up, and became a man, and were placed in the ministry of the Church. Through all these years, through all the steps of office and dignity, did you never understand the faith which you taught so long before? At any rate you knew that you were His deacon and priest. If the rule of salvation was a difficulty to you, why did you undertake the honour of that, of which you disliked the faith?

For discerning the time is one of the duties most urgent on us, for the practice of virtue; so that the blessed Paul, when instructing his disciple, teaches him to observe the time, saying, `Stand (ready) in season, and out of season[fn-87-P8794_3233945:2-nf] '-that knowing both the one and the other, be might do things befitting the season, and avoid the blame of unseasonableness.

And now when He saith, \"As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father,\" who can be ignorant of His meaning? For He knoweth the Father by Himself, and we by Him. That He hath knowledge by Himself, we know already: that we also have knowledge by Him, we have likewise learned, for this also we have learned of Him. For He Himself hath said: \"No one hath seen God at any time; but the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\"[fn-20-P2015_1248741:7-nf] And so by Him do we also get this knowledge, to whom He hath declared Him.

We were saying that by Christ we have a door of entrance to you; and why? Because we preach Christ. We preach Christ; and therefore we enter in by the door. But Christ preacheth Christ, for He preacheth Himself; and so the Shepherd entereth in by Himself. When the light shows the other things that are seen in the light, does it need some other means of being made visible itself? The light, then, exhibits both other things and itself. Whatever we understand, we understand with the intellect: and how, save by the intellect, do we understand the intellect itself? But does one in the same way with the bodily eye see both other things and [the eye] itself? For though men see with their eyes, yet their own eyes they see not. The eye of the flesh sees other things, itself it cannot [see]: but the intellect understands itself as well other things. In the same way as the intellect seeth itself, so also cloth Christ preach Himself. If He preacheth Himself, and by preaching entereth into thee, He entereth into thee by Himself. And He is the door to the Father, for there is no way of approach to the Father but by Him. \"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-20-P2017_1250362:9-nf] Many things are expressed by a word: all that I have just said, I have said, of course, by means of words. If I were wishing to speak also of a word itself, how could I do so but by the use of the word? And thus both many things are expressed by a word, which are not the same as the word, and the word itself can only be expressed by means of the word. By the Lord's help we have been copious in illustration. Remember, then, how the Lord Jesus Christ is both the door and the Shepherd: the door, in presenting Himself to view; the Shepherd, in entering in by Himself. And indeed, brethren, because He is the Shepherd, He hath given to His members to be so likewise. For both Peter, and Paul, and the other apostles were, as all good bishops are, shepherds. But none of us calleth himself the door. This-the way of entrance for the sheep-He has retained as exclusively belonging to Himself. In short, Paul discharged the office of a good shepherd when he preached Christ, because he entered by the door. But when the undisciplined sheep began to create schisms, and to set up other doors before them, not of entrance to their joint assembly, but for falling away into divisions, saying, some of them, \"I am of Paul;\" others, \"I am of Cephas;\" others,\" I of Apollos;\" others, \"I of Christ:\" terrified for those who said, \"I am of Paul,\"-as if calling out to the sheep, Wretched ones, whither are you going?

But let us give heed to the Lord, both in commanding and in offering His aid; in both telling us our duty, and assisting us to discharge it.

The former say: Why do we ask God not to let us be overcome by temptation, when it is all in our own power? The latter say: Why should we try to live well, when the power to do so is in the hands of God?

But He who is over all things, however much He commend Himself, cannot exalt Himself above His actual dignity: nor can God be rightly termed arrogant. For it is to our advantage to know Him, not to His; nor can any one know Him, unless that self-knowing One make Himself known. If He, then, by abstaining from self-commendation, wish, as it were, to avoid arrogance, He will deny us the power of knowing Him. And no one surely would blame Him for calling Himself Master, even though believing Him to be nothing more than a man; seeing He only makes profession of what even men themselves in the various arts profess to such an extent, without any charge of arrogance, that they are termed professors. But to call Himself also the Lord of His disciples,-of men who, in an earthly sense, were themselves also free-born,-who would tolerate it in a man? But it is God that speaks. Here no elation is possible to loftiness so great, no lie to the truth: the profit is ours to be the subjects of such loftiness, the servants of the truth. That He calls Himself Lord is no imperfection on His side, but a benefit on ours. The words of a certain profane[fn-24-P2469_1474147:2-nf] author are commended, when he says, \"All arrogance is hateful, and specially disagreeable is that of talent and eloquence;\"[fn-24-P2470_1474286:3-nf] and yet, when the same person was speaking of his own eloquence, he said, \"I would call it perfect, were I to pronounce judgment; nor, in truth, would I greatly fear the charge of arrogance.\"[fn-24-P2471_1474506:4-nf] If, then, that most eloquent man had in truth no fear of being charged with arrogance, how can the truth itself have such a fear? Let Him call Himself Lord who is the Lord, let Him say what is true who is the Truth; so that I may not fail to learn that which is profitable, by His being silent about that which is. The most blessed Paul-certainly not himself the only-begotten Son of God, but the servant and apostle of that Son; not the Truth, but a partaker of the truth-declares with freedom and consistency, \"And though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I say the truth.\"[fn-24-P2472_1475123:5-nf] For it would not be in himself, but in the truth, which is superior to himself, that he was glorying both humbly and truly: for it is he also who has given the charge, that he that glorieth should glory in the Lord.[fn-24-P2473_1475357:6-nf] Could thus the lover of wisdom have no fear of being chargeable with foolishness, though he desired to glory, and would wisdom itself, in its glorying, have any fear of such a charge? He had no fear of arrogance who said, \"My soul shall make her boast in the Lord;\"[fn-24-P2474_1475640:7-nf] and could the power of the Lord have any such fear in commending itself, in which His servant's soul is making her boast? \"Ye call me,\" He says, \"Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.\" Therefore ye say well, that I am so: for if I were not what ye say, ye would be wrong to say so, even with the purpose of praising me.

These are certainly four of what they call perturbations-fear and sorrow, love and gladness.

Let us, brethren, let us understand, and may the Lord enable us to understand, and enable us also to do what we understand. And if we know this, we know of a truth what the Lord doeth; for it is only the Lord that so enables us, and by such means only do we attain to His friendship. For just as there are two kinds of fear, which produce two classes of fearers; so there are two kinds of service, which produce two classes of servants. There is a fear, which perfect love casteth out;[fn-29-P2959_1690430:3-nf] and there is another fear, which is clean, and endureth for ever.[fn-29-P2960_1690514:4-nf] The fear that lies not in love, the apostle pointed to when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\"[fn-29-P2961_1690662:5-nf] But he referred to the clean fear when he said, \"Be not high-minded, but fear.\"[fn-29-P2962_1690760:6-nf] In that fear which love casteth out, there has also to be cast out the service along with it: for both were joined together by the apostle, that is, the service and the fear, when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\" And it was the servant connected with this kind of service that the Lord also had in His eye when He said, \"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.\" Certainly not the servant characterized by the clean fear, to whom it is said, \"Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy lord;\" but the servant who is characterized by the fear which love casteth out, of whom He elsewhere saith, \"The servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever.\"[fn-29-P2963_1691547:7-nf] Since, therefore, He hath given us power to become the sons of God,[fn-29-P2964_1691634:8-nf] let us not be servants, but sons: that, in some wonderful and indescribable but real way, we may as servants have the power not to be servants; servants, indeed, with that clean fear which distinguishes the servant that enters into the joy of his lord, but not servants with the fear that i has to be cast out, and which marketh him that abideth not in the house for ever. But let us bear in mind that it is the Lord that enableth us to serve so as not to be servants. And this it is that is unknown to the servant, who knoweth not what his Lord doeth; and who, when he doeth any good thing, is lifted up as if he did it himself, and not his Lord; and so, glories not in the Lord, but in himself, thereby deceiving himself, because glorying, as if he had not received.[fn-29-P2965_1692419:9-nf] But let us, beloved, in order that we may be the friends of the Lord, know what our Lord doeth. For it is He who makes us not only men, but also righteous, and not we ourselves. And who but He is the doer, in leading us to such a knowledge? For \"we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-29-P2966_1692829:10-nf] Whatever good there is, is freely given by Him.

Once more when in later years He was to be declared more openly and sought out the baptism of His forerunner John, was there any doubt of His being God remaining when after the baptism of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit in form of a dove descended and rested upon Him, and the Father's voice was heard from the skies, \"Thou art My beloved Son: in Thee I am well pleased[fn-8-P857_190664:4-nf] ?\" All these things we have alluded to with as much brevity as possible for this reason, that you may know, beloved, that though all the daysof Christ's life were hallowed by many mighty works of His[fn-8-P858_190885:5-nf] , and though in all His actions mysterious sacraments[fn-8-P859_191044:6-nf] shone forth, yet at one time intimations of events were given by signs, and at one time fulfilment realized: and that all the Saviour's works that are recorded are not suitable to the time of baptism. For if we were to commemorate with indiscriminate honour these things also which we know to have been done by the Lord after His baptism by the blessed John, His whole life- time would have to be observed in a continuous succession of festivals, because all His acts were full of miracles. But because the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge so instructed the Apostles and teachers of the whole Church as to allow nothing disordered or confused to exist in our Christian observances, we must discern the relative importance of the various solemnities and observe a reasonable distinction in all the institutions of our fathers and rulers: for we cannot otherwise \"be one flock and one shepherd[fn-8-P860_192227:7-nf] ,\" except as the Apostle teaches us, \"that we all speak the same thing: and that we be perfected in the same mind and in the same judgment[fn-8-P861_192384:8-nf] .\"","title":"Letter XVI.
