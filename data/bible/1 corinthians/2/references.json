Every affection is a heat: when, however, it is blown to (the flame of) affectation, forthwith, by the blaze of glory, it is an ardour. From this fuel, therefore, you see a great king[fn-2-P206_32743:52-nf] -inferior only to his glory-seething. He had conquered the Median race, and was conquered by Median garb. Doffing the triumphal mail, he degraded himself into the captive trousers! The breast dissculptured with scaly bosses, by covering it with a transparent texture he bared; punting still after the work of war, and (as it were) softening, he extinguished it with the ventilating silk! Not sufficiently swelling of spirit was the Macedonian, unless he had likewise found delight in a highly inflated garb: only that philosophers withal (I believe) themselves affect somewhat of that kind; for I hear that there has been (such a thing as) philosophizing in purple. If a philosopher (appears) in purple, why not in glided slippers[fn-2-P207_33490:53-nf] too? For a Tyrian[fn-2-P208_33543:54-nf] to be shod in anything but gold, is by no means consonant with Greek habits. Some one will say, \"Well, but there was another[fn-2-P209_33730:55-nf] who wore silk indeed, and shod himself in brazen sandals.\" Worthily, indeed, in order that at the bottom of his Bacchantian raiment he might make some tinkling sound, did he walk in cymbals! But if, at that moment, Diogenes had been barking from his tub, he would not (have trodden on him[fn-2-P210_34054:56-nf] ) with muddy feet-as the Platonic couches testify-but would have carried Empedocles down bodily to the secret recesses of the Cloacinae;[fn-2-P211_34258:57-nf] in order that he who had madly thought himself a celestial being might, as a god, salute first his sisters,[fn-2-P212_34678:58-nf] and afterwards men. Such garments, therefore, as alienate from nature and modesty, let it be allowed to be just to eye fixedly and point at with the finger and expose to ridicule by a nod. Just so, if a man were to wear a dainty robe trailing on the ground with Menander-like effeminacy, he would hear applied to himself that which the comedian says \"What sort of a cloak is that maniac wasting? \"For, now that the contracted brow of censorial vigilance is long since smoothed down, so far as reprehension is concerned, promiscuous usage offers to our gaze freedmen in equestrian garb, branded slaves in that of gentlemen, the notoriously infamous in that of the freeborn, clowns in that of city-folk, buffoons in that of lawyers, rustics in regimentals; the corpse-bearer, the pimp, the gladiator trainer, clothe themselves as you do. Turn, again, to women. You have to behold what Caecina Severus pressed upon the grove attention of the senate-matrons stoleless in public. In fact, the penalty inflicted by the decrees of the augur Lentulus upon any matron who had thus cashiered herself was the same as for fornication; inasmuch as certain matrons had sedulously promoted the disuse of garments which were the evidences and guardians of dignity, as being impediments to the practising of prostitution. But now, in their self-prostitution, in order that they may the more readily be approached, they have abjured stole, and chemise, and bonnet, and cap; yes, and even the very litters and sedans in which they used to be kept in privacy and secrecy even in public. But while one extinguishes her proper adornments, another blazes forth such as are not hers. Look at the street-walkers, the shambles of popular lusts; also at the female self-abusers with their sex; and, if it is better to withdraw your eyes from such shameful spectacles of publicly slaughtered chastity, yet do but look with eyes askance, (and) you will at once see (them to be) matrons! And, while the overseer of brothels airs her swelling silk, and consoles her neck-more impure than her haunt-with necklaces, and inserts in the armlets (which even matrons themselves would, of the guerdons bestowed upon brave men, without hesitation have appropriated) hands privy to all that is shameful, (while) she fits on her impure leg the pure white or pink shoe; why do you not stare at such garbs? or, again, at those which falsely plead religion as the supporter of their novelty? while for the sake of an all-white dress, and the distinction of a fillet, and the privilege of a helmet, some are initiated into (the mysteries of) Ceres; while, on account of an opposite hankering after sombre raiment, and a gloomy woollen covering upon the head, others run mad in Bellona's temple; while the attraction of surrounding themselves with a tunic more broadly striped with purple, and casting over their shoulders a cloak of Galatian scarlet, commends Saturn (to the affections of others). When this Mantle itself, arranged with more rigorous care, and sandals after the Greek model, serve to flatter Aesculapius,[fn-2-P213_37793:59-nf] how much more should you then accuse and assail it with your eyes, as being guilty of superstition-albeit superstition simple and unaffected? Certainly, when first it clothes this wisdom[fn-2-P214_38017:60-nf] which renounces superstitions with all their vanities, then most assuredly is the Mantle, above all the garments in which you array your gods and goddesses, an august robe; and, above all the caps and tufts of your Salii and Flamines, a sacerdotal attire. Lower your eyes, I advise you, (and) reverence the garb, on the one ground, meantime, (without waiting for others,) of being a renouncer of your error.","title":"I.

And on this account assuredly the happiness of the ancient ages was changed. For, having left God, the parent and founder of all things, men began to worship the senseless works[fn-11-P1118_501141:1-nf] of their own hands. And what were the effects of this corruption, or what evils it introduced, the subject itself sufficiently declares. For, turning away from the chief good, which is blessed and everlasting on this account, because it cannot be seen,[fn-11-P1119_501424:2-nf] or touched, or comprehended, and from the virtues which are in agreement with that good, and which are equally immortal, gliding down to these corrupt and frail gods, and devoting themselves to those things by which the body only is adorned, and nourished, and delighted, they sought eternal death for themselves, together with their gods and goods relating to the body, because all bodies are subject to death. Superstitions of this kind, therefore, were followed by injustice and impiety, as must necessarily be the case. For men ceased to raise their countenances to the heaven; but, their minds being depressed downwards, clung to goods of the earth, as they did to earth-born superstitions.There followed the disagreement of mankind, and fraud, and all wickedness; because, despising eternal and incorruptible goods, which alone ought to be desired by man, they rather chose temporal and short-lived things, and greater trust was placed by men in evil, inasmuch as they preferred vice to virtue, because it had presented itself as nearer at hand.[fn-11-P1120_502647:3-nf] ","title":"Book IV.

Of such persons I do not presume to speak rashly. I cannot tell whether there may not have been vouchsafed to the church some divine authority, proved by trustworthy evidences, for so honoring their memory: it may be that it is so. It may be they were not deceived by human judgment, but prompted by divine wisdom, to their act of self-destruction. We know that this was the case with Samson. And when God enjoins any act, and intimates by plain evidence that He has enjoined it, who will call obedience criminal? Who will accuse so religious a submission? But then every man is not justified in sacrificing his son to God, because Abraham was commendable in so doing. The soldier who has slain a man in obedience to the authority under which he is lawfully commissioned, is not accused of murder by any law of his state; nay, if he has not slain him, it is then he is accused of treason to the state, and of despising the law. But if he has been acting on his own authority, and at his own impulse, he has in this case incurred the crime of shedding human blood. And thus he is punished for doing without orders the very thing he is punished for neglecting to do when he has been ordered. If the commands of a general make so great a difference, shall the commands of God make none? He, then, who knows it is unlawful to kill himself, may nevertheless do so if he is ordered by Him whose commands we may not neglect. Only let him be very sure that the divine command has been signified. As for us, we can become privy to the secrets of conscience only in so far as these are disclosed to us, and so far only do we judge: \"No one knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.\"[fn-3-P348_118943:53-nf] But this we affirm, this we maintain, this we every way pronounce to be right, that no man ought to inflict on himself voluntary death, for this is to escape the ills of time by plunging into those of eternity; that no man ought to do so on account of another man's sins, for this were to escape a guilt which could not pollute him, by incurring great guilt of his own; that no man ought to do so on account of his own past sins, for he has all the more need of this life that these sins may be healed by repentance; that no man should put an end to this life to obtain that better life we look for after death, for those who die by their own hand have no better life after death.","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_09_book_v_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"ANF-05","text":"These are, he says, what are by all called the secret mysteries, \"which (also we speak), not in words taught of human wisdom, but in those taught of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

For this Jerusalem is Sophia, she (that is) outside (the Pleroma), and her spouse is the \"Joint Fruit of the Pleroma.\" And the Demiurge projected souls; for this (Sophia) is the essence of souls. This (Demiurge), according to them, is Abraham, and these (souls) the children of Abraham. From the material and divilish essence the Demiurge fashioned bodies for the souls. This is what has been declared: \"And God formed man, taking clay from the earth, and breathed upon his face the breath of life, and man was made into a living soul.\"[fn-15-P1598_476071:88-nf] This, according to them, is the inner man, the natural (man), residing in the material body: Now a material (man) is perishable, incomplete, (and) formed out of the devilish essence. And this is the material man, as it were, according to them an inn,[fn-15-P1599_476340:89-nf] or domicile, at one time of soul only, at another time of soul and demons, at another time of soul and Logoi.[fn-16-P1600_476484:90-nf] And these are the Logoi that have been dispersed from above, from the \"Joint Fruit of the Pleroma\" and (from) Sophia, into this world.

Hence also the sevenfold operation of the Holy Ghost, of which Isaiah speaks,[fn-2-P265_50304:30-nf] seems to me to correspond to these stages and sentences. But there is a difference of order: for there the enumeration begins with the more excellent, but here with the inferior.

Piety[fn-2-P267_51073:32-nf] corresponds to the meek: for he who inquires piously honours Holy Scripture, and does not censure what he does not yet understand, and on this account does not offer resistance; and this is to be meek: whence it is here said, \"Blessed are the meek.\" Knowledge corresponds to those that mourn who already have found out in the Scriptures by what evils they are held chained which they ignorantly have coveted as though they were good and useful. Fortitude corresponds to those hungering and thirsting: for they labour in earnestly desiring joy from things that are truly good, and in eagerly seeking to turn away their love from earthly and corporeal things: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst afterrighteousness.\" Counsel corresponds to the merciful: for this is the one remedy for escaping from so great evils, that we forgive, as we wish to be ourselves forgiven; and that we assist others so far as we are able, as we ourselves desire to be assisted where we are not able: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are the merciful.\" Understanding corresponds to the pure in heart, the eye being as it were purged, by which that may be beheld which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and what hath not entered into the heart of man:[fn-2-P268_52468:33-nf] and of them it is here said,\" Blessed are the pure in heart.\" Wisdom corresponds to the peacemakers, in whom all things are now brought into order, and no passion is in a state of rebellion against reason, but all things together obey the spirit of man, while he himself also obeys God: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\"[fn-2-P269_52851:34-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_07_book_i_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"53.

The same Mark brings before us the Saviour thus addressing the Pharisees: \"Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was an hungred, he and they that were with him, how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the highpriest, and did eat the shew-bread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests?\"[fn-23-P2380_608094:1699-nf] Now let us turn to the books of Samuel, or, as they are commonly called, of Kings, and we shall find there that the highpriest's name was not Abiathar but Ahimelech,[fn-23-P2381_608295:1700-nf] the same that was afterwards put to death with the rest of the priests by Doeg at the command of Saul.[fn-23-P2382_608422:1701-nf] Let us pass on now to the apostle Paul who writes thus to the Corinthians: \"For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written, Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"[fn-23-P2383_608759:1702-nf] Some writers on this passage betake themselves to the ravings of the apocryphal books and assert that the quotation comes from the Revelation of Elijah;[fn-23-P2384_608949:1703-nf] whereas the truth is that it is found in Isaiah according to the Hebrew text: \"Since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee what thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.\"[fn-23-P2385_609298:1704-nf] The Septuagint has rendered the words quite differently: \"Since the beginning of the world we have not heard, neither have our eyes seen any God beside thee and thy true works, and thou wilt shew mercy to them that wait for thee.\" We see then from what place the quotation is taken and yet the apostle has not rendered his original word for word, but, using a paraphrase, he has given the sense in different terms. In his epistle to the Romans the same apostle quotes these words from Isaiah: \"Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and rock of offence,\"[fn-23-P2386_609945:1705-nf] a rendering which is at variance with the Greek version[fn-23-P2387_610023:1706-nf] yet agrees with the original Hebrew. The Septuagint gives an opposite meaning, \"that you fall not on a stumblingstone nor on a rock of offence.\" The apostle Peter agrees with Paul and the Hebrew, writing: \"but to them that do not believe, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.\"[fn-23-P2388_610347:1707-nf] From all these passages it is clear that the apostles and evangelists in translating the old testament scriptures have sought to give the meaning rather than the words, and that they have not greatly cared to preserve forms or constructions, so long as they could make clear the subject to the understanding.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1126","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"31.

For that this is really so, any one may perceive in reference to my brother and fellow-prelate Athanasius, whom God has restored to you, both on account of his purity of life, and in answer to your prayers. From this it is evident that your supplications to God have unceasingly been offered pure and abounding with love; for mindful of the divine promises and of the charity connected with them, which ye learned from the instruction of my brother, ye knew assuredly, and according to the sound faith which is in you clearly foresaw that your bishop would not be separated from you for ever, whom ye had in your devout hearts as though he were ever present. Wherefore it is unnecessary for me to use many words in addressing you, for your faith has already anticipated whatever I could have said; and the common prayer of you all has been fulfilled according to the grace of Christ. I therefore rejoice with you, and repeat that ye have preserved your souls invincible in the faith. And with my brother Athanasius I rejoice equally; because, while suffering many afflictions, he has never been unmindful of your love and desire; for although he seemed to be withdrawn from you in, person for a season, yet was he always present with you in spirit. Moreover, I am convinced, beloved, that every trial which he has endured has not been inglorious; since both your faith and his has thus been tested and made manifest to all. But had not so many troubles happened to him, who would have believed, either that you had so great esteem and love for this eminent prelate, or that he was endowed with such distinguished virtues, on account of which also he will by no means be defrauded of his hope in the heavens? He has accordingly obtained a testimony of confession in every way glorious both in the present age and in that which is to come. For having suffered so many and diversified trials both by land and by sea, he has trampled on every machination of the Arian heresy; and though often exposed to danger in consequence of envy, he despised death, being protected by Almighty God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, ever trusting that he should not only escape the plots [of his adversaries], but also be restored for your consolation, and bring back to you at the same time greater trophies from your own conscience. By which means he has been made known even to the ends of the whole earth as glorious, his worth having been approved by the purity of his life, the firmness of his purpose, and his steadfastness in the heavenly doctrine, all being attested by your unchanging esteem and love. He therefore returns to you, more illustrious now than when he departed from you. For if the fire tries the precious metals (I speak of gold and silver) for purification, what can be said of so excellent a man proportionate to his worth, who after having overcome the fire of so many calamities and dangers, is now restored to you, being declared innocent not only by us, but also by the whole Synod? Receive therefore with godly honor and joy, beloved brethren, your bishop Athanasius, together with those who have been his companions in tribulation. And rejoice in having attained the object of your prayers, you who have supplied with meat and drink, by your supporting letters, your pastor hungering and thirsting, so to speak, for your spiritual welfare. And in fact ye were a comfort to him while he was sojourning in a strange land; and ye cherished him in your most faithful affections when he was plotted against and persecuted. As for me, it makes me happy even to picture to myself in imagination the delight of each one of you at his return, the pious greetings of the populace, the glorious festivity of those assembled to meet him, and indeed what the entire aspect of that day will be when my brother shall be brought back to you again; when past troubles will be at an end, and his prized and longed-for return will unite all hearts in the warmest expression of joy. This feeling will in a very high degree extend to us, who regard it as a token of divine favor that we should have been privileged to become acquainted with so eminent a person. It becomes us therefore to close this epistle with prayer. May God Almighty and his Son our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ afford you this grace continually, thus rewarding the admirable faith which ye have manifested in reference to your bishop by an illustrious testimony: that the things most excellent which `Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man; even the things which God has prepared for them that love him,'[fn-7-P737_308318:71-nf] may await you and yours in the world to come, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom be glory to God Almighty for ever and ever, Amen.

The dispensation of our God and Saviour concerning man is a recall from the fall and a return from the alienation caused by disobedience to close communion with God. This is the mason for the sojourn of Christ in the flesh, the pattern life described in the Gospels, the sufferings, the cross, the tomb, the resurrection; so that the man who is being saved through imitation of Christ receives that old adoption. For perfection of life the imitation of Christ is necessary, not only in the example of gentleness,[fn-15-P1524_371731:298-nf] lowliness, and long suffering set us in His life, but also of His actual death. So Paul, the imitator of Christ,[fn-15-P1525_371865:299-nf] says, \"being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1526_372254:300-nf] How then are we made in the likeness of His death?[fn-15-P1527_372330:301-nf] In that we were buried[fn-15-P1528_372379:302-nf] with Him by baptism. What then is the manner of the burial? And what is the advantage resulting from the imitation? First of all, it is necessary that the continuity of the old life be cut. And this is impossible less a man be born again, according to the Lord's word;[fn-15-P1529_372670:303-nf] for the regeneration, as indeed the name shews, is a beginning of a second life. So before beginning the second, it is necessary to put an end to the first. For just as in the case of runners who turn and take the second course,[fn-15-P1530_372956:304-nf] a kind of halt and pause intervenes between the movements in the opposite direction, so also inmaking a change in lives it seemed necessary for death to come as mediator between the two, ending all that goes before, and beginning all that comes after. How then do we achieve the descent into hell? By imitating, through baptism, the burial of Christ. For the bodies of the baptized are, as it were, buried in the water. Baptism then symbolically signifies the putting off of the works of the flesh; as the apostle says, ye were \"circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism.\" And there is, as it were, a cleansing of the soul from the filth[fn-15-P1531_373733:305-nf] that has grown on it from the carnal mind,[fn-15-P1532_373982:306-nf] as it is written, \"Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\"[fn-15-P1533_374080:307-nf] On this account we do not, as is the fashion of the Jews, wash ourselves at each defilement, but own the baptism of salvation[fn-15-P1534_374233:308-nf] to be one.[fn-15-P1535_374337:309-nf] For there the death on behalf of the world is one, and one the resurrection of the dead, whereof baptism is a type. For this cause the Lord, who is the Dispenser of our life, gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a type of life and death, for the water fulfils the image of death, and the Spirit gives us the earnest of life. Hence it follows that the answer to our question why the water was associated with the Spirit[fn-15-P1536_374781:310-nf] is clear: the reason is because in baptism two ends were proposed; on the one hand, the destroying of the body of sin,[fn-15-P1537_374927:311-nf] that it may never bear fruit unto death;[fn-15-P1538_374991:312-nf] on the other hand, our living unto the Spirit,[fn-15-P1539_375062:313-nf] and having our fruit in holiness;[fn-15-P1540_375119:314-nf] the water receiving the body as in a tomb figures death, while the Spirit pours in the quickening power, renewing our souls from the deadness of sin unto their original life. This then is what it is to be born again of water and of the Spirit, the being made dead being effected in the water, while our life is wrought in us through the Spirit. In three immersions,[fn-15-P1541_375509:315-nf] then, and with three invocations, the great mystery of baptism is performed, to the end that the type of death may be fully figured, and that by the tradition of the divine knowledge the baptized may have their souls enlightened. It follows that if there is any grace in the water, it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence of the Spirit. For baptism is \"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God.\"[fn-15-P1542_376000:316-nf] So in training us for the life that follows on the resurrection the Lord sets out all the manner of life required by the Gospel, laying down for us the law of gentleness, of endurance of wrong, of freedom from the defilement that comes of the love of pleasure, and from covetousness, to the end that we may of set purpose win beforehand and achieve all that the life to come of its inherent nature possesses. If therefore any one in attempting a definition were to describe the gospel as a forecast of the life that follows on the resurrection, he would not seem to me to go beyond what is meet and right. Let us now return to our main topic.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"38.

But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures whom we cannot name.[fn-15-P1559_383788:327-nf] And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover, the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me either to affirm that there are three original hypostases[fn-15-P1560_384325:328-nf] or to allege the operation of the Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the Son and perfecting through the Spirit.[fn-15-P1561_384514:329-nf] The operation of the Father who worketh all in all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son, but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the Spirit. \"For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.\"[fn-15-P1562_385080:330-nf] The Word then is not a mere significant impression on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who \"was with God in the beginning\" and \"was God,\"[fn-15-P1563_385462:331-nf] and the Spirit of the mouth of God is \"the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-15-P1564_385668:332-nf] You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the Word who creates,and the Spirit who confirms.[fn-15-P1565_385807:333-nf] And what other thing could confirmation be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfectingexpresses the confirmation's firmness,unchangeableness,and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial fire, as it is written, \"Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;\"[fn-15-P1566_386607:334-nf] wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance, superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and distinctness. For how are angels to cry \"Glory to God in the highest\"[fn-15-P1567_387331:335-nf] without being empowered by the Spirit? For \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;\"[fn-15-P1568_387931:336-nf] as might be said by wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice, and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel[fn-15-P1569_388251:337-nf] in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires[fn-15-P1570_388533:338-nf] derive the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit? The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1571_388790:339-nf] And how could \"thrones, dominions, principalities and powers\"[fn-15-P1572_388871:340-nf] live their blessed life, did they not \"behold the face of the Father which is in heaven\"?[fn-15-P1573_389017:341-nf] But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night, if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive, and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without the guidance of the coryphaeus. How could the Seraphim cry\"Holy, Holy, Holy,\"[fn-15-P1574_389650:342-nf] were they not taught by the Spirit how often true religion requires them to lift their voice in this ascription of glory? Do \"all His angels\" and \"all His hosts\"[fn-15-P1575_389831:343-nf] praise God? It is through the co-operation of the Spirit. Do \"thousand thousand\" of angels stand before Him, and\"ten thousand times ten thouSand\" ministering spirits?[fn-15-P1576_390022:344-nf] They are blamelessly doing their proper work by the power of the Spirit. All the glorious and unspeakable harmony[fn-15-P1577_390154:345-nf] of the highest heavens both in the service of God, and in the mutual concord of the celestial powers, can therefore only be preserved by the direction of the Spirit. Thus with those beings who are not gradually perfected by increase and advance,[fn-15-P1578_390423:346-nf] butare perfect from the moment of the creation, there is in creation the presence of the Holy Spirit, who confers on them the grace that flows from Him for the completion and perfection of their essence.[fn-15-P1579_390648:347-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"41. What, however, they call sub-numeration,[fn-16-P1609_398078:370-nf] and in what sense they use this word, cannot even be imagined without difficulty. It is well known that it was imported into our language from the\"wisdom of the world;\"[fn-16-P1610_398274:371-nf] but a point for our present consideration will be whether it has any immediate relation to the subject under discussion. Those who are adepts in vain investigations tell us that, while some nouns are common and of widely extended denotation, others are more specific, and that the force of some is more limited than that of others. Essence, for instance, is a common noun, predicable of all things both animate and inanimate; while animal is more specific, being predicated of fewer subjects than the former, though of more than those which are considered under it, as it embraces both rational and irrational nature. Again, human is more specific than animal, and man than human, and than man the individual Peter, Paul or John.[fn-16-P1611_399026:372-nf] Do they then mean by sub-numerationthe division of the common into its subordinate parts? But I should hesitate to believe they have reached such a pitch of infatuation as to assert that the God of the universe, like some common quality conceivable only by reason and without actual existence in any hypostasis, is divided into subordinate divisions, and that then this subdivision is called sub-numeration. This would hardly be said even by men melancholy mad, for, besides its impiety, they are establishing the very opposite argument to their own contention. For the subdivisions are of the same essence as that from which they have been divided. The very obviousness of the absurdity makes it difficult for us to find arguments to confute their unreasonableness; so that really their folly looks like an advantage to them; just as soft and yielding bodies offer no resistance, and therefore cannot be struck a stout blow. It is impossible to bring a vigorous confutation to bear on a palpable absurdity. The only course open to us is topass by their abominable impiety in silence. Yet our love for the brethren and the importunity of our opponents makes silence impossible.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"147","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"51. HE is not a slave, it is said; not a master, but free. Oh the terrible insensibility, the pitiable audacity, of them that maintain this! Shall I rather lament in them their ignorance or their blasphemy? They try to insult the doctrines that concern the divine nature[fn-17-P1701_433367:443-nf] by comparing them with the human, and endeavour to apply to the ineffable nature of God that common custom of human life whereby the difference of degrees is variable, not perceiving that among men no one is a slave by nature. For men are either brought under a yoke of slavery by conquest, as when prisoners are taken in war; or they are enslaved on account of poverty, as the Egyptians were oppressed by Pharaoh; or, by a wise and mysterious dispensation, the worst children are by their fathers' order condemned to serve the wiser and the better;[fn-17-P1702_433937:444-nf] and this any righteous enquirer into the circumstances would declare to be not a sentence of condemnation but a benefit. For it is more profitable that the man who, through lack of intelligence, has no natural principle of rule within himself, should become the chattel of another, to the end that, being guided by the reason of his master, he may be like a chariot with a charioteer, or a boat with a steersman seated at the tiller. For this reason Jacob by his father's blessing became lord of Esau,[fn-17-P1703_434461:445-nf] in order that the foolish son, who had not intelligence, his proper guardian, might, even though he wished it not, be benefited by his prudent brother. So Canaan shall be \"a servant unto his brethren\"[fn-17-P1704_434717:446-nf] because, since his father Ham was unwise, he was uninstructed in virtue. In this world, then, it is thus that men are made slaves, but they who have escaped poverty or war, or do not require the tutelage of others, are free. It follows that even though one man be called master and another servant, nevertheless, both in view of our mutual equality of rank and as chattels of our Creator, we are all fellow slaves. But in that other world what can yon bring out of bondage? For no sooner were they created than bondage was commenced. The heavenly bodies exercise no rule over one another, for they are unmoved by ambition, but all bow down to God, and render to Him alike the awe which is due to Him as Master and the glower which fails to Him as Creator. For \"a son honoureth his father and a servant his master,\"[fn-17-P1705_435556:447-nf] and from all God asks one of these two things; for \"if I then be a Father where is my honour? and if I be a Master where is my fear?\"[fn-17-P1706_435713:448-nf] Otherwise the life of all men, if it were not under the oversight of a master, would be most pitiable; as is the condition of the apostate powers who, because they stiffen their neck against God Almighty, fling off the reins of their bondage,-not that their natural constitution is different; but the cause is in their disobedient disposition to their Creator. Whom then do you call free? Him who has no King? Him who has neither power to rule another nor willingness to be ruled? Among all existent beings no such nature is to be found. To entertain such a conception of the Spirit is obvious blasphemy. If He is a creature of course He serves with all the rest, for \"all things,\" it is said \"are thy servants,\"[fn-17-P1707_436446:449-nf] but if He is above Creation, then He shares in royalty.[fn-17-P1708_436520:450-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"161","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"56. Let us then examine the points one by one. He is good by nature, in the same way as the Father is good, and the Son is good; the creature on the other hand shares in goodness by choosing the good. He knows \"The deep things of God;\"[fn-17-P1771_456231:495-nf] the creature receives the manifestation of ineffable things through the Spirit. He quickens together with God, who produces and preserves all things alive,[fn-17-P1772_456411:496-nf] and together with the Son, who gives life. \"He that raised up Christ from the dead,\" it is said, \"shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you;\"[fn-17-P1773_456701:497-nf] and again \"my sheep hear my voice, ... and I give unto them eternal life;\"[fn-17-P1774_456802:498-nf] but Spirit\" also, it is said, \"giveth life,\"[fn-17-P1775_457377:499-nf] and again \"the Spirit,\" it is said, \"is life, because of righteousness.\"[fn-17-P1776_457472:500-nf] And the Lord bears witness that \"it is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.\"[fn-17-P1777_457591:501-nf] How then shall we alienate the Spirit from His quickening power, and make Him belong to lifeless nature? Who is so contentious, who is so utterly without the heavenly gift,[fn-17-P1778_457786:502-nf] and unfed by God's good words, who is so devoid of part and lot in eternal hopes, as to sever the Spirit from the Godhead and rank Him with the creature?","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"165","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"58. IT is, however, asked by our opponents, how it is that Scripture nowhere describes the Spirit as glorified together with the Father and the Son, but carefully avoids the use of the expression \"with the Spirit,\" while it everywhere prefers to ascribe glory \"in Him\" as being the fitter phrase. I should, for my own part, deny that the word in [or by] implies lower dignity than the word \"with;\" I should main-pain on the contrary that, rightly understood, it leads us up to the highest possible meaning. This is the case where, as we have observed, it often stands instead of with; as for instance, \"I will go into thy house in burnt offerings,\"[fn-17-P1789_460087:508-nf] instead of with burnt offerings and\"he brought them forth also by silver and gold,\"[fn-17-P1790_460193:509-nf] that is to say with silver and gold and \"thou goest not forth in our armies\"[fn-17-P1791_460289:510-nf] instead of with our armies, and innumerable similar passages. In short I should very much like to learn from this newfangled philosophy what kind of glory the Apostle ascribed by the word in, according to the interpretation which our opponents proffer as derived from Scripture, for I have nowhere found the formula \"To Thee, O Father, be honour and glory, through Thy only begotten Son, by [or in] the Holy Ghost,\"-a form which to our opponents comes, so to say, as naturally as the air they breathe. You may indeed find each of these clauses separately,[fn-17-P1792_460871:511-nf] but they will nowhere be able to show them to us arranged in this conjunction. If, then, they want exact conformity to what is written, let them give us exact references. If, on the other hand, they make concession to custom, they must not make us an exception to such a privilege.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"66.[fn-18-P1856_483019:561-nf] Of the beliefs and practices whether generally accepted or publicly enjoined which are preserved in the Church[fn-18-P1857_483150:562-nf] some we possess derived from written teaching; others we have received delivered to us \"in a mystery\"[fn-18-P1858_483474:563-nf] by the tradition of the apostles; and both of these in relation to true religion have the same force. And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"187","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"72. There is the famous Irenaeus,[fn-19-P1913_512764:606-nf] and Clement of Rome;[fn-19-P1914_512805:607-nf] Dionysius of Rome,[fn-19-P1915_513091:608-nf] and, strange to say, Dionysius of Alexandria, in his second Letter to his namesake, on \"Conviction and Defence,\" so concludes. I will give you his very words. \"Following all these, we, too, since we have received from the presbyters who were before us a form and rule, offering thanksgiving in the same terms with them, thus conclude our Letter to you. To God the Father and the Son our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, glory and might for ever and ever; amen.\" And no one can say that this passage has been altered. He would not have so persistently stated that he had received a form and rule if he had said \"in the Spirit.\" For of this phrase the use is abundant: it was the use of \"with\" which required defence. Dionysius moreover in the middle of his treatise thus writes in opposition to the Sabellians, \"If by the hypostases being three they say that they are divided, there are three, though they like it not. Else let them destroy the divine Trinity altogether.\" And again: \"most divine on this account after the Unity is the Trinity.\"[fn-19-P1916_514160:609-nf] Clement, in more primitive fashion, writes, \"God lives, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-19-P1917_514278:610-nf] And now let us bear how Irenaeus, who lived near the times of the Apostles, mentions the Spirit in his work \"Against the Heresies.\"[fn-19-P1918_514424:611-nf] \"The Apostle rightly calls carnal them that are unbridled and carried away to their own desires, having no desire for the Holy Spirit,\"[fn-19-P1919_515132:612-nf] and in another passage Irenaeus says, \"The Apostle exclaimed that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of the heavens lest we, being without share in the divine Spirit, fall short of the kingdom of the heavens.\" If any one thinks Eusebius of Palestine[fn-19-P1920_515471:613-nf] worthy of credit on account of his wide experience, I point further to the very words he uses in discussing questions concerning the polygamy of the ancients. Stirring up himself to his work, he writes \"invoking the holy God of the Prophets, the Author of light, through our Saviour Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit.\"73. Origen, too, in many of his expositions of the Psalms, we find using the form of doxology \"with the Holy Ghost. The opinions which he held concerning the Spirit were not always and everywhere sound; nevertheless in many passages even he himself reverently recognises the force of established usage, and expresses himself concerning the Spirit in terms consistent with true religion. It is, if I am not mistaken, in the Sixth[fn-19-P1921_516605:614-nf] Book of his Commentary on the Gospel of St. John that he distinctly makes the Spirit an object of worship. His words are:-\"The washing or water is a symbol of the cleaning of the soul which is washed clean of all filth that comes of wickedness;[fn-19-P1922_516914:615-nf] but none the less is it also by itself, to him who yields himself to the God-head of the adorable Trinity, through the power of the invocations, the origin and source of blessings.\" And again, in his Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans \"the holy powers,\" he says\"are able to receive the Only-begotten, and the Godhead of the Holy Spirit.\" Thus I apprehend, the powerful influence of traditionfrequently impels men to express themselves in terms contradictory to their own opinions.[fn-19-P1923_517703:616-nf] Moreover this form of the doxology was not unknowneven to Africanus the historian. In the Fifth Book of his Epitome of the Times he says \"we who know the weight of those terms, and are not ignorant of the grace of faith, render thanks to the Father, who bestowed on us His own creatures, Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world and our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty with the Holy Ghost, for ever.\"[fn-19-P1924_518151:617-nf] The rest of the passages may peradventure be viewed with suspicion; or may really have been altered, and the fact of their having been tampered with will be difficult to detect because the difference consists in a single syllable. Those however which I have quoted at length are out of the reach of any dishonest manipulation, and can easily be verified from the actual works.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"194","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"77.

But when the attitude of our foes against us was changed from one of long standing and bitter strife to one of open warfare, then, as is well known, the war was split up in more ways than I can tell into many subdivisions, so that all men were stirred to a state of inveterate hatred alike by common party spirit and individual suspicion.[fn-19-P1950_533368:635-nf] But what storm at sea was ever so fierce and wild as this tempest of the Churches?

If a foeman is stricken and falls, his fellow soldier tramples him down. There is at least this bond of union between us that we hate our common foes, but no sooner have the enemy gone by than we find enemies in one another.

We see, as it were, whole churches, crews and all, dashed and shattered upon the sunken reefs of disingenuous heresy, while others of the enemies of the Spirit[fn-19-P1951_534398:636-nf] of Salvation have seized the helm and made shipwreck of the faith.[fn-19-P1952_534520:637-nf] And then the disturbances wrought by the princes of the world[fn-19-P1953_536883:638-nf] have caused the downfall of the people with a violence unmatched by that of hurricane or whirlwind. The luminaries of the world, which God set to give light to the souls of the people, have been driven from their homes, and a darkness verily gloomy and disheartening has settled on the Churches.[fn-19-P1954_537659:639-nf] The terror of universal ruin is already imminent, and yet their mutual rivalry is so unbounded as to blunt all sense of danger. Individual hatred is of more importance than the general and common warfare, for men by whom the immediate gratification of ambition is esteemed more highly than the rewards that await us in a time to come, prefer the glory of getting the better of their opponents to securing the common welfare of mankind. So all men alike, each as best he can, lift the hand of murder against one another. Harsh rises the cry of the combatants encountering one another in dispute; already all the Church is almost full of the inarticulate screams, the unintelligible noises, rising from the ceaseless agitations that divert the right rule of the doctrine of true religion, now in the direction of excess, now in that of defect. On the one hand are they who confound the Persons and are carried away into Judaism;[fn-19-P1955_538607:640-nf] on the other hand are they that, through the opposition of the natures, pass into heathenism.[fn-19-P1956_538722:641-nf] Between these opposite parties inspired Scripture is powerless to mediate; the traditions of the apostles cannot suggest terms of arbitration. Plain speaking is fatal to friendship, and disagreement in opinion all the ground that is wanted for a quarrel. No oaths of confederacy are so efficacious in keeping men true to sedition as their likeness in error. Every one is a theologue though he have his soul branded with more spots than can be counted. The result is that innovators find a plentiful supply of men ripe for faction, while self-appointed scions of the house of place-hunters[fn-19-P1957_539516:642-nf] reject the government[fn-19-P1958_540212:643-nf] of the Holy Spirit and divide the chief dignities of the Churches. The institutions of the Gospel have now everywhere been thrown into confusion by want of discipline; there is an indescribable pushing for the chief places while every self-advertiser tries to force himself into high office. The result of this lust for ordering is that our people are in a state of wild confusion for lack of being ordered;[fn-19-P1959_540889:644-nf] the exhortations of those in authority are rendered wholly purposeless and void, because there is not a man but, out of his ignorant impudence, thinks that it is just as much his duty to give orders to other people, as it is to obey any one else.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_10_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"When the Temple of Serapis was torn down and laid bare, there were found in it, engraven on stones, certain characters which they call hieroglyphics, having the forms of crosses.[fn-16-P1650_710358:65-nf] Both the Christians and pagans on seeing them, appropriated and applied them to their respective religions: for the Christians who affirm that the cross is the sign of Christ's saving passion, claimed this character as peculiarly theirs; but the pagans alleged that it might appertain to Christ and Serapis in common; `for,' said they, `it symbolizes one thing to Christians and another to heathens.'

Whereof you remember, beloved, that I have already spoken, when we were occupied with the words of the holy Gospel, where the Lord says, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" Not that in these words of the Lord we should be suspecting an over-fastidious concealment of no one knows what secrets, which might be uttered by the Teacher, but could not be borne by the learner, but those very things which in connection with religious doctrine we read and write, hear and speak of, as within the knowledge of such and such persons, were Christ willing to utter to us in the self-same way as He speaks of them to the holy angels, in His own Person as the only-begotten Word of the Father, and co-eternal with Him, where are the human beings that could bear them, even were they already spiritual, as the apostles still were not when the Lord so spoke to them, and as they afterwards became when the Holy Spirit descended? For, of course, whatever may be known of the creature, is less than the Creator Himself, who is the supreme and true and unchangeable God. And yet who keeps silence about Him? Where is His name not found in the mouths of readers, disputants, inquirers, respondents, adorers, singers, all sorts of haranguers, and lastly even of blasphemers themselves? And although no one keeps silence about Him, who is there that apprehends Him as He is to be understood, although He is never out of the mouths and the hearing of men? Who is there, whose keenness of mind can even get near Him? Who is there that would have known Him as the Trinity, had not He Himself desired so to become known? And what man is there that now holds his tongue about that Trinity; and yet what man is there that has any such idea of it as the angels? The very things, therefore, that are incessantly being uttered off-hand and openly about the eternity, the truth, the holiness of God, are understood well by some, and badly by others: nay rather, are understood by some, and not understood at all by others. For he that understands in a bad way, does not understand at all. And in the case even of those by whom they are understood in a right sense, by some they are perceived with less, by others with greater mental vividness, and by none on earth are apprehended as they are by the angels. In the very mind, therefore, that is to say, in the inner man, there is a kind of growth, not only in order to the transition from milk to solid food, but also to the taking of food itself in still larger and larger measure. But such growth is not in the way of a space-covering mass of matter, but in that of an illuminated understanding; because that food is itself the light of the understanding. In order, then, to your growth and apprehension of God, and in order that your apprehension may keep full pace with your ever-advancing growth, you ought to be addressing your prayer, and turning your hope, not to the teacher whose voice only reaches your ears, that is, who plants and waters only by outside labor, but to Him who giveth the increase.[fn-32-P3217_1796798:3-nf] ","title":"Tractate XCVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_102_tractate_xcvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5.

John, the most pious apostle, perceiving that the word `was' applied to the Word of God[fn-10-P1001_190644:34-nf] was far beyond and above the intelligence of created beings, did not presume to speak of His generation or creation, nor yet dared to name the Maker and the creature in equivalent syllables.

What the law of works enjoins by menace, that the law of faith secures by faith. The one says, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-14-P1416_692191:91-nf] the other says, \"When I perceived that nobody could be continent, except God gave it to him; and that this was the very point of wisdom, to know whose gift she was; I approached unto the Lord, and I besought Him.\"[fn-14-P1417_692422:92-nf] This indeed is the very wisdom which is called piety, in which is worshipped \"the Father of lights, from whom is every best giving and perfect gift.\"[fn-14-P1418_692594:93-nf] This worship, however, consists in the sacrifice of praise and giving of thanks, so that the worshipper of God boasts not in himself, but in Him.[fn-14-P1419_692757:94-nf] Accordingly, by the law of works, God says to us, Do what I command thee; but by the law of faith we say to God, Give me what Thou commandest. Now this is the reason why the law gives its command, - to admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that he to whom the command is given, if he is as yet unable to perform it, may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability, and complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the ability comes. \"For we have received not the spirit of this world,\" says again that most constant preacher of grace, \"but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-14-P1420_693454:95-nf] What, however, \"is the spirit of this world,\" but the spirit of pride? By it their foolish heart is darkened, who, although knowing God, glorified Him not as God, by giving Him thanks.[fn-14-P1421_693660:96-nf] Moreover, it is really by this same spirit that they too are deceived, who, while ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to God's righteousness.[fn-14-P1422_693890:97-nf] It appears to me, therefore, that he is much more \"a child of faith\" who has learned from what source to hope for what he has not yet, than he who attributes to himself whatever he has; although, no doubt, to both of these must be preferred the man who both has, and at the same time knows from whom he has it, if nevertheless he does not believe himself to be what he has not yet attained to. Let him not fall into the mistake of the Pharisee, who, while thanking God for what he possessed, yet failed to ask for any further gift, just as if he stood in, want of nothing for the increase or perfection of his righteousness.[fn-14-P1423_694531:98-nf] Now, having duly considered and weighed all these circumstances and testimonies, we conclude that a man is not justified by the precepts of a holy life, but by faith in Jesus Christ,-in a word, not by the law of works, but by the law of faith; not by the letter,but by the spirit; not by the merits of deeds, but by free grace.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_09_lecture_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"16.

And not only this, but also in their quantity and quality they excel present things to such an extent as never entered even the heart of man.[fn-6-P667_388726:49-nf] For at the present time like an infant in the womb, even so do we dwell in this world confined in a narrow space, and unable to behold the splendour and the freedom of the world to come: but when the time of travail arrives and the present life is delivered at the day of judgment of all men whom it has contained, those who have been miscarried go from darkness into darkness, and from affliction into more grievous affliction: but those which are perfectly formed and have preserved the marks of the royal image will be presented to the king, and will take upon themselves that service which angels and archangels minister to the God of all. I pray thee then, O friend, do not finally efface these marks, but speedily restore them, and stamp them more perfectly on thy soul. For corporeal beauty indeed God has confined within the limits of nature, but grace of soul is released from the constraint and bondage arising from that cause inasmuch as it is far superior to any bodily symmetry: and it depends entirely upon ourselves and the grace of God. For our Master, being merciful has in this special way honoured our race, that He has entrusted to the necessity of nature the inferior things which contribute nothing much to our advantage, and in their issue are matters of indifference, but of the things which are really noble He has caused us to be ourselves the artificers. For if He had placed corporeal beauty also under our control we should have been subjected to excessive anxiety, and should have wasted all our time upon things which are of no profit, and should have grievously neglected our soul.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_106_epistles_on_the_arian_heresy","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"ANF-06","text":"5.

When you think that you have judiciously harmonized the proportions of the hues, and believe yourself to have succeeded in skilfully giving vividness to their mutual combination; presently, when each body (of colour) and (the various) lights are fully developed, the convicted diversity will expose all the error. In the self-same darkness, accordingly, with regard to the parable of the two, sons also, they are led by some figures (occurring in it), which harmonize in hue with the present (state of things), to wander out of the path of the true light of that comparison which the subject-matter of the parable presents. For they set down, as represented in the two sons, two peoples-the eider the Jewish, the younger the Christian: for they cannot in the sequel arrange for the Christian sinner, in the person of the younger son, to obtain pardon, unless in the person of the eider they first portray the Jewish. Now, if I shall succeed in showing that the Jewish fails to suit the comparison of the elder son, the consequence of course will be, that the Christian will not be admissible (as represented) by the joint figure of the younger son. For although the Jew withal be called \"a son,\" and an \"elder one,\" inasmuch as he had priority in adoption;[fn-13-P1398_391415:89-nf] although, too, he envy the Christian the reconciliation of God the Father,-a point which the opposite side most eagerly catches at,-still it will be no speech of a Jew to the Father: \"Behold, in how many years do I serve Thee, and Thy precept have I never transgressed.\" For when has the Jew not been a transgressor of the law; hearing with the ear, and not hearing;[fn-13-P1399_391816:90-nf] holding in hatred him who reproveth in the gates,[fn-14-P1400_391889:91-nf] and in scorn holy speech?[fn-14-P1401_391941:92-nf] So, too, it will be no speech of the Father to the Jew: \"Thou art always with Me, and all Mine are thine.\" For the Jews are pronounced \"apostate sons, begotten indeed and raised on high, but who have not understood the Lord, and who have quite forsaken the Lord, and have provoked unto anger the Holy One of Israel.\"[fn-14-P1402_392284:93-nf] That all things, plainly, were conceded to the Jew, we shall admit; but he has likewise had every more savoury morsel torn from his throat,[fn-14-P1403_392448:94-nf] not to say the very land of paternal promise. And accordingly the Jew at the present day, no less than the younger son, having squandered God's substance, is a beggar in alien territory, serving even until now its princes, that is, the princes of this world.[fn-14-P1404_392768:95-nf] Seek, therefore, the Christians some other as their brother; for the Jew the parable does not admit. Much more aptly would they have matched the Christian with the elder, and the Jew with the younger son, \"according to the analogy of faith,\"[fn-14-P1405_393055:96-nf] if the order of each people as intimated from Rebecca's womb[fn-14-P1406_393140:97-nf] permitted the inversion: only that (in that case) the concluding paragraph would oppose them; for it will he fitting for the Christian to rejoice, and not to grieve, at the restoration of Israel, if it he true, (as it is), that the whole of our hope is intimately united with the remaining expectation of Israel.[fn-14-P1407_393497:98-nf] Thus, even if some (features in the parable) are favourable, yet by others of a contrary significance the thorough carrying out of this comparison is destroyed; although (albeit all points be capable of corresponding with mirror-like accuracy) there he one cardinal danger in interpretations-the danger lest the felicity of our comparisons be tempered with a different aim from that which the subject-matter of each particular parable has bidden us (temper it). For we remember (to have seen) actors withal, white accommodating allegorical gestures to their ditties, giving expression to such as are far different from the immediate plot, and scene, and character, and yet with the utmost congruity. But away with extraordinary ingenuity, for it has nothing to do with our subject. Thus heretics, too, apply the self-same parables where they list, and exclude them (in other cases)-not where they ought-with the utmost aptitude. Why the utmost aptitude? Because from the very beginning they have moulded together the very subject-matters of their doctrines in accordance with the opportune incidences of the parables. Loosed as they are from the constraints of the rule of truth, they have had leisure, of course, to search into and put together those things of which the parables seem (to be symbolical).","title":"VII.

It is therefore a further step if it is not expedient, (any more than reasonable), that the story of the prodigal son should apply to a Christian. Wherefore, if the image of a \"son\" is not entirely suitable to a Jew either, our interpretation shall be simply governed with an eye to the object the Lord had in view. The Lord had come, of course, to save that which \"had perished; \"[fn-14-P1419_400152:106-nf] \"a Physician.\" necessary to \"the sick\" \"more than to the whole.\"[fn-14-P1420_400245:107-nf] This fact He was in the habit both of typifying in parables and preaching in direct statements. Who among men \"perishes,\" who falls from health, but he who knows not the Lord? Who is \"safe and sound,\" but he who knows the Lord? These two classes-\"brothers\" by birth-this parable also will signify. See whether the heathen have in God the Father the \"substance\" of origin, and wisdom, and natural power of Godward recognition; by means of which power the apostle withal notes that \"in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom knew not God,\"[fn-14-P1421_400834:108-nf] -(wisdom) which, of course, it had received originally from God. This (\"substance\"), accordingly, he \"squandered; \"having been cast by his moral habits far from the Lord, amid the errors and allurements and appetites of the world,[fn-14-P1422_401086:109-nf] where, compelled by hunger after truth,[fn-14-P1423_401142:110-nf] he handed himself over to the prince of this age. He set him over \"swine,\" to feed that flock familiar to demons,[fn-14-P1424_401278:111-nf] where he would not be master of a supply of vital food, and at the same time would see others (engaged) in a divine work, having abundance of heavenly bread. He remembers his Father, God; he returns to Him when he has been satisfied; he receives again the pristine \"garment,\"-the condition, to wit, which Adam by transgression had lost. The \"ring\" also he is then Wont to receive for the first time, wherewith, after being interrogated,[fn-14-P1425_401779:112-nf] he publicly seals the agreement of faith, and thus thenceforward feeds upon the \"fatness\" of the Lord's body,-the Eucharist, to wit. This will be the prodigal son, who never in days bygone was thrifty; who was from the first prodigal, because not from the first a Christian. Him withal, returning from the world to the Father's embraces, the Pharisees mourned over, in the persons of the \"publicans and sinners.\" And accordingly to this point alone the elder brother's envy is adapted: not because the Jews were innocent, and obedient to God, but because they envied the nation salvation; being plainly they who ought to have been \"ever with\" the Father. And of course it is immediately over the first calling of the Christian that the Jew groans, not over his second restoration: for the former reflects its rap even upon the heathen; but the latter, which takes place in the churches, is not known even to the Jews. I think that I have advanced interpretations more consonant with the subject-matter of the parables, and the congruity of things, and the preservation of disciplines. But if the view with which the opposite party is eager to mould the ewe, and the drachma, and the voluptuousness of the son to the shape of the Christian sinner, is that they may endow adultery and fornication with (the gift of) repentance; it will be fitting either that all other crimes equally capital should be conceded remissible, or else that their peers, adultery and fornication, should be retained inconcessible.","title":"VII.

It is therefore a further step if it is not expedient, (any more than reasonable), that the story of the prodigal son should apply to a Christian. Wherefore, if the image of a \"son\" is not entirely suitable to a Jew either, our interpretation shall be simply governed with an eye to the object the Lord had in view. The Lord had come, of course, to save that which \"had perished; \"[fn-14-P1419_400152:106-nf] \"a Physician.\" necessary to \"the sick\" \"more than to the whole.\"[fn-14-P1420_400245:107-nf] This fact He was in the habit both of typifying in parables and preaching in direct statements. Who among men \"perishes,\" who falls from health, but he who knows not the Lord? Who is \"safe and sound,\" but he who knows the Lord? These two classes-\"brothers\" by birth-this parable also will signify. See whether the heathen have in God the Father the \"substance\" of origin, and wisdom, and natural power of Godward recognition; by means of which power the apostle withal notes that \"in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom knew not God,\"[fn-14-P1421_400834:108-nf] -(wisdom) which, of course, it had received originally from God. This (\"substance\"), accordingly, he \"squandered; \"having been cast by his moral habits far from the Lord, amid the errors and allurements and appetites of the world,[fn-14-P1422_401086:109-nf] where, compelled by hunger after truth,[fn-14-P1423_401142:110-nf] he handed himself over to the prince of this age. He set him over \"swine,\" to feed that flock familiar to demons,[fn-14-P1424_401278:111-nf] where he would not be master of a supply of vital food, and at the same time would see others (engaged) in a divine work, having abundance of heavenly bread. He remembers his Father, God; he returns to Him when he has been satisfied; he receives again the pristine \"garment,\"-the condition, to wit, which Adam by transgression had lost. The \"ring\" also he is then Wont to receive for the first time, wherewith, after being interrogated,[fn-14-P1425_401779:112-nf] he publicly seals the agreement of faith, and thus thenceforward feeds upon the \"fatness\" of the Lord's body,-the Eucharist, to wit. This will be the prodigal son, who never in days bygone was thrifty; who was from the first prodigal, because not from the first a Christian. Him withal, returning from the world to the Father's embraces, the Pharisees mourned over, in the persons of the \"publicans and sinners.\" And accordingly to this point alone the elder brother's envy is adapted: not because the Jews were innocent, and obedient to God, but because they envied the nation salvation; being plainly they who ought to have been \"ever with\" the Father. And of course it is immediately over the first calling of the Christian that the Jew groans, not over his second restoration: for the former reflects its rap even upon the heathen; but the latter, which takes place in the churches, is not known even to the Jews. I think that I have advanced interpretations more consonant with the subject-matter of the parables, and the congruity of things, and the preservation of disciplines. But if the view with which the opposite party is eager to mould the ewe, and the drachma, and the voluptuousness of the son to the shape of the Christian sinner, is that they may endow adultery and fornication with (the gift of) repentance; it will be fitting either that all other crimes equally capital should be conceded remissible, or else that their peers, adultery and fornication, should be retained inconcessible.","title":"VII.

For being himself empty, he gives empty answers to empty inquirers; for every answer is made to the emptiness of man. Some true words he does occasionally utter; for the devil fills him with his own spirit, in the hope that he may be able to overcome some of the righteous.

Try the man who has the Divine Spirit by his life. First, he who has the Divine Spirit proceeding from above is meek, and peaceable, and humble, and refrains from, all iniquity and the vain desire of this world, and contents himself with fewer wants than those of other men, and when asked he makes no reply; nor does he speak privately, nor when man wishes the spirit to speak does the Holy Spirit speak, but it speaks only when God wishes it to speak. When, then, a man having the Divine Spirit comes into an assembly of righteous men who have faith in the Divine Spirit, and this assembly of men offers up prayer to God, then the angel of the prophetic Spirit,[fn-6-P601_127690:3-nf] who is destined for him, fills the man; and the man being filled with the Holy Spirit, speaks to the multitude as the Lord wishes. Thus, then, will the Spirit of Divinity become manifest. Whatever power therefore comes from the Spirit of Divinity belongs to the Lord. Hear, then,\" says he, \"in regard to the spirit which is earthly, and empty, and powerless, and foolish. First, the man[fn-6-P602_128178:4-nf] who seems to have the Spirit exalts himself, and wishes to have the first seat, and is bold, and impudent, and talkative, and lives in the midst of many luxuries and many other delusions, and takes rewards for his prophecy; and if he does not receive rewards, he does not prophesy. Can, then, the Divine Spirit take rewards and prophesy? It is not possible that the prophet of God should do this, but prophets of this character are possessed by an earthly spirit. Then it never approaches an assembly of righteous men, but shuns them. And it associates with doubters and the vain, and prophesies to them in a comer, and deceives them, speaking to them, according to their desires, mere empty words: for they are empty to whom it gives its answers. For the empty vessel, when placed along with the empty, is not Crashed, but they correspond to each other. When, therefore, it comes into an assembly of righteous men who have a Spirit of Divinity, and they offer up prayer, that man is made empty, and the earthly spirit tees from him through fear, and that man is made dumb, and is entirely crashed, being unable to speak. For if you pack closely a storehouse with wine or oil, and put an empty jar in the midst of the vessels of wine or oil, you will find that jar empty as when you placed it, if you should wish to clear the storehouse. So also the empty prophets, when they come to the spirits of the righteous, are found [on leaving] to be such as they were when they came. This, then, is the mode of life of both prophets. Try by his deeds and his life the man who says that he is inspired. But as for you, trust the Spirit which comes from God, and has power; but the spirit which is earthly and empty trust not at all, for there is no power in it: it comes from the devil.

And, therefore, His garments are red and shining, because He is[fn-71-P7133_2354171:99-nf] beauteous in form more than the sons of men, and on account of the glory of His triumph they have been changed into a white robe; and then, in truth, as concerns Christ's flesh, were fulfilled the words,[fn-71-P7134_2354395:100-nf] \"Who is this that cometh up all in white, leaning upon her beloved?\" And that which is written in the same book:[fn-71-P7135_2354530:101-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy.\" These men are his true followers who have not[fn-71-P7136_2354629:102-nf] defiled their garments with women, for they have continued virgins, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. And so they shall be in white clothing. Then shall the saying of our Lord appear perfectly realised:[fn-71-P7137_2354887:103-nf] \"All that my Father has given me, I shall not lose aught thereof, but I will raise it up again at the last day;\" the whole of His humanity, forsooth, which He had taken upon Him in its entirety at His birth. Then shall the sheep which was[fn-71-P7138_2355146:104-nf] lost, and was wandering in the lower world, be carried whole on the Saviour's shoulders, and the sheep which was sick with sin shall be supported by the mercy of the Judge. Then shall they see him who pierced Him, who shouted,[fn-71-P7139_2355395:105-nf] \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Again and again shall they beat their breasts, they and their women, those women to whom our Lord said, as He carried His cross,[fn-71-P7140_2355572:106-nf] \"Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\" Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of the angels, who said to the stupefied Apostles,[fn-71-P7141_2355776:107-nf] \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking with astonishment into heaven? This Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" But what are we to think of a man saying that our Lord[fn-71-P7142_2356031:108-nf] ate with the Apostles for forty days after His resurrection in order that they might not think Him to be a phantom, and then asserting that it was a phantom which did this very thing, which ate and which was seen by many in the flesh. That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_16_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Observe again how he speaks covertly concerning Christ's power, showing that He raised Himself: just as in his first discourse he had said, \"Because it was not possible that He should be holden of it\" (ch. ii. 24), so here he says, \"And killed the Prince of Life.\" (v. 15.) It follows that the Life He had was not from another. The prince (or author) of evil would be he that first brought forth evil; the prince or author of murder, he who first originated murder; so also the Prince (or Author) of Life must be He Who has Life from Himself.[fn-5-P515_354190:10-nf] \"Whom God raised up,\" he continues: and now that he has uttered this, he adds, \"And his name, upon faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by Him hath given Him this perfect soundness. [The faith which is by Him h di autou pistij.] And[fn-5-P516_354892:11-nf] yet it was h eij autou pistij, \"the faith which is in Him\" (as its object) that did all. For the Apostles did not say, \"By the name,\" but, \"In the name,\" and it was in Him (eij autou) that the man believed. But they did not yet make bold to use the expression, \"The faith which is in Him.\" For, that the phrase \"By Him\" should not be too low, observe that after saying, \"Upon the faith of His name,\" he adds, \"His name hath made him strong,\" and then it is that he says, \"Yea, the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness.\" Observe how he implies, that in the kai ekeino former expression also \"Whom God raised up,\" he did but condescend to their low attainments. For that Person needed not Another's help for His rising again, Whose Name raised up a lame man, being all one as dead. Mark how on all occasions he adduces their own testimony. Thus above, he said, \"As ye yourselves also know;\" and, \"In the midst of you:\" and here again, \"Whom ye see and know: in the presence of you all.\" (ch. ii. 22.) And yet that it was, \"In His name,\" they knew not: but they did know that the man was lame, that he stands there whole.[fn-5-P517_356454:12-nf] They that had wrought the deed themselves confessed, that it was not by their own power, but by that of Christ. And had this assertion been unfounded, had they not been truly persuaded themselves that Christ had risen again, they would not have sought to establish the honor of a dead man instead of their own, especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them. Then, when their minds were alarmed, immediately he encourages them, by the appellation of Brethren, \"And now, brethren, I wot, etc.\" For in the former discourse he foretold[fn-5-P518_357361:13-nf] nothing, but only says concerning Christ, \"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly:\" here he adds an admonition. There he waited till the people spoke: here, he knew how much they had already effected, and that the present assembly was better disposed toward them. \"That through ignorance ye did it.\" And yet the circumstances mentioned above were not to be put to the score of ignorance. To choose the robber, to reject Him Who had been adjudged to be acquitted, to desire even to destroy Him-how should this be referred to ignorance? Nevertheless, he gives them liberty to deny it, and to change their mind about what had happened. \"Now this indeed, that you put to death the innocent, ye knew: but that you were killing \"the Prince of Life,\" this, belike, ye did not know.\" And he exculpated not them alone, but also the chief contrivers of the evil, \"ye and your rulers:\" for doubtless it would have roused their opposition, had he gone off into accusation. For the evil-doer, when you accuse him of some wickedness that he has done, in his endeavor to exonerate himself, grows more vehement. And he no longer says, \"Ye crucified,\" \"Ye killed,\" but, \"Ye did it;\" leading them to seek for pardon. If those rulers did it through ignorance, much more did these present.[fn-5-P519_358799:14-nf] \"But these things which God before had showed,\" etc. (v. 18.) But it is remarkable, that both in the first and in the second discourse, speaking to the same effect, that is, in the former, \"By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God;\" and in this, \"God before had showed that Christ should suffer;\" in neither does he adduce any particular text in proof. The fact is, that each one of such passages is accompanied with many accusations, and with mention of the punishment in store for them [as]; \"I will deliver up,\" says one, \"the wicked in requital for His grave, and the rich in return for His death.\" (Is. liii. 9.) And again, * * * \"Those things,\" he says, \"which God before had showed by the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer, He hath so fulfilled.\" It shows the greatness of that \"counsel,\"[fn-5-P520_360241:15-nf] in that all spoke of it, and not one only. It does not follow, because the event was through ignorance, that it took place irrespectively of God's ordinance. See how great is the Wisdom of God, when it uses the wickedness of others to bring about that which must be. \"He hath fulfilled,\" he says: that they may not imagine that anything at all is wanting; for whatsoever Christ must needs suffer, has been fulfilled. But do not think, that, because the Prophets said this, and because ye did it through ignorance, this sufficeth to your exculpation. However, he does not express himself thus, but in milder terms says, \"Repent ye therefore.\" (v. 19.) \"Why? For[fn-5-P521_361167:16-nf] either it was through ignorance, or by the dispensation of God.\" \"That your sins may be blotted out.\" I do not mean the crimes committed at the Crucifixion; perhaps they were through ignorance; but so that your other sins may be blotted out: this[fn-5-P522_361686:17-nf] only. \"So shall the times of refreshing come unto you.\" Here he speaks of the Resurrection, obscurely.[fn-5-P523_362008:18-nf] For those are indeed times of refreshing, which Paul also looked for, when he said, \"We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened.\" (2 Cor. v. 4.) Then to prove that Christ is the cause of the days of refreshing, he says, \"And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was for you ordained.\" (v. 20.) He said not, \"That your sin may be blotter out,\" but, \"your sins;\" for he hints at that sin also. \"He shall send.\" And whence?[fn-5-P524_362774:19-nf] \"Whom the heaven must receive.\" (v. 21.) Still [\"must\"] \"receive?\" And why not simply, Whom the heaven hath received? This, as if discoursing of old times: so, he says, it is divinely ordered, so it is settled: not a word yet of His eternal subsistence.-\" For Moses indeed said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord raise up for you:\" \"Him shall ye hear in all things that He shall speak unto you:\" and having said, \"All things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets,\" (v. 22) now indeed he brings in Christ Himself. For, if He predicted many things and it is necessary to hear Him, one would not be wrong in saying that the Prophets have spoken these things. But, besides, he wishes to show that the Prophets did predict the same things. And, if any one will look closely into the matter, he will find these things spoken in the Old Testament, obscurely indeed, but nevertheless spoken. \"Who was purposely designed,\" says he: in Whom[fn-5-P525_364901:20-nf] there is nothing novel. Here he also alarms them, by the thought that much remains to be fulfilled. But if so, how says he, \"Hath fulfilled?\" (v. 18.) The things which it was necessary \"that Christ should suffer,\" are fulfilled: the things which must come to pass, not yet. \"A prophet shall the Lord God raise up for you from among your brethren, like unto me.\" This would most conciliate them. Do you observe the sprinkling of low matters and high, side by side,-that He Who was to go up into the heavens should be like unto Moses? And yet it was a great thing too. For in fact He was not simply like unto Moses,[fn-5-P526_366140:21-nf] if so be that \"every soul which will not hear shall be destroyed.\" And one might mention numberless other things which show that He was not like unto Moses; so that it is a mighty text that he has handled. \"God shall raise Him up unto you,\" says Moses, \"from among your brethren,\" etc.: consequently Moses himself threatens those that should not hear. \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" etc.: all this[fn-5-P527_367034:22-nf] is calculated to attract \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" says the Apostle. \"from Samuel.\" He refrains from enumerating them singly, not to make his discourse too long; but having alleged that decisive testimony of Moses, he passes by the rest. \"Ye,\" he says, \"are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made.\" (v. 25) \"Children of the covenant;\" that is, heirs. For test they should think that they received this offer from the favor of Peter, he shows, that of old it was due to them, in order that they may the rather believe that such also is the will of God. \"Unto you first,\" he continues, \"God having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him.\" (v. 26.) He does not say simply, \"Unto you He sent His Son,\" but also, after the resurrection, and when He had been crucified. For that they may not suppose that he himself granted them this favor, and not the Father, he says, \"To bless you.\" For if He is your Brother, and blesses you, the affair is a promise. \"Unto you first.\" That is, so far are you from having no share in these blessings, that He would have you become moreover promoters and authors of them to others. For[fn-5-P528_368375:23-nf] you are not to feel like castaways. \"Having raised up\": again, the Resurrection. \"In turning away,\" he says, \"every one of you from his iniquities.\" In this way He blesses you: not in a general way. And what kind of blessing is this? A great one. For of course not the turning a man away from his iniquities is itself sufficient to remit them also. And if it is not sufficient to remit, how should it be to confer a blessing? For it is not to be supposed that the transgressor becomes forthwith also blessed; he is simply released from his sins. But this,[fn-5-P529_369195:24-nf] \"Like unto me,\" would no wise apply. \"Hear ye Him,\" he says; and not this alone, but he adds, \"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.\" When he has shown them that they had sinned, and has imparted forgiveness to them, and promised good things, then indeed, then he says, \"Moses also says the same thing.\" What sort of connection is this: \"Until the times of the restitution;\" and then to introduce Moses, saying, that[fn-5-P530_370379:25-nf] all that Christ said shall come to pass? Then also, on the other hand, he says, as matter of encomium (so that for this reason also ye ought to obey): \"Ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant:\" i.e. heirs. Then why do you stand affected towards that which is your own, as if it were another's? True, you have done deeds worthy of condemnation; still you may yet obtain pardon. Having said this, with reason he is now able to say, \"Unto you God sent his Son Jesus to bless you.\" He says not, To save you, but what is greater; that the crucified Jesus blessed His crucifiers.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_16_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Observe again how he speaks covertly concerning Christ's power, showing that He raised Himself: just as in his first discourse he had said, \"Because it was not possible that He should be holden of it\" (ch. ii. 24), so here he says, \"And killed the Prince of Life.\" (v. 15.)

[The faith which is by Him h di autou pistij.] And[fn-5-P516_354892:11-nf] yet it was h eij autou pistij, \"the faith which is in Him\" (as its object) that did all. For the Apostles did not say, \"By the name,\" but, \"In the name,\" and it was in Him (eij autou) that the man believed. But they did not yet make bold to use the expression, \"The faith which is in Him.\" For, that the phrase \"By Him\" should not be too low, observe that after saying, \"Upon the faith of His name,\" he adds, \"His name hath made him strong,\" and then it is that he says, \"Yea, the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness.\" Observe how he implies, that in the kai ekeino former expression also \"Whom God raised up,\" he did but condescend to their low attainments. For that Person needed not Another's help for His rising again, Whose Name raised up a lame man, being all one as dead. Mark how on all occasions he adduces their own testimony. Thus above, he said, \"As ye yourselves also know;\" and, \"In the midst of you:\" and here again, \"Whom ye see and know: in the presence of you all.\" (ch. ii. 22.) And yet that it was, \"In His name,\" they knew not: but they did know that the man was lame, that he stands there whole.[fn-5-P517_356454:12-nf] They that had wrought the deed themselves confessed, that it was not by their own power, but by that of Christ. And had this assertion been unfounded, had they not been truly persuaded themselves that Christ had risen again, they would not have sought to establish the honor of a dead man instead of their own, especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them. Then, when their minds were alarmed, immediately he encourages them, by the appellation of Brethren, \"And now, brethren, I wot, etc.\" For in the former discourse he foretold[fn-5-P518_357361:13-nf] nothing, but only says concerning Christ, \"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly:\" here he adds an admonition. There he waited till the people spoke: here, he knew how much they had already effected, and that the present assembly was better disposed toward them. \"That through ignorance ye did it.\" And yet the circumstances mentioned above were not to be put to the score of ignorance. To choose the robber, to reject Him Who had been adjudged to be acquitted, to desire even to destroy Him-how should this be referred to ignorance? Nevertheless, he gives them liberty to deny it, and to change their mind about what had happened. \"Now this indeed, that you put to death the innocent, ye knew: but that you were killing \"the Prince of Life,\" this, belike, ye did not know.\" And he exculpated not them alone, but also the chief contrivers of the evil, \"ye and your rulers:\" for doubtless it would have roused their opposition, had he gone off into accusation. For the evil-doer, when you accuse him of some wickedness that he has done, in his endeavor to exonerate himself, grows more vehement. And he no longer says, \"Ye crucified,\" \"Ye killed,\" but, \"Ye did it;\" leading them to seek for pardon. If those rulers did it through ignorance, much more did these present.[fn-5-P519_358799:14-nf] \"But these things which God before had showed,\" etc. (v. 18.) But it is remarkable, that both in the first and in the second discourse, speaking to the same effect, that is, in the former, \"By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God;\" and in this, \"God before had showed that Christ should suffer;\" in neither does he adduce any particular text in proof. The fact is, that each one of such passages is accompanied with many accusations, and with mention of the punishment in store for them [as]; \"I will deliver up,\" says one, \"the wicked in requital for His grave, and the rich in return for His death.\" (Is. liii. 9.) And again, * * * \"Those things,\" he says, \"which God before had showed by the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer, He hath so fulfilled.\" It shows the greatness of that \"counsel,\"[fn-5-P520_360241:15-nf] in that all spoke of it, and not one only. It does not follow, because the event was through ignorance, that it took place irrespectively of God's ordinance. See how great is the Wisdom of God, when it uses the wickedness of others to bring about that which must be. \"He hath fulfilled,\" he says: that they may not imagine that anything at all is wanting; for whatsoever Christ must needs suffer, has been fulfilled. But do not think, that, because the Prophets said this, and because ye did it through ignorance, this sufficeth to your exculpation. However, he does not express himself thus, but in milder terms says, \"Repent ye therefore.\" (v. 19.) \"Why? For[fn-5-P521_361167:16-nf] either it was through ignorance, or by the dispensation of God.\" \"That your sins may be blotted out.\" I do not mean the crimes committed at the Crucifixion; perhaps they were through ignorance; but so that your other sins may be blotted out: this[fn-5-P522_361686:17-nf] only. \"So shall the times of refreshing come unto you.\" Here he speaks of the Resurrection, obscurely.[fn-5-P523_362008:18-nf] For those are indeed times of refreshing, which Paul also looked for, when he said, \"We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened.\" (2 Cor. v. 4.) Then to prove that Christ is the cause of the days of refreshing, he says, \"And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was for you ordained.\" (v. 20.) He said not, \"That your sin may be blotter out,\" but, \"your sins;\" for he hints at that sin also. \"He shall send.\" And whence?[fn-5-P524_362774:19-nf] \"Whom the heaven must receive.\" (v. 21.) Still [\"must\"] \"receive?\" And why not simply, Whom the heaven hath received? This, as if discoursing of old times: so, he says, it is divinely ordered, so it is settled: not a word yet of His eternal subsistence.-\" For Moses indeed said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord raise up for you:\" \"Him shall ye hear in all things that He shall speak unto you:\" and having said, \"All things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets,\" (v. 22) now indeed he brings in Christ Himself. For, if He predicted many things and it is necessary to hear Him, one would not be wrong in saying that the Prophets have spoken these things. But, besides, he wishes to show that the Prophets did predict the same things. And, if any one will look closely into the matter, he will find these things spoken in the Old Testament, obscurely indeed, but nevertheless spoken. \"Who was purposely designed,\" says he: in Whom[fn-5-P525_364901:20-nf] there is nothing novel. Here he also alarms them, by the thought that much remains to be fulfilled. But if so, how says he, \"Hath fulfilled?\" (v. 18.) The things which it was necessary \"that Christ should suffer,\" are fulfilled: the things which must come to pass, not yet. \"A prophet shall the Lord God raise up for you from among your brethren, like unto me.\" This would most conciliate them. Do you observe the sprinkling of low matters and high, side by side,-that He Who was to go up into the heavens should be like unto Moses? And yet it was a great thing too. For in fact He was not simply like unto Moses,[fn-5-P526_366140:21-nf] if so be that \"every soul which will not hear shall be destroyed.\" And one might mention numberless other things which show that He was not like unto Moses; so that it is a mighty text that he has handled. \"God shall raise Him up unto you,\" says Moses, \"from among your brethren,\" etc.: consequently Moses himself threatens those that should not hear. \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" etc.: all this[fn-5-P527_367034:22-nf] is calculated to attract \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" says the Apostle. \"from Samuel.\" He refrains from enumerating them singly, not to make his discourse too long; but having alleged that decisive testimony of Moses, he passes by the rest. \"Ye,\" he says, \"are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made.\" (v. 25) \"Children of the covenant;\" that is, heirs. For test they should think that they received this offer from the favor of Peter, he shows, that of old it was due to them, in order that they may the rather believe that such also is the will of God. \"Unto you first,\" he continues, \"God having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him.\" (v. 26.) He does not say simply, \"Unto you He sent His Son,\" but also, after the resurrection, and when He had been crucified. For that they may not suppose that he himself granted them this favor, and not the Father, he says, \"To bless you.\" For if He is your Brother, and blesses you, the affair is a promise. \"Unto you first.\" That is, so far are you from having no share in these blessings, that He would have you become moreover promoters and authors of them to others. For[fn-5-P528_368375:23-nf] you are not to feel like castaways. \"Having raised up\": again, the Resurrection. \"In turning away,\" he says, \"every one of you from his iniquities.\" In this way He blesses you: not in a general way. And what kind of blessing is this? A great one. For of course not the turning a man away from his iniquities is itself sufficient to remit them also. And if it is not sufficient to remit, how should it be to confer a blessing? For it is not to be supposed that the transgressor becomes forthwith also blessed; he is simply released from his sins. But this,[fn-5-P529_369195:24-nf] \"Like unto me,\" would no wise apply. \"Hear ye Him,\" he says; and not this alone, but he adds, \"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.\" When he has shown them that they had sinned, and has imparted forgiveness to them, and promised good things, then indeed, then he says, \"Moses also says the same thing.\" What sort of connection is this: \"Until the times of the restitution;\" and then to introduce Moses, saying, that[fn-5-P530_370379:25-nf] all that Christ said shall come to pass? Then also, on the other hand, he says, as matter of encomium (so that for this reason also ye ought to obey): \"Ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant:\" i.e. heirs. Then why do you stand affected towards that which is your own, as if it were another's? True, you have done deeds worthy of condemnation; still you may yet obtain pardon. Having said this, with reason he is now able to say, \"Unto you God sent his Son Jesus to bless you.\" He says not, To save you, but what is greater; that the crucified Jesus blessed His crucifiers.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_11_book_vii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The Gospel then came, says (Basilides), first from the Sonship through the Son, that was seated beside the Archon, to the Archon, and the Archon learned that He was not God of the universe, but was begotten. But (ascertaining that) He has above Himself the deposited treasure of that Ineffable and Unnameable (and) Non-existent One, and of the Sonship, He was both converted and filled with terror, when He was brought to understand in what ignorance He was (involved). This, he says, is what has been declared: \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"[fn-18-P1860_576226:45-nf] For, being orally instructed by Christ, who was seated near, he began to acquire wisdom, (inasmuch as he thereby) learns who is the Non-Existent One, what the Sonship (is), what the Holy Spirit (is), what the apparatus of the universe (is), and what is likely to be the consummation of things. This is the wisdom spoken in a mystery, concerning which, says (Basilides), Scripture uses the following expressions: \"Not in words taught of human wisdom, but in (those) taught of the Spirit.\"[fn-18-P1861_576731:46-nf] The Archon, then, being orally instructed, and taught, and being (thereby) filled with fear, proceeded to make confession concerning the sin which He had committed in magnifying Himself. This, he says, is what is declared: \"I have recognised my sin, and I know my transgression, (and) about this I shall confess for ever.\"[fn-18-P1862_577074:47-nf] When, then, the Great Archon had been orally instructed, and every creature of the Ogdoad had been orally instructed and taught, and (after) the mystery became known to the celestial (powers), it was also necessary that afterwards the Gospel should come to the Hebdomad, in order likewise that the Archon of the Hebdomad might be similarly instructed and indoctrinated into the Gospel. The Son of the Great Archon (therefore) kindled in the Son of the Archon of the Hebdomad the light which Himself possessed and had kindled from above from the Sonship. And the Son of the Archon of the Hebdomad had radiance imparted to Him, and He proclaimed the Gospel to the Archon of the Hebdomad. And in like manner, according to the previous account, He Himself was both terrified and induced to make confession. When, therefore, all (beings) in the Hebdomad had been likewise enlightened, and had the Gospel announced to them (for in these regions of the universe there exist, according to these heretics, creatures infinite (in number), viz., Principalities and Powers and Rulers, in regard of which there is extant among the (Basilidians)[fn-18-P1863_578227:48-nf] a very prolix and verbose treatise, where they allege that there are three hundred and sixty-five heavens, and that the great Archon of these is Abrasax,[fn-18-P1864_578493:49-nf] from the fact that his name comprises the computed number 365, so that, of course, the calculation of the title includes all (existing) things, and that for these reasons the year consists of so many days);-but when, he says, these (two events, viz., the illumination of the Hebdomad and the manifestation of the Gospel) had thus taken place, it was necessary, likewise, that afterwards the Formlessness existent in our quarter of creation should have radiance imparted to it, and that the mystery should be revealed to the Sonship, which had been left behind in Formlessness, just like an abortion.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_107_tractate_cii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. It remains, therefore, for us, so far as my capacity to apprehend it goes, to understand Jesus as having promised that He would cause His disciples, from being carnal and natural, to become spiritual, although not yet such as we shall be, when a spiritual body shall also be ours; but such as was he who said, \"We speak wisdom among them that are perfect;\"[fn-33-P3382_1873803:9-nf] and, \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal;\"[fn-33-P3383_1873895:10-nf] and, \"We have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural[fn-33-P3384_1874229:11-nf] man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.\" And thus the natural man, perceiving not the things of the Spirit of God, hears in such a way whatever is told him of the nature of God, that he can conceive of nothing else but some bodily form, however spacious or immense, however lustrous and magnificent, yet still a body: and therefore he holds as proverbs all that is said of the incorporeal and immutable substance of wisdom; not that he accounts them as proverbs, but that his thoughts follow the same direction as those who habitually listen to proverbs without understanding them. But when the spiritual man begins to discern all things, and he himself is discerned by no man, he perceives, even though in this life it still be through a glass and in part, not by any bodily sense, and not by any imaginative conception which catches at or devises the likenesses of all sorts of bodies, but by the clearest understanding of the mind, that God is not material, but spiritual: in such a way does the Son show us openly of the Father, that He, who thus shows, is also Himself seen to be of the same substance. And then it is that those who ask, ask in His name; for in the sound of that name they understand nothing else than what the reality is that is called by that name, and harbor not, in vanity or infirmity of mind, the fiction of the Father being in one place, and the Son in another, standing before the Father and making request in our behalf, with the material substances of both occupying each its own place, and the Word pleading verbally for us with Him whose Word He is, while a definite space interposes between the mouth of the speaker and the ears of the hearer; and other such absurdities which those who are natural, and at the same time carnal, fabricate for themselves in their hearts. For any such thing, suggested by the experience of bodily habits, as occurs to spiritual men when thinking of God, they deny and reject, and drive away, like troublesome insects, from the eyes of their mind; and resign themselves to the purity of that light by whose testimony and judgment they prove these bodily images that thrust themselves on their inward vision to be altogether false. These are able to a certain extent to think of our Lord Jesus Christ, in respect of His manhood, as addressing the Father on our behalf; but in respect to His Godhead, as hearing [and answering] us along with the Father. And this I am of opinion that He indicated, when He said, \"And I say not that I will pray the Father for you.\" But the intuitive perception of this, how it is that the Son asketh not the Father, but that Father and Son alike listen to those who ask, is a height that can be reached only by the spiritual eye of the mind.","title":"Tractate CII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"In enunciating this proposition of ours, then, that because some live according to the flesh and others according to the spirit, there have arisen two diverse and conflicting cities, we might equally well have said, \"because some live according to man, others according to God.\" For Paul says very plainly to the Corinthians, \"For whereas there is among you envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?\"[fn-23-P2317_1313802:17-nf] So that to walk according to man and to be carnal are the same; for by flesh, that is, by a part of man, man is meant. For before he said that those same persons were animal whom afterwards he calls carnal, saying, \"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might, know the things which are freely given to us of God.

For both the soul and the flesh, the component parts of man, can be used to signify the whole man; and so the animal man and the carnal man are not two different things, but one and the same thing, viz., man living according to man.

And he adds: \"But we received, not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are given to us by God, which we also speak, not in persuasive words of man's wisdom, but in manifestation of the Spirit and in the power of God.\"[fn-28-P2899_678088:185-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_16_book_v","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"\"This, then, is what the man has to say who substitutes,-for we may not speak of it as `application,' lest any one should blame for such madness men holy and chosen for the preaching of godliness, so as to reproach their doctrine with a fall into such extravagance,-who substitutes his own mind[fn-15-P1599_915508:18-nf] for the intention of the Apostles! With what confusion are they not filled, who refer their own nonsense to the memory of the saints! With what absurdity do they not abound, who imagine that the man `emptied himself' to become man, and who maintain that He Who by obedience `humbled himself' to take the form of a servant was made conformable to men even before He took that form upon Him! Who, pray, ye most reckless of men, when he has the form of a servant, takes the form of a servant? and how can any one `empty himself' to become the very thing which he is? You will find no contrivance to meet this, bold as you are in saying or thinking things uncontrivable. Are you not verily of all men most miserable, who suppose that a man has suffered death for all men, and ascribe your own redemption to him? For if it is not of the Word Who was in the beginning and was God that the blessed Peter speaks, but of him who was `seen,' and who `emptied Himself,' as Basil says, and if the man who was seen `emptied Himself' to take `the form of a servant,' and He Who `emptied Himself' to take `the form of a servant,' emptied Himself to come into being as man, then the man who was seen emptied himself to come into being as man[fn-16-P1600_916875:19-nf] . The very nature of things is repugnant to this; and it is expressly contradicted by that writer[fn-16-P1601_918054:20-nf] who celebrates this dispensation in his discourse concerning the Divine Nature, when he says not that the man who was seen, but that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God took upon Him flesh, which is equivalent in other words to taking `the form of a servant.' If, then, you hold that these things are to be believed; depart from your error, and cease to believe that the man `emptied himself' to become man. And if you are not able to persuade those who will not be persuaded, destroy their incredulity by another saying, a second decision against them. Remember him who says, `Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.' There is none among men who will appropriate this phrase to himself. None of the saints that ever lived was the Only-begotten God and became man:-for that is what it means to `take the form of a servant,' `being in the form of God.' If, then, the blessed Peter speaks of Him Who `emptied Himself' to `take the form of a servant,' and if He Who was `in the form of God' did `empty Himself' to `take the form of a servant,' and if He Who in the beginning was God, being the Word and the Only-begotten God, is He Who was `in the form of God,' then the blessed Peter speaks to us of Him Who was in the beginning and was God, and expounds to us that it was He Who became Lord and Christ. This, then, is the conflict which Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither to have `applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles', nor to be able to preserve the sequence of his own arguments; for, according to them, he must, if he is conscious of their irreconcilable character, admit that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God became Lord; or if he tries to fit together statements that are mutually conflicting, and contentiously stands by them, he will add to them others yet more hostile, and maintain that there are two Christs and two Lords. For if the Word that was in the beginning and was God be one, and He Who `emptied Himself' and `took the form of a servant' be another, and if God the Word, by Whom are all things, be Lord, and this Jesus, Who was crucified after all things had come into being, be Lord also, there are, according to his view, two Lords and Christs. Our author, then, cannot by any argument clear himself from this manifest blasphemy. But if any one were to say in support of him that the Word Who was in the beginning is indeed the same Who became Lord, but that He became Lord and Christ in respect of His presence in the flesh, He will surely be constrained to say that the Son was not Lord before His presence in the flesh. At all events, even if Basil and his faithless followers falsely proclaim two Lords and two Christs, for us there is one Lord and Christ, by Whom all things were made, not becoming Lord by way of promotion, but existing before all creation and before all ages, the Lord Jesus, by Whom are all things, while all the saints with one harmonious voice teach us this truth and proclaim it as the most excellent of doctrines. Here the blessed John teaches us that God the Word, by Whom all things were made, has become incarnate, saying, `And the Word was made flesh[fn-16-P1602_921332:21-nf] '; here the most admirable Paul, urging those who attend to him to humility, speaks of Christ Jesus, Who was in the form of God, and emptied Himself to take the form of a servant, and was humbled to death, even the death of the Cross[fn-16-P1603_921584:22-nf] ; and again in another passage calls Him Who was crucified `the Lord of Glory': `for had they known it,' be says, `they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory[fn-16-P1604_921780:23-nf] '. Indeed, he speaks far more openly than this of the very essential nature by the name of `Lord,' where he says, `Now the Lord is the Spirit[fn-16-P1605_921941:24-nf] '.

We shall therefor repeat word for word the statement laiddown by him, which supports our argument as follows:-\"The blessed John,\" he says,\"teaches us that God the Word, by Whom allthings were made, has become incarnate, saying`And the Word was made flesh.'\" Does he understand what he is writing when he adds this to his own argument? I can hardly myselfthink that the same man can at once be aware of the meaning of these words and contendagainst our statement. For if any one examinesthe words carefully, he will find that there is nomutual conflict between what is said by us and what is said by him. For we both consider the dispensation in the flesh apart, and regard the Divine power in itself: and he, in like manner with ourselves, says that the Word that was in the beginning has been manifested in the flesh: yet no one ever charged him, nor does he charge himself, with preaching \"two Words\", Him Who was in the beginning, and Him Who was made flesh; for he knows, surely, that the Word is identical with the Word, He who appeared in the flesh with Him Who was with God. But the flesh was not identical with the Godhead, till this too was transformed to the Godhead, so that of necessity one set of attributes befits God the Word, and a different set of attributes befits the \"form of the servant[fn-16-P1641_949842:46-nf] .\" If, then, in view of such a confession, he does not reproach himself with the duality of Words, why are we falsely charged with dividing the object of oar faith into \"two Christs\"?-we, who say that He Who was highly exalted after His Passion, was made Lord and Christ by His union[fn-16-P1642_951120:47-nf] with Him Who is verily Lord and Christ, knowing by what we have learnt that the Divine Nature is always one and the same, and with the same mode of existence, while the flesh in itself is that which reason and sense apprehend concerning it, but when mixed[fn-16-P1643_951390:48-nf] with the Divine no longer remains in its own limitations and properties, but is taken up to that which is overwhelming and transcendent. Our contemplation, however, of the respective properties of the flesh and of the Godhead remains free from confusion, so long as each of these is contemplated by itself[fn-16-P1644_951728:49-nf] , as, for example, \"the Word was before the ages, but the flesh came into being in the last times\": but one could not reverse this statement, and say that the latter is pretemporal, or that the Word has come into being in the last times. The flesh is of a passible, the Word of an operative nature: and neither is the flesh capable of making the things that are, nor is the power possessed by the Godhead capable of suffering. The Word was in the beginning with God, the man was subject to the trial of death; and neither was the Human Nature from everlasting, nor the Divine Nature mortal: and all the rest of the attributes are contemplated in the same way. It is not the Human Nature that raises up Lazarus, nor is it the power that cannot suffer that weeps for him when he lies in the grave: the tear proceeds from the Man, the life from the true Life. It is not the Human Nature that feeds the thousands, nor is it omnipotent might that hastens to the fig-tree. Who is it that is weary with the journey, and Who is it that by His word made all the world subsist? What is the brightness of the glory, and what is that that was pierced with the nails? What form is it that is buffeted in the Passion, and what form is it that is glorified from everlasting? So much as this is clear, (even if one does not follow the argument into detail,) that the blows belong to the servant in whom the Lord was, the honours to the Lord Whom the servant compassed about, so that by reason of contact and the union of Natures the proper attributes of each belong to both[fn-16-P1645_953622:50-nf] , as the Lord receives the stripes of the servant, while the servant is glorified with the honour of the Lord; for this is why the Cross is said to be the Cross of the Lord of glory[fn-16-P1646_954208:51-nf] , and why every tongue confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father[fn-16-P1647_954317:52-nf] .","title":"Book V","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_16_lecture_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"12.

And let no one think that the divine Apostle is divided against himself in contradiction, and affords by his own utterances matter for their contentions on either side to those who dispute upon the doctrines. For careful examination would find that his argument is accurately directed to one aim; and he is not halting in his opinions: for while he everywhere proclaims the combination of the Human with the Divine, he none the less discerns in each its proper nature, in the sense that while the human weakness is changed for the better by its communion with the imperishable, the Divine power, on the other hand, is not abased by its contact with the lowly form of nature. When therefore he says, \"He spared not His own Son,\" he contrasts the true Son with the other sons, begotten, or exalted, or adopted[fn-16-P1685_968630:19-nf] (those, I mean, who were brought into being at His command), marking the specialty of nature by the addition of \"own.\" And, to the end that no one should connect the suffering of the Cross with the imperishable nature, he gives in other words a fairly distinct correction of such an error, when he calls Him \"mediator between God and men[fn-16-P1686_969321:20-nf] \" and \"man[fn-16-P1687_969351:21-nf] ,\" and \"God[fn-16-P1688_969382:22-nf] ,\" that, from the fact that both are predicated of the one Being, the fit conception might be entertained concerning each Nature-concerning the Divine Nature, impassibility, concerning the Human Nature, the dispensation of the Passion. As his thought, then, divides that which in love to man was made one, but is distinguished in idea, he uses, when he is proclaiming that nature which transcends and surpasses all intelligence, the more exalted order of names, calling Him \"God over all[fn-16-P1689_969953:23-nf] ,\" \"the great God[fn-16-P1690_969987:24-nf] ,\" \"the power\" of God, and \"the wisdom\". of God[fn-16-P1691_970053:25-nf] , and the like; but when he is alluding to all that experience of suffering which, by reason of our weakness, was necessarily assumed with our nature, he gives to the union of the Natures[fn-16-P1692_970260:26-nf] that name which is derived from ours, and calls Him Man, not by this word placing Him Whom he is setting forth to us on a common level with the rest of nature, but so that orthodoxy is protected as regards each Nature, in the sense that the Human Nature is glorified by His assumption of it, and the Divine is not polluted by Its condescension, but makes the Human element subject to sufferings, while working, through Its Divine power, the resurrection of that which suffered. And thus the experience of death is not[fn-16-P1693_970800:27-nf] referred to Him Who had communion in our passible nature by reason of the union with Him of the Man, while at the same time the exalted and Divine names descend to the Man, so that He Who was manifested upon the Cross is called even \"the Lord of glory[fn-16-P1694_971491:28-nf] ,\" since the majesty implied in these names is transmitted from the Divine to the Human by the commixture of Its Nature with that Nature which is lowly. For this cause he describes Him in varied and different language, at one time as Him Who came down from heaven, at another time as Him Who was born of woman, as God from eternity, and Man in the last days; thus too theOnly-begotten God is held to be impassible, and Christ to be capable of suffering; nor does his discourse speak falsely in these opposing statements, as it adapts in its conceptions to each Nature the terms that belong to it. If then these are the doctrines which we have learnt from inspired teaching, how do we refer the cause of our salvation to an ordinary man? and if we declare the word \"made\" employed by the blessed Peter to have regard not to the pre-temporal existence, but to the new dispensation of the Incarnation, what has this to do with the charge against us? For this great Apostle says that that which was seen in the form of the servant has been made, by being assumed, to be that which He Who assumed it was in His own Nature. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Hebrews we may learn the same truth from Paul, when he says that Jesus was made an Apostle and High Priest by God, \"being faithful to him that made Him so[fn-16-P1695_972815:29-nf] .\" For in that passage too, in giving the name of High Priest to Him Who made with His own Blood the priestly propitiation for our sins, he does not by the word \"made\" declare the first existence of the Only-begotten, but says \"made\" with the intention of representing that grace which is commonly spoken of in connection with the appointment of priests. For Jesus, the great High Priest (as Zechariah says[fn-16-P1696_973257:30-nf] ), Who offered up his own lamb, that is, His own Body, for the sin of the world; Who, by reason of the children that arc partakers of flesh and blood, Himself also in like manner took part with them in blood[fn-16-P1697_973488:31-nf] (not in that He was in the beginning, being the Word and God, and being in the form of God, and equal with God, but in that He emptied Himself in the form of the servant, and offered an oblation and sacrifice for us), He, I say, became a High Priest many generations later, after the order of Melchisedech[fn-16-P1698_973816:32-nf] . Surely a reader who has more than a casual acquaintance with the discourse to the Hebrews knows the mystery of this matter. As, then, in that passage He is said to have been made Priest and Apostle, so here He is said to have been made Lord and Christ,-the latter for the dispensation on our behalf, the former by the change and transformation of the Human to the Divine (for by \"making\" the Apostle means \"making anew\"). Thus is manifest the knavery of our adversaries, who insolently wrest the words referring to the dispensation to apply them to the pretemporal existence. For we learn from the Apostle not to know Christ in the same manner now as before, as Paul thus speaks, \"Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now know we Him no more[fn-16-P1699_974600:33-nf] ,\" in the sense that the one knowledge manifests to us His temporary dispensation, the other His eternal existence. Thus our discourse has made no inconsiderable answer to his charges:-that we neither hold two Christs nor two Lords, that we are not ashamed of the Cross, that we do not glorify a mere man as having suffered for the world, that we assuredly do not think that the word \"made\" refers to the formation of the essence. But, such being our view, our argument has no small support from our accuser himself, where in the midst of his discourse he employs his tongue in a flourishing onslaught upon us, and produces this sentence among others: \"This, then, is the conflict that Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither to have `applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles,' nor to be able to preserve the sequence of his own arguments; for according to them he must, if he is conscious of their irreconcilable character, admit that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God became Lord,\" or he fits together \"statements that are mutually conflicting.\" Why, this is actually our statement which Eunomius repeats, who says that \"the Word that was in the beginning and was God became Lord.\" For, being what He was, God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and Grace, and Truth, and Lord, and Christ, and every name exalted and Divine, He did become, in the Man assumed by Him, Who was none of these, all else which the Word was and among the rest did become Lord and Christ, according to the teaching of Peter, and according to the confession of Eunomius;-not in the sense that the Godhead acquired anything by way of advancement, but (all exalted majesty being contemplated in the Divine Nature) He thus becomes Lord and Christ, not by arriving at any addition of grace in respect of His Godhead (for the Nature of the Godhead is acknowledged to be lacking in no good), but by bringing the Human Nature to theft participation in the Godhead which is signified by the terms \"Christ\" and \"Lord.\"","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"69.

Perceive their unity in the indivisibility of their nature, and apprehend the mystery of that indivisible nature by regarding the One as the mirror of the Other. But remember that He is the mirror, not as the image reflected by the splendour of a nature outside Himself, but as being a living nature, indistinguishable from the Father's living nature, derived wholly from the whole of His Father's, having the Father's in Him because He is the Only begotten, and abiding in the Father, because He is God.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_22_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"To him, therefore, who is reluctant to endure the troublesome process, whereby this vaunting disposition is restrained, before he attains to the ultimate and highest perfection of charity, it is most properly said, \"My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness,\"[fn-32-P3266_1269289:27-nf] -in weakness, that is, not of the flesh only, as this man supposes, but both of the flesh and of the mind; because the mind, too, was, in comparison of that last stage of complete perfection, weak, and to it also was assigned, in order to check its elation, that messenger of Satan, the thorn in the flesh; although it was very strong, in contrast with the carnal or animal faculties, which as yet understand not the things of the Spirit of God.[fn-32-P3267_1269755:28-nf] Inasmuch, then, as strength is made perfect in weakness, whoever does not own himself to be weak, is not in the way to be perfected.

He asserts that the word \"Lord\" is significative of essence, and by way of proof of this assumption he brings up the passage above mentioned. \"The Lord,\" it says, \"is the Spirit[fn-17-P1750_1009311:2-nf] .\" But our friend who interprets Scripture at his own sweet will calls \"Lordship\" by the name of \"essence,\" and thinks to bring his statement to proof by means of the words quoted. Well, if it had been said by Paul, \"Now the Lord is essence,\" we too would have concurred in his argument. But seeing that the inspired writing on the one side says, \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and Eunomius says on the other, \"Lordship is essence,\" I do not know where he finds support for his statement, unless he is prepared to say again[fn-17-P1751_1009849:3-nf] that the word \"Spirit\" stands in Scripture for \"essence.\" Let us consider, then, whether the Apostle anywhere, in his use of the term \"Spirit,\" employs that word to indicate \"essence.\" He says, \"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our Spirit[fn-17-P1752_1010220:4-nf] ,\" and \"no one knoweth the things of a man save the Spirit of man which is in him[fn-17-P1753_1010320:5-nf] ,\" and \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life[fn-17-P1754_1010393:6-nf] ,\" and \"if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live[fn-17-P1755_1010492:7-nf] ,\" and \"if we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit[fn-17-P1756_1010574:8-nf] .\" Who indeed could count the utterances of the Apostle on this point? and in them we nowhere find \"essence\" signified by this word. For he who says that \"the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit,\" signifies nothing else than the Holy Spirit Which comes to be in the mind of the faithful; for in many other passages of his writings he gives the name of spirit to the mind, on the reception by which of the communion of the Spirit the recipients attain the dignity of adoption. Again, in the passage, \"No one knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him,\" if \"man\" is used of the essence, and \"spirit\" likewise, it will follow from the phrase that the man is maintained to be of two essences. Again, I know not how he who says that \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,\" sets \"essence\" in opposition to \"letter\"; nor, again, how this writer imagines that when Paul says that we ought \"through the Spirit\" to destroy \"the deeds of the body,\" he is directing the signification of \"spirit\" to express \"essence\"; while as for \"living in the Spirit,\" and \"walking in the Spirit,\" this would be quite unintelligible if the sense of the word \"Spirit\" referred to \"essence.\" For in what else than in essence do all we who are alive partake of life?-thus when the Apostle is laying down advice for us on this matter that we should \"live in essence,\" it is as though he said \"partake of life by means of yourselves, and not by means of others.\" If then it is not possible that this sense can be adopted in any passage, how can Eunomius here once more imitate the interpreters of dreams, and bid us to take \"spirit.\" for \"essence,\" to the end that he may arrive in due syllogistic form at his conclusion that the word \"Lord\" is applied to the essence?-for if \"spirit\" is \"essence\" (he argues), and \"the Lord is Spirit,\" the \"Lord\" is clearly found to be \"essence.\" How incontestable is the force of this attempt! How can we evade or resolve this irrefragable necessity of demonstration? The word \"Lord,\" he says, is spoken of the essence. How does he maintain it? Because the Apostle says, \"The Lord is the Spirit.\" Well, what has this to do with essence? He gives us the further instruction that \"spirit\" is put for \"essence. These are the arts of his demonstrative method! These are the results of his Aristotelian science! This is why, in your view, we are so much to be pitied, who are uninitiated in this wisdom! and you of course are to be deemed happy, who track out the truth by a method like this-that the Apostle's meaning was such that we are to suppose \"the Spirit\" was put by him for the Essence of the Only-begotten!","title":"Book VII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"64.

But ofttimes the earnestness of those who are desirous of hearing me shows me that my utterance is not so frigid as it seems i to myself to be. From the delight, too, which they exhibit, I gather that they derive some profit from it. And I occupy myself sedulously with the endeavor not to fail in putting before them a service in which I perceive them to take in such good part what is put before them. Even, so, on your side also, the very fact that persons who require to be instructed in the faith are brought so frequently to you, ought to help you to understand that your discourse is not displeasing to others as it is displeasing to yourself; and you ought not to consider yourself unfruitful, simply because you do not succeed in setting forth in such a manner as you desire the things which you discern; for, perchance, you may be just as little able to discern them in the way you wish. For in this life who sees except as \"in an enigma and through a glass\"?[fn-28-P2829_1301255:8-nf] Neither is love itself of might sufficient to rend the darkness of the flesh, and penetrate into that eternal calm from which even things which pass away derive the light in which they shine. But inasmuch as day by day the good are making advances towards the vision of that day, independent of the rolling sky,[fn-28-P2830_1301588:9-nf] and without the invasion of the night, \"which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man,\"[fn-28-P2831_1301741:10-nf] there is no greater reason why our discourse should become valueless in our own estimate, when we are engaged in teaching the uninstructed, than this,-namely, that it is a delight to us to discern in an extraordinary fashion, and a weariness to speak in an ordinary. And in reality we are listened to with much greater satisfaction, indeed, when we ourselves also have pleasure in the same work; for the thread of our address is affected by the very joy of which we ourselves are sensible, and it proceeds from us with greater ease and with more acceptance. Consequently, as regards those matters which are recommended as articles of belief, the task is not a difficult one to lay down injunctions, with respect to the points at which the narration should be commenced and ended, or with respect to the method in which the narration is to be varied, so that at one time it may be briefer, at another more lengthened, and yet at all times full and perfect; and, again, with respect to the particular occasions on which it may be right to use the shorter form, and those on which it will be proper to employ the longer. But as to the means by which all is to be done, so that every one may have pleasure in his work when he catechises (for the better he succeeds in this the more attractive will he be),-that is what requires the greatest consideration. And yet we have not far to seek for the precept which will rule in this sphere. For if, in the matter of carnal means, God loves a cheerful giver,[fn-28-P2832_1303259:11-nf] how much more so in that of the spiritual? But our security that this cheerfulness may be with us at the seasonable hour, is something dependent upon the mercy of Him who has given us such precepts. Therefore, in accordance with my understanding of what your own wish is, we shall discuss in the first place the subject of the method of narration, then that of the duty of delivering injunction and exhortation, and afterwards that of the attainment of the said cheerfulness, so far as God may furnish us with the ideas.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_25_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"27. \"But as to the man who has in view that everlasting blessedness and perpetual rest which is promised as the lot destined for the saints after this life, and who desires to become a Christian, in order that he may not pass into eternal fire with the devil, but enter into the eternal kingdom together with Christ,[fn-29-P2977_1387615:103-nf] such an one is truly a Christian; (and he will be) on his guard in every temptation, so that he may neither be corrupted by prosperity nor be utterly broken in spirit by adversity, but remain at once modest and temperate when the good things of earth abound with him, and brave and patient when tribulations overtake him.

But you do not even deny God intelligently,[fn-42-P4293_1396239:15-nf] you treat of Him ignorantly;[fn-42-P4294_1396284:16-nf] nay, you accuse Him with a semblance of intelligence,[fn-42-P4295_1396356:17-nf] whom if you did but know Him, you would never accuse, nay, never treat of.[fn-42-P4296_1396450:18-nf] You give Him His name indeed, but you deny the essential truth of that name, that is, the greatness which is called God; not acknowledging it to be such as, were it possible for it to have been known to man in every respect,[fn-42-P4297_1396693:19-nf] would not be greatness. Isaiah even so early, with the clearness of an apostle, foreseeing the thoughts of heretical hearts, asked, \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? For who hath been His counsellor? With whom took He counsel? ... or who taught Him knowledge, and showed to Him the way of understanding? \"[fn-42-P4298_1397018:20-nf] With whom the apostle agreeing exclaims, \"Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"[fn-42-P4299_1397241:21-nf] \"His judgments unsearchable,\" as being those of God the Judge; and \"His ways past finding out,\" as comprising an understanding and knowledge which no man has ever shown to Him, except it may be those critics of the Divine Being, who say, God ought not to have been this,[fn-43-P4300_1397530:22-nf] and He ought rather to have been that; as if any one knew what is in God, except the Spirit of God.[fn-43-P4301_1397717:23-nf] Moreover, having the spirit of the world, and \"in the wisdom of God by wisdom knowing not God,\"[fn-43-P4302_1397833:24-nf] they seem to themselves to be wiser[fn-43-P4303_1397886:25-nf] than God; because, as the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God, so also the wisdom of God is folly in the world's esteem. We, however, know that \"the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\"[fn-43-P4304_1398147:26-nf] Accordingly, God is then especially great, when He is small[fn-43-P4305_1398226:27-nf] to man; then especially good, when not good in man's judgment; then especially unique, when He seems to man to be two or more. Now, if from the very first \"the natural man, not receiving the things of the Spirit of God,\"[fn-43-P4306_1398462:28-nf] has deemed God's law to be foolishness, and has therefore neglected to observe it; and as a further consequence, by his not having faith, \"even that which he seemeth to have hath been taken from him\"[fn-43-P4307_1398682:29-nf] -such as the grace of paradise and the friendship of God, by means of which he might have known all things of God, if he had continued in his obedience-what wonder is it, if he,[fn-43-P4308_1398902:30-nf] reduced to his material nature, and banished to the toil of tilling the ground, has in his very labour, downcast and earth-gravitating as it was, handed on that earth-derived spirit of the world to his entire race, wholly natural[fn-43-P4309_1399177:31-nf] and heretical as it is, and not receiving the things which belong to God? Or who will hesitate to declare the great sin of Adam to have been heresy, when he committed it by the choice[fn-43-P4310_1399386:32-nf] of his own will rather than of God's? Except that Adam never said to his fig-tree, Why hast thou made me thus? He confessed that he was led astray; and he did not conceal the seducer. He was a very rude heretic. He was disobedient; but yet he did not blaspheme his Creator, nor blame that Author of his being, Whom from the beginning of his life he had found to be so good and excellent, and Whom he had perhaps[fn-43-P4311_1399911:33-nf] made his own judge from the very first.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_26_book_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"11. The inquirer might bring forward as a difficulty the fact that those in whose books these prophecies are found are not united with us in the gospel. But when convinced that this also is foretold, he would feel how strong the evidence is. The prophecies of the unbelief of the Jews no one can avoid seeing, no one can pretend to be blind to them. No one can doubt that Isaiah spoke of the Jews when he said, \"The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel hath not known, and my people hath not considered ;\"[fn-15-P1545_838326:19-nf] or again, in the words quoted by the apostle, \"I have stretched out my hands all the day to a wicked and gainsaying people;\"[fn-15-P1546_838467:20-nf] and especially where he says, \"God has given them the spirit of remorse, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, and should not understand,\"[fn-15-P1547_838669:21-nf] and many similar passages.

And inasmuch as there are three things of which man consists,-namely, spirit, soul, and body,-which again are spoken of as two, because frequently the soul is named along with the spirit; for a certain rational portion of the same, of which beasts are devoid, is called spirit: the principal part in us is the spirit; next, the life whereby we are united with the body is called the soul; finally, the body itself, as it is visible, is the last part in us. This \"whole creation\" (creatura), however, \"groaneth and travaileth until now.\"[fn-33-P3307_1516831:117-nf] Nevertheless, He has given it the first-fruits of the Spirit, in that it has believed God, and is now of a good will.[fn-33-P3308_1516971:118-nf] This spirit is also called the mind, regarding which an apostle speaks thus: \"With the mind I serve the law of God.\"[fn-33-P3309_1517264:119-nf] Which apostle likewise expresses himself thus in another passage: \"For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit.\"[fn-33-P3310_1517403:120-nf] Moreover, the soul, when as yet it lusts after carnal good things, is called the flesh. For a certain part thereof resists[fn-33-P3311_1517544:121-nf] the Spirit, not in virtue of nature, but in virtue of the custom of sins; whence it is said, \"With the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And this custom has been turned into a nature, according to mortal generation, by the sin of the first man. Consequently it is also written in this wise, \"And we were sometime by nature the children of wrath,\"[fn-33-P3312_1518089:122-nf] that is, of vengeance, through which it has come to pass that we serve the law of sin. The nature of the soul, however, is perfect when it is made subject to its own spirit, and when it follows that spirit as the same follows God. Therefore \"the animal man[fn-33-P3313_1518365:123-nf] receiveth not the things which are of the Spirit of God.\"[fn-33-P3314_1518474:124-nf] But the soul is not so speedily subdued to the spirit unto good action, as is the spirit to God unto true faith and goodwill; but sometimes its impetus, whereby it moves downwards into things carnal and temporal, is more tardily bridled. But inasmuch as this same soul is also made pure, and receives the stability of its own nature, under the dominance of the spirit, which is the head for it, which head of the said soul has again its own head in Christ, we ought not to despair of the restoration of the body also to its own proper nature. But this certainly will not be effected so speedily as is the case with the soul; just as the soul too, is not restored so speedily as the spirit. Yet it will take place in the appropriate season, at the last trump, when \"the dead shall rise uncorrupted, and we shall be changed.\"[fn-33-P3315_1519321:125-nf] And accordingly we believe also in The Resurrection of the Flesh, to wit, not merely that that soul, which at present by reason of carnal affections is called the flesh, is restored; but that it shall be so likewise with this visible flesh, which is the flesh according to nature, the name of which has been received by the soul, not in virtue of nature, but in reference to carnal affections: this visible flesh, then, I say, which is the flesh properly so called, must without doubt be believed to be destined to rise again. For the Apostle Paul appears to point to this, as it were, with his finger, when he says, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption.\"[fn-33-P3316_1520005:126-nf] For when he says this, he, as it were, directs his finger toward it. Now it is that which is visible that admits of being pointed out with the finger; since the soul might also have been called corruptible, for it is itself corrupted by vices of manners. And when it is read, \"and this mortal [must] put on immortality,\" the same visible flesh is signified, inasmuch as at it ever and anon the finger is thus as it were pointed. For the soul also may thus in like manner be called mortal, even as it is designated corruptible in reference to vices of manners.

This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets!

Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. \"In the mouth of three witnesses,\" says He, \"shall every word be established.\"[fn-61-P6160_1843707:859-nf] He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only tight that the New Testament should be attested[fn-61-P6161_1843999:860-nf] on such an elevated spot[fn-61-P6162_1844043:861-nf] as that whereon the Old Testament had been composed;[fn-61-P6163_1844119:862-nf] under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he[fn-61-P6164_1844267:863-nf] had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;[fn-61-P6165_1844398:864-nf] or else it was only a precarious cloud,[fn-61-P6166_1844500:865-nf] as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,[fn-61-P6181_1848177:880-nf] after that Moses and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ. But we have the entire structure[fn-61-P6182_1848541:881-nf] of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some[fn-61-P6183_1848634:882-nf] of the apostles says, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid.\" What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye, Him? \"I considered thy works, and was astonished.\" When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying? \"In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known\"-even Moses and Elias.[fn-61-P6184_1849050:883-nf] These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.[fn-61-P6185_1849261:884-nf] For these are they of whom he says, \"They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\" And again Habakkuk says, \"His glory covered the heavens\" (that is, with that cloud), \"and His splendour shall be like the light-even the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.\" And if we would make mention of[fn-61-P6186_1849613:885-nf] the promise to Moses, we shall find it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,\"[fn-61-P6187_1849874:886-nf] the sight which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the face of God, however, he had already heard, \"No man shall see me, and live.\" \"This thing,\" said He, \"which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee.\" Then Moses said, \"Show me Thy glory.\" And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, \"I will pass before thee in my glory,\" etc. Then at the last He says, \"And then thou shall see my back.\"[fn-61-P6188_1850423:887-nf] Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.[fn-61-P6189_1850569:888-nf] He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, \"If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently\" (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), \"and not in dark speeches.\"[fn-61-P6190_1851193:889-nf] Now, although Marcion has denied[fn-61-P6191_1851248:890-nf] that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood \"mouth to mouth,\" he must also have stood \"face to face\" with him, to use his words,[fn-61-P6192_1851451:891-nf] not far from him, in His very glory-not to say,[fn-61-P6193_1851553:892-nf] in His presence.

This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display?

Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade.

On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,[fn-61-P6181_1848177:880-nf] after that Moses and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ. But we have the entire structure[fn-61-P6182_1848541:881-nf] of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some[fn-61-P6183_1848634:882-nf] of the apostles says, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid.\" What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye, Him? \"I considered thy works, and was astonished.\" When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying? \"In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known\"-even Moses and Elias.[fn-61-P6184_1849050:883-nf] These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.[fn-61-P6185_1849261:884-nf] For these are they of whom he says, \"They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\" And again Habakkuk says, \"His glory covered the heavens\" (that is, with that cloud), \"and His splendour shall be like the light-even the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.\" And if we would make mention of[fn-61-P6186_1849613:885-nf] the promise to Moses, we shall find it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,\"[fn-61-P6187_1849874:886-nf] the sight which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the face of God, however, he had already heard, \"No man shall see me, and live.\" \"This thing,\" said He, \"which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee.\" Then Moses said, \"Show me Thy glory.\" And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, \"I will pass before thee in my glory,\" etc. Then at the last He says, \"And then thou shall see my back.\"[fn-61-P6188_1850423:887-nf] Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.[fn-61-P6189_1850569:888-nf] He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, \"If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently\" (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), \"and not in dark speeches.\"[fn-61-P6190_1851193:889-nf] Now, although Marcion has denied[fn-61-P6191_1851248:890-nf] that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood \"mouth to mouth,\" he must also have stood \"face to face\" with him, to use his words,[fn-61-P6192_1851451:891-nf] not far from him, in His very glory-not to say,[fn-61-P6193_1851553:892-nf] in His presence. And with this glory he went away enlightened from Christ, just as he used to do from the Creator; as then to dazzle the eyes of the children of Israel, so now to smite those of the blinded Marcion, who has failed to see how this argument also makes against him.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_113_letter_lix_to_epictetus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"10.

For who is so devoid of understanding as to think that there is anything in what Eunomius says, or to see any ingenuity in his artifices against the truth when he takes our Master's reference to corn (which he meant simply by way of illustration, thereby providing his hearers with a sort of method and introduction to the study of higher instances), and applies it literally to the Lord of all? To think of his assertion that the most becoming cause for God's begetting the Son was His sovereign authority and power, which may be said not only in regard to the universe and its elements, but in regard to beasts and creeping things; and of our reverend theologian teaching that the same is becoming in our conception of God the Only-begotten-or again, of his saying that God was called ungenerate, or Father, or any other name, even before the existence of creatures to call Him such, as being afraid lest, His name not being uttered among creatures as yet unborn, He should be ignorant or forgetful of Himself, through ignorance of His own nature because of His name being unspoken! To think, again, of the insolence of his attack upon our teaching; what acrimony, what subtlety does he display, while attempting to establish the absurdity of what he (Basil) said, namely that He Who was in a manner the Father before all worlds and time, and all sensitive and intellectual nature, must somehow wait for man's creation in order to be named by means of man's conception, not having been so named, either by the Son or by any of the intelligent beings of His creation!

For even in the case of human beings, we should have no need of using words and names if we could otherwise inform each other of our pure mental feelings and impulses.

They are different sayings, \"Whither shall I go away from Thy Spirit, and from Thy face whither shall I flee?\"[fn-40-P4035_1913235:124-nf] and, \"One thing I have sought of the Lord, this I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord through all the days of my life, that I may consider the delight of the Lord, that I be protected in His temple:\"[fn-40-P4036_1913480:125-nf] and, \"Turn not away Thy face from me:\"[fn-40-P4037_1913540:126-nf] and, \"My soul longeth and fainteth unto the courts of the Lord.[fn-40-P4038_1913625:127-nf] Those sayings let him have had, who dared not to lift up his eyes to heaven; and she who was watering with tears His feet, in order to obtain pardon for her grievous sins; but these do thou have, who art careful about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit. With those sayings there companies fear which hath torment, which perfect charity casteth forth; but with these sayings there companies chaste fear of the Lord, that abideth for ever and ever. And to both kinds it must be said, \"Be not thou high-minded, but fear;\"[fn-40-P4039_1914191:128-nf] that man neither of defense of his sins, nor of presumption of righteousness set himself up. For Paul also himself, who saith, \"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;\"[fn-40-P4040_1914403:129-nf] yet, fear being a companion of charity, saith, \"With fear and much trembling was I towards you:\"[fn-40-P4041_1914522:130-nf] and that saying, which I have mentioned, that the engrafted wild olive tree be not proud against the broken branches of the olive tree, himself made use of, saying, \"Be not thou high-minded, but fear;\" himself admonishing all the members of Christ in general, saith, \"With fear and trembling work out your own salvation; for it is God Who worketh in you both to will and to do, according to His good pleasure;\"[fn-40-P4042_1914954:131-nf] that it seem not to pertain unto the Old Testament what is written, \"Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.\"[fn-40-P4043_1915122:132-nf] ","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_27_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"181","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"135.

Wherefore, forasmuch as in the beginning of this little work I had proposed certain two necessary matters, and had undertaken to follow them out; one which related to doctrine, the other to exhortation; and I have not failed in the former part, to the best of my power, according to the business which I had undertaken; let us come to exhortation, in order that the good which is known wisely, may be pursued ardently. And in this matter I give you this advice first, that, how great soever love of pious continence you feel to De in you, you ascribe it to the favor of God, and give Him thanks, Who of His Holy Spirit hath freely given unto you so much, as that, His love being shed abroad in your heart, the love of a better good should take, away from you the permission of a lawful matter. For it was His gift to you that you should not wish to marry, when it was lawful, in order that now it should not be lawful, even if you wished; and that by this means the wish not to do it might be the more settled, lest what were now unlawful be done, which was not done even when lawful; and that, a widow of Christ, you should so far attain as to see your daughter also a virgin of Christ; for whilst you are praying as Anna, she hath become what Mary was. These by how much the more you know them to be gifts of God, by so much the more are you by the same gifts blessed; yea, rather, you are not so otherwise than as you know from Whom you have what you have. For listen to what the Apostle said on this matter, \"But we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit Which is of God, that we may know what things have been given to us by God.\"[fn-41-P4198_1986859:46-nf] Forsooth many have many gifts of God, and by not knowing from Whom they have them, come to boast themselves with impious vanity. But there is no one blessed with the gifts of God, who is ungrateful to the Giver. Forasmuch as, also, whereas in the course of the sacred Mysteries we are bidden to \"lift up our hearts,\" it is by His help that we are able, by Whose bidding we are admonished; and therefore it follows, that, of this so great good of the heart lifted up, we give not the glory to ourselves as of our own strength, but render thanks unto our Lord God. For of this we are straightway admonished, that \"this is meet,\" \"this is right.\" You remember whence these words are taken, you recognize by what sanction, and by how great holiness they are commended within. Therefore hold and have what you have received, and return thanks to the Giver. For, although it be yours to receive and have, yet you have that, which you have received; forasmuch as to one waxing proud, and impiously glorying of that which he had, as though he had it of himself, the Truth saith by the Apostle, \"But what hast thou, which thou hast not received?[fn-41-P4199_1988017:47-nf] But, if thou hast received, why boastest thou, as if thou hadst not received?\"[fn-42-P4200_1988217:48-nf] ","title":"On the Good of Widowhood","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_37_against_hermogenes_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If any material was necessary to God in the creation of the world, as Hermogenes supposed, God had a far nobler and more suitable one in His own wisdom[fn-83-P8382_2368372:163-nf] -one which was not to be gauged by the writings of[fn-83-P8383_2368453:164-nf] philosophers, but to be learnt from the words or prophets.

For \"who knoweth the things of God, and the things in God, but the Spirit, which is in Him? \"[fn-83-P8384_2368666:165-nf] Now His wisdom is that Spirit. This was His counsellor, the very way of His wisdom and knowledge.[fn-83-P8385_2368786:166-nf] Of this He made all things, making them through It, and making them with It. \"When He prepared the heavens,\" so says (the Scripture[fn-83-P8386_2368938:167-nf] ), \"I was present with Him; and when He strengthened above the winds the lofty clouds, and when He secured the fountains[fn-83-P8387_2369123:168-nf] which are under the heaven, I was present, compacting these things[fn-83-P8388_2369381:169-nf] along with Him.

Indeed, as soon as He perceived It to be necessary for His creation of the world, He immediately creates It, and generates It in Himself. \"The Lord,\" says the Scripture, \"possessed[fn-83-P8393_2370341:174-nf] me, the beginning of His ways for the creation of His works. Before the worlds He rounded me; before He made the earth, before the mountains were settled in their places; moreover, before the hills He generated me, and prior to the depths was I begotten.\"[fn-83-P8394_2370621:175-nf] Let Hermogenes then confess that the very Wisdom of God is declared to be born and created, for the especial reason that we should not suppose that there is any other being than God alone who is unbegotten and uncreated. For if that, which from its being inherent in the Lord[fn-83-P8395_2370920:176-nf] was of Him and in Him, was yet not without a beginning,-I mean[fn-83-P8396_2371005:177-nf] His wisdom, which was then born and created, when in the thought of God It began to assume motion[fn-83-P8397_2371120:178-nf] for the arrangement of His creative works,-how much more impossible[fn-83-P8398_2371211:179-nf] is it that anything should have been without a beginning which was extrinsic to the Lord![fn-83-P8399_2371331:180-nf] But if this same Wisdom is the Word of God, in the capacity[fn-84-P8400_2371413:181-nf] of Wisdom, and (as being He) without whom nothing was made, just as also (nothing) was set in order without Wisdom, how can it be that anything, except the Father, should be older, and on this account indeed nobler, than the Son of God, the only-begotten and first-begotten Word? Not to say that[fn-84-P8401_2371723:182-nf] what is unbegotten is stronger than that which is born, and what is not made more powerful than that which is made. Because that which did not require a Maker to give it existence, will be much more elevated in rank than that which had an author to bring it into being. On this principle, then,[fn-84-P8402_2372032:183-nf] if evil is indeed unbegotten, whilst the Son of God is begotten (\"for,\" says God, \"my heart hath emitted my most excellent Word\"[fn-84-P8403_2372177:184-nf] ), I am not quite sure that evil may not be introduced by good, the stronger by the weak, in the same way as the unbegotten is by the begotten.

For we must take most especial heed that we confess Christ not only one, but always one. For it were intolerable blasphemy, if while thou dost confess Him one now, thou shouldst maintain that once He was not one, but two; one forsooth since His baptism, but two at His birth. Which monstrous sacrilege we shall assuredly in no wise avoid unless we acknowledge the manhood united to the Godhead (but by unity of Person), not from the ascension, or the resurrection, or the baptism, but even in His mother, even in the womb, even in the Virigin's very conception.[fn-15-P1593_699571:53-nf] In consequence of which unity of Person, both those attributes which are proper to God are ascribed to man, and those which are proper to the flesh to God, indifferently and promiscuously.[fn-15-P1594_700669:54-nf] For hence it is written by divine guidance, on the one hand, that the Son of man came down from heaven;[fn-15-P1595_701552:55-nf] and on the other, that the Lord of glory was crucified on earth.[fn-15-P1596_701640:56-nf] Hence it is also that since the Lord's flesh was made, since the Lord's flesh was created, the very Word of God is said to have been made, the very omniscient Wisdom of God to have been created, just as propehtically His hands and His feet are described as having been pierced.[fn-15-P1597_701937:57-nf] From this unity of Person it follows, by reason of a like mystery, that, since the flesh of the Word was born of an undefiled mother, God the Word Himself is most Catholicly believed, most impiously denied, to have been born of the Virgin; which being the case, God forbid that any one should seek to defraud Holy Mary of her prerogative of divine grace and her special glory. For by the singular gift of Him who is our Lord and God, and withal, her own son, she is to be confessed most truly and most blessedly-The mother of God \"Theotocos,\" but not in the sense in which it is imagined by a certain impious heresy which maintains, that she is to be called the Mother of God for no other reason than because she gave birth to that man who afterwards became God, just as we speak of a woman as the mother of a priest, or the mother of a bishop, meaning that she was such, not by giving birth to one already a priest or a bishop, but by giving birth to one who afterwards became a priest or a bishop. Not thus, I say, was the holy Mary \"Theotocos,\" the mother of God, but rather, as was said before, because in her sacred womb was wrought that most sacred mystery whereby, on account of the singular and unique unity of Person, as the Word in flesh is flesh, so Man in God is God.[fn-15-P1598_703237:58-nf] ","title":"Introduction.","author":"Vincent of Lerins"},{"chapter":2,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_35_book_iv","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"61. Such a teacher as is here described may, to secure compliance, speak not only quietly and temperately, but even vehemently, without any breach of modesty, because his life protects him against contempt.

In his very speech even he prefers to please by matter rather than by words; thinks that a thing is well said in proportion as it is true in fact, and that a teacher should govern his words, not let the words govern him. This is what the apostle says: \"Not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.\"[fn-54-P5485_2909681:81-nf] To the same effect also is what he says to Timothy: \"Charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.\"[fn-54-P5486_2909870:82-nf] Now this does not mean that, when adversaries oppose the truth, we are to say nothing in defence of the truth.

The man who does not strive about words, whether he speak quietly, temperately or vehemently, uses words with no other purpose than to make the truth plain, pleasing, and effective; for not even love itself, which is the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law,[fn-54-P5488_2910647:84-nf] can be rightly exercised unless the objects of love are true and not false. For as a man with a comely body but an ill-conditioned mind is a more painful object than if his body too were deformed, so men who teach lies are the more pitiable if they happen to be eloquent in speech. To speak eloquently, then, and wisely as well, is just to express truths which it is expedient to teach in fit and proper words,-words which in the subdued style are adequate, in the temperate, elegant, and in the majestic, forcible.

These four are, as it were, the elements of the faith of the Church, out of which elements the whole world which is reconciled to God in Christ is put together; as Paul says,[fn-61-P6133_937094:23-nf] \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself; \"of which world Jesus bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is written,[fn-61-P6134_937266:24-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" The Gospels then being four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you[fn-61-P6135_937437:25-nf] have enjoined me to search into according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of Abraham and of David, says:[fn-61-P6136_937786:26-nf] \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\" And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, God the Word. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, \"The former treatise did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,\" yet leaves to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, \"I am the light of the world,\" \"I am the way and the truth and the life,\" \"I am the resurrection, \"I am the door,\" \"I am the good shepherd; \"and in the Apocalypse, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\" We may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are the first fruits of all the Scriptures, but that of the Gospels that of John is the first fruits. No one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus' breast and received from Jesus Mary to be his mother also. Such an one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, \"Woman, behold thy son,\"[fn-61-P6137_939156:27-nf] and not \"Behold you have this son also,\" then He virtually said to her, \"Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.\" Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer,[fn-61-P6138_939364:28-nf] but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, \"Behold thy son Christ.\" What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears? What shall we say of this work? He who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be able to say with truth,[fn-61-P6139_939891:29-nf] \"We have the mind of Christ, that we may know those things which are bestowed on us by God.\" It is possible to quote one of Paul's sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel. He writes in a certain place:[fn-61-P6140_940160:30-nf] \"According to my Gospel.\" Now we have no written work of Paul which is commonly called a Gospel. But all that he preached and said was the Gospel; and what he preached and said he was also in the habit of writing, and what he wrote was therefore Gospel. But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ's sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present reality in those souls which were willing to receive the Word of God as He stood at the door and knocked and sought to come into them.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-10","text":"For what would the narrative of the sensible Gospel amount to if it were not developed to a spiritual one?

Now what the Gospels say is to be regarded in the light of promises of good things; and we must say that the good things the Apostles announce in this Gospel are simply Jesus. one good thing which they are said to announce is the resurrection; but the resurrection is in a manner Jesus, for Jesus says:[fn-61-P6164_950317:41-nf] \"I am the resurrection.\" Jesus preaches to the poor those things which are laid up for the saints, calling them to the divine promises. And the holy Scriptures bear witness to the Gospel announcements made by the Apostles and to that made by our Saviour. David says of the Apostles, perhaps also of the evangelists:[fn-61-P6165_950651:42-nf] \"The Lord shall give the word to those that preach with great power; the King of the powers of the beloved; \"teaching at the same time that it is not skilfully composed discourse, nor the mode of delivery, nor well practised eloquence that produces conviction, but the communication of divine power. Hence also Paul says:[fn-61-P6166_950996:43-nf] \"I will know not the word that is puffed up, but the power; for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.\" And in another passage:[fn-61-P6167_951183:44-nf] \"And my word and my preaching were not persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power.\" To this power Simon and Cleophas bear witness when they say:[fn-61-P6168_951380:45-nf] \"Was not our heart burning within us by the way, as he opened to us the Scriptures? \"And the Apostles, since the quantity of the power is great which God supplies to the speakers, had great power, according to the word of David: \"The Lord will give the word to the preachers with great power.\" Isaiah too says:[fn-61-P6169_951711:46-nf] \"How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim good tidings; \"he sees how beautiful and how opportune was the announcement of the Apostles who walked in Him who said, \"I am the way,\" and praises the feet of those who walk in the intellectual way of Christ Jesus, and through that door go in to God. They announce good tidings, those whose feet are beautiful, namely, Jesus.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-03","text":"There are, to be sure, other things also quite as foolish (as the birth of Christ), which have reference to the humiliations and sufferings of God.

We have said above that He might possibly have undergone the unreal mockeries[fn-93-P9321_2558783:66-nf] of an imaginary birth and infancy. But answer me at once, you that murder truth: Was not God really crucified? And, having been really crucified, did He not really die? And, having indeed really died, did He not really rise again? Falsely did Paul[fn-93-P9322_2559052:67-nf] \"determine to know nothing amongst us but Jesus and Him crucified; \"[fn-93-P9323_2559175:68-nf] falsely has he impressed upon us that He was buried; falsely inculcated that He rose again. False, therefore, is our faith also. And all that we hope for from Christ will be a phantom. O thou most infamous of men, who acquittest of all guilt[fn-93-P9324_2559436:69-nf] the murderers of God! For nothing did Christ suffer from them, if He really suffered nothing at all. Spare the whole world's one only hope, thou who art destroying the indispensable dishonour of our faith[fn-93-P9325_2559655:70-nf] Whatsoever is unworthy of God, is of gain to me.

The Son of God was crucified; I am not ashamed because men must needs be ashamed of it. And the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd.[fn-93-P9327_2560280:72-nf] And He was buried, and rose again; the fact is certain, because it is impossible. But how will all this be true in Him, if He was not Himself true-if He really had not in Himself that which might be crucified, might die, might be buried, and might rise again? I mean this flesh suffused with blood, built up with bones, interwoven with nerves, entwined with veins, a flesh which knew how to be born, and how to die, human without doubt, as born of a human being. It will therefore be mortal in Christ, because Christ is man and the Son of man. Else why is Christ man and the Son of man, if he has nothing of man, and nothing from man? Unless it be either that man is anything else than flesh, or man's flesh comes from any other source than man, or Mary is anything else than a human being, or Marcion's man is as Marcion's god.[fn-93-P9328_2561123:73-nf] Otherwise Christ could not be described as being man without flesh, nor the Son of man without any human parent; just as He is not God without the Spirit of God, nor the Son of God without having God for His father. Thus the nature[fn-93-P9329_2561391:74-nf] of the two substances displayed Him as man and God,-in one respect born, in the other unborn; l in one respect fleshly in the other spiritual; in one sense weak in the other exceeding strong; in on sense dying, in the other living. This property of the two states-the divine and the human-is distinctly asserted[fn-93-P9330_2561730:75-nf] with equal truth of both natures alike, with the same belief both in respect of the Spirit[fn-93-P9331_2561841:76-nf] and of the flesh. The powers of the Spirit,[fn-93-P9332_2562045:77-nf] proved Him to be God, His sufferings attested the flesh of man. If His powers were not without the Spirit[fn-93-P9333_2562311:78-nf] in like manner, were not His sufferings without the flesh. if His flesh with its sufferings was fictitious, for the same reason was the Spirit false with all its powers. Wherefore halve[fn-93-P9334_2562657:79-nf] Christ with a lie? He was wholly the truth. Believe me, He chose rather to be born, than in any part to pretend-and that indeed to His own detriment-that He was bearing about a flesh hardened without bones, solid without muscles, bloody without blood, clothed without the tunic of skin,[fn-93-P9335_2562960:80-nf] hungry without appetite, eating without teeth, speaking without a tongue, so that His word was a phantom to the ears through an imaginary voice. A phantom, too, it was of course after the resurrection, when, showing His hands and His feet for the disciples to examine, He said, \"Behold and see that it is I myself, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have; \"[fn-93-P9336_2563373:81-nf] without doubt, hands, and feet, and bones are not what a spirit possesses, but only the flesh. Howdo you interpret this statement, Marcion, you who tell us that Jesus comes only from the most excellent God, who is both simple and good? See how He rather cheats, and deceives, and juggles the eyes of all, and the senses of all, as well as their access to and contact with Him! You ought rather to have brought Christ down, not from heaven, but from some troop of mountebanks, not as God besides man, but simply as a man, a magician; not as the High Priest of our salvation, but as the conjurer in a show; not as the raiser of the dead, but as the misleader[fn-93-P9337_2564050:82-nf] of the living,-except that, if He were a magician, He must have had a nativity!","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Heracleon adopts a somewhat violent course when he arrives at this passage, \"What was made in Him was life.\" Instead of the \"In Him\" of the text he understands \"to those men who are spiritual,\" as if he considered the Logos and the spiritual to be identical, though this he does not plainly say; and then he proceeds to give, as it were, an account of the origin of the matter and says, \"He (the Logos) provided them with their first form at their birth, carrying further and making manifest what had been sown by another,[fn-65-P6522_1111562:55-nf] into form and into illumination and into an outline of its own.\" He did not observe how Paul speaks of the spiritual,[fn-65-P6523_1111699:56-nf] and how he refrains from saying that they are men. \"A natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; but the spiritual judgeth all things.\" We maintain that it was not without a meaning that he did not add the word men to the word spiritual.

For who hath known the mind of the Lord[fn-29-P2927_1970992:12-nf] ?\" But seeing on the other hand that that Apostle declares it to be a peculiarity of him that is spiritual to \"judge all things[fn-29-P2928_1971151:13-nf] ,\" and commends those who have been \"enriched[fn-29-P2929_1971217:14-nf] \" by the Divine grace \"in all utterance and in all knowledge,\" I venture to assert that it is not right to omit the examination which is within the range of our ability, nor to leave the question here raised without making any inquiries, or having any ideas about it; lest, like the actual subject of our proposed discussion, this essay should have an ineffectual ending, spoilt before its maturity by the fatal indolence of those who will not nerve themselves to search out the truth, like a new-born infant ere it sees the light and acquires any strength. I assert, too, that it is not well at once to confront and meet objections, as if we were pleading in court, but to introduce a certain order into the discussion and to lead the view on from one point to another. What, then, should this order be? First, we want to know the whence of human nature, and the wherefore of its ever having come into existence. If we hit the answer to these questions, we shall not fail in getting the required explanation. Now, that everything that exists, after God, in the intellectual or sensible world of beings owes that existence to Him, is a proposition which it is superfluous to prove; no one, with however little insight into the truth of things, would gainsay it. For every one agrees that the Universe is linked to one First Cause; that nothing in it owes its existence to itself, so as to be its own origin and cause; but that there is on the other hand a single uncreate eternal Essence, the same for ever, which transcends all our ideas of distance, conceived of as without increase or decrease, and beyond the scope of any definition; and that time and space with all their consequences, and anything previous to these that thought can grasp in the intelligible supramundane world, are all the productions of this Essence. Well, then, we affirm that human nature is one of these productions; and a word of the inspired Teaching helps us in this, which declares that when God had brought all things else upon the scene of life, man was exhibited upon the earth, a mixture from Divine sources, the godlike intellectual essence being in him united with the several portions of earthly elements contributed towards his formation, and that he was fashioned by his Maker to be the incarnate likeness of Divine transcendent Power. It would be better however to quote the very words: \"And God created man, in the image of God created He him[fn-29-P2930_1973672:15-nf] .\" Now the reason of the making of this animate being has been given by certain writers previous to us as follows. The whole creation is divided into two parts; that \"which is seen,\" and that \"which is not seen,\" to use the Apostle's words (the second meaning the intelligible and immaterial, the first, the sensible and material); and being thus divided, the angelic and spiritual natures, which are among \"the things not seen,\" reside in places above the world, and above the heavens, because such a residence is in correspondence with their constitution; for an intellectual nature is a fine, clear, unencumbered, agile kind of thing, and a heavenly body is fine and light, and perpetually moving, and the earth on the contrary, which stands last in the list of things sensible, can never be an adequate and congenial spot for creatures intellectual to sojourn in. For what correspondence can there possibly be between that which is light and buoyant, on the one hand, and that which is heavy and gravitating on the other? Well, in order that the earth may not be completely devoid of the local indwelling of the intellectual and the immaterial, man (these writers tell us) was fashioned by the Supreme forethought, and his earthy parts moulded over the intellectual and godlike essence of his soul; and so this amalgamation with that which has material weight enables the soul to live on this element of earth, which possesses a certain bond of kindred with the substance of the flesh. The design of all that is being born[fn-29-P2931_1975216:16-nf] , then, is that the Power which is above both the heavenly and the earthly universe may in all parts of the creation be glorified by means of intellectual natures, conspiring to the same end by virtue of the same faculty in operation in all, I mean that of looking upon God. But this operation of looking upon God is nothing less than the life-nourishment appropriate, as like to like, to an intellectual nature. For just as these bodies, earthy as they are, are preserved by nourishment that is earthy, and we detect in them all alike, whether brute or reasoning, the operations of a material kind of vitality, so it is right to assume that there is an intellectual life-nourishment as well, by which such natures[fn-29-P2932_1976033:17-nf] are maintained in existence. But if bodily food, coming and going as it does in circulation, nevertheless imparts a certain amount of vital energy to those who get it, how much more does the partaking of the real thing, always remaining and always the same, preserve the eater in existence? If, then, this is the life-nourishment of an intellectual nature, namely, to have a part in God, this part will not be gained by that which is of an opposite quality; the would-be partaker must? some degree be akin to that which is to be partaken of. The eye enjoys the light by virtue of having light within itself to seize its kindred light, and the finger or any other limb cannot effect the act of vision because none of this natural light is organized in any of them. The same necessity requires that in our partaking of God there should be some kinship in the constitution of the partaker with that which is partaken of. Therefore, as the Scripture says, man was made in the image of God; that like, I take it, might be able to see like; and to see God is, as was said above, the life of the soul. But seeing that ignorance of the true good is like a mist that obscures the visual keenness of the soul, and that when that mist grows denser a cloud is formed so thick that Truth's ray cannot pierce through these depths of ignorance, it follows further that with the total deprivation of the light the soul's life ceases altogether; for we have said that the real life of the soul is acted out in partaking of the Good; but when ignorance hinders this apprehension of God, the soul which thus ceases to partake of God, ceases also to live. But no one can force us to give the family history[fn-29-P2933_1978013:18-nf] of this ignorance, asking whence and from what father it is; let him be given to understand from the word itself that \"ignorance\" and \"knowledge\" indicate one of the relations of the soul;[fn-29-P2934_1978220:19-nf] but no relation, whether expressed or not, conveys the idea of substance; a relation and a substance are quite of different descriptions. If, then, knowledge is not a substance, but a perfected[fn-29-P2935_1978452:20-nf] operation of the soul, it must be conceded that ignorance must be much farther removed still from anything in the way of substance; but that which is not in that way does not exist at all; and so it would be useless to trouble ourselves about where it comes from. Now seeing that the Word[fn-29-P2936_1978836:21-nf] declares that the living in God is the life of the soul, and seeing that this living is knowledge according to each man's ability, and that ignorance does not imply the reality of anything, but is only the negation of the operation of knowing, and seeing that upon this partaking in God being no longer effected there follows at once the cancelling of the soul's life, which is the worst of evils,-because of all this the Producer of all Good would work in us the cure of such an evil. A cure is a good thing, but one who does not look to the evangelic mystery would still be ignorant of the manner of the cure. We have shown that alienation from God, Who is the Life, is an evil; the cure, then, of this infirmity is, again to be made friends with God, and so to be in life once more. When such a life, then, is always held up in hope before humanity, it cannot be said that the winning of this life is absolutely a reward of a good life, and that the contrary is a punishment (of a bad one); but what we insist on resembles the case of the eyes. We do not say that one who has clear eyesight is rewarded as with a prize by being able to perceive the objects of sight; nor on the other hand that he who has diseased eyes experiences a failure of optic activity as the result of some penal sentence. With the eye in a natural state sight follows necessarily; with it vitiated by disease failure of sight as necessarily follows. In the same way the life of blessedness is as a familiar second nature to those who have kept clear the senses of the soul; but when the blinding stream of ignorance prevents our partaking in the real light, then it necessarily follows that we miss that, the enjoyment of which we declare to be the life of the partaker.","title":"On Infants' Early Deaths","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_41_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Therefore, do not be sceptical, but believe; for I myself also used to disbelieve that this would take place, but now, having taken these things into consideration, I believe.

For consider that primeval sentence which God spake when He called man earth; saying, \"Earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou return.\"[fn-99-P9935_2745800:178-nf] In respect, of course, to his fleshly substance, which had been taken out of the ground, and which was the first to receive the name of man, as we have already shown,[fn-99-P9936_2745989:179-nf] does not this passage give one instruction to interpret in relation to the flesh also whatever of wrath or of grace God has determined for the earth, because, strictly speaking, the earth is not exposed to His judgment, since it has never done any good or evil? \"Cursed,\" no doubt, it was, for it drank the blood of man;[fn-99-P9937_2746335:180-nf] but even this was as a figure of homicidal flesh. For if the earth has to suffer either joy or injury, it is simply on man's account, that he may suffer the joy or the sorrow through the events which happen to his dwelling-place, whereby he will rather have to pay the penalty which, simply on his account, even the earth must suffer. When, therefore, God even threatens the earth, I would prefer saying that He threatens the flesh: so likewise, when He makes a promise to the earth, I would rather understand Him as promising the flesh; as in that passage of David: \"The Lord is King, let the earth be glad,\"[fn-99-P9938_2746965:181-nf] -meaning the flesh of the saints, to which appertains the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. Then he afterwards says: \"The earth saw and trembled; the mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord,\"-meaning, no doubt the flesh of the wicked; and (in a similar sense) it is written: \"For they shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-99-P9939_2747322:182-nf] If indeed it will be thought that both these passages were pronounced simply of the element earth, how can it be consistent that it should shake and melt at the presence of the Lord, at whose royal dignity it before exulted? So again in Isaiah, \"Ye shall eat the good of the land,\"[fn-99-P9940_2747626:183-nf] the expression means the blessings which await the flesh when in the kingdom of God it shall be renewed, and made like the angels, and waiting to obtain the things \"which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, and which have not entered into the heart of man.\"[fn-99-P9941_2747905:184-nf] Otherwise, how vain that God should invite men to obedience by the fruits of the field and the elements of this life, when He dispenses these to even irreligious men and blasphemers; on a general condition once for all made to man, \"sending rain on the good and on the evil, and making His sun to shine on the just and on the unjust!\"[fn-99-P9942_2748261:185-nf] Happy, no doubt, is faith, if it is to obtain gifts which the enemies of God and Christ not only use, but even abuse, \"worshipping the creature itself in opposition to the Creator!\"[fn-99-P9943_2748463:186-nf] You will reckon, (I suppose) onions and truffles among earth's bounties, since the Lord declares that \"man shall not live on bread alone!\"[fn-99-P9944_2748621:187-nf] In this way the Jews lose heavenly blessings, by confining their hopes to earthly ones, being ignorant of the promise of heavenly bread, and of the oil of God's unction, and the wine of the Spirit, and of that water of life which has its vigour from the vine of Christ. On exactly the same principle, they consider the special soil of Judµa to be that very holy land, which ought rather to be interpreted of the Lord's flesh, which, in all those who put on Christ, is thenceforward the holy land; holy indeed by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, truly flowing with milk and honey by the sweetness of His assurance, truly Judµan by reason of the friendship of God. For \"he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, but he who is one inwardly.\"[fn-99-P9945_2749379:188-nf] In the same way it is that both God's temple and Jerusalem (must be understood) when it is said by Isaiah: \"Awake, awake, O Jerusalem! put on the strength of thine arm; awake, as in thine earliest time,\"[fn-99-P9946_2749607:189-nf] that is to say, in that innocence which preceded the fall into sin. For how can words of this kind of exhortation andinvitation be suitable for that Jerusalem which killed the prophets, and stoned those that were sent to them, and at last crucified its very Lord? Neither indeed is salvation promised to any one land at all, which must needs pass away with the fashion of the whole world. Even if anybody should venture strongly to contend that paradise is the holy land, which it may be possible to designate as the land of our first parents Adam and Eve, it will even then follow that the restoration of paradise will seem to be promised to the flesh, whose lot it was to inhabit and keep it, in order that man may be recalled thereto just such as he was driven from it.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"45.

The fact is, heresy has rather taken it from Truth, in order to mould it into its own counterfeit. Was the Word of God put forth or not? Here take your stand with me, and flinch not. If He was put forth, then acknowledge that the true doctrine has a prolation;[fn-104-P10483_2937443:82-nf] and never mind heresy, when in any point it mimics the truth. The question now is, in what sense each side uses a given thing and the word which expresses it. Valentinus divides and separates his prolations from their Author, and places them at so great a distance from Him, that the ¦on does not know the Father: he longs, indeed, to know Him, but cannot; nay, he is almost swallowed up and dissolved into the rest of matter.[fn-104-P10484_2937885:83-nf] With us, however, the Son alone knows the Father,[fn-104-P10485_2937972:84-nf] and has Himself unfolded \"the Father's bosom.\"[fn-104-P10486_2938038:85-nf] He has also heard and seen all things with the Father; and what He has been commanded by the Father, that also does He speak.[fn-104-P10487_2938181:86-nf] And it is not His own will, but the Father's, which He has accomplished,[fn-104-P10488_2938274:87-nf] which He had known most intimately, even from the beginning. \"For what man knoweth the things which be in God, but the Spirit which is in Him? \"[fn-104-P10489_2938437:88-nf] But the Word was formed by the Spirit, and (if I may so express myself) the Spirit is the body of the Word. The Word, therefore, is both always in the Father, as He says, \"I am in the Father; \"[fn-104-P10490_2938651:89-nf] and is always with God, according to what is written, \"And the Word was with God; \"[fn-104-P10491_2938754:90-nf] and never separate from the Father, or other than the Father, since \"I and the Father are one.\"[fn-104-P10492_2938866:91-nf] This will be the prolation, taught by the truth,[fn-104-P10493_2938932:92-nf] the guardian of the Unity, wherein we declare that the Son is a prolation from the Father, without being separated from Him. For God sent forth the Word, as the Paraclete also declares, just as the root puts forth the tree, and the fountain the river, and the sun the ray.[fn-104-P10494_2939251:93-nf] For these are probolai/, or emanations, of the substances from which they proceed. I should not hesitate, indeed, to call the tree the son or offspring of the root, and the river of the fountain, and the ray of the sun; because every original source is a parent, and everything which issues from the origin is an offspring. Much more is (this true of) the Word of God, who has actually received as His own peculiar designation the name of Son. But still the tree is not severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun; nor, indeed, is the Word separated from God. Following, therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess that I call God and His Word-the Father and His Son-two. For the root and the tree are distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the river are also two forms, but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything which proceeds from something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds, without being on that account separated: Where, however, there is a second, there must be two; and where there is a third, there must be three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from God and the Son; just as the fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun. Nothing, however, is alien from that original source whence it derives its own properties. In like manner the Trinity, flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected steps, does not at all disturb the Monarchy,[fn-104-P10495_2940894:94-nf] whilst it at the same time guards the state of the Economy.[fn-104-P10496_2940992:95-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But this very declaration of His they will hastily pervert into an argument of His singleness. \"I have,\" says He, \"stretched out the heaven alone.\" Undoubtedly alone as regards all other powers; and He thus gives a premonitory evidence against the conjectures of the heretics, who maintain that the world was constructed by various angels and powers, who also make the Creator Himself to have been either an angel or some subordinate agent sent to form external things, such as the constituent parts of the world, but who was at the same time ignorant of the divine purpose. If, now, it is in this sense that He stretches out the heavens alone, how is it that these heretics assume their position so perversely, as to render inadmissible the singleness of that Wisdom which says, \"When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him? \"[fn-106-P10657_2995058:223-nf] -even though the apostle asks, \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-106-P10658_2995185:224-nf] meaning, of course, to except that wisdom which was present with Him.[fn-106-P10659_2995275:225-nf] In Him, at any rate, and with Him, did (Wisdom) construct the universe, He not being ignorant of what she was making. \"Except Wisdom,\" however, is a phrase of the same sense exactly as \"except the Son,\" who is Christ, \"the Wisdom and Power of God,\"[fn-106-P10660_2995547:226-nf] according to the apostle, who only knows the mind of the Father. \"For who knoweth the things that be in God, except the Spirit which is in Him? \"[fn-106-P10661_2995714:227-nf] Not, observe, without Him. There was therefore One who caused God to be not alone, except \"alone\" from all other gods. But (if we are to follow the heretics), the Gospel itself will have to be rejected, because it tells us that all things were made by God through the Word, without whom nothing was made.[fn-106-P10662_2996040:228-nf] And if I am not mistaken, there is also another passage in which it is written: \"By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hosts of them by His Spirit.\"[fn-106-P10663_2996228:229-nf] Now this Word, the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, must be the very Son of God. So that, if (He did) all things by the Son, He must have stretched out the heavens by the Son, and so not have stretched them out alone, except in the sense in which He is \"alone\" (and apart) from all other gods. Accordingly He says, concerning the Son, immediately afterwards: \"Who else is it that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad, turning wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish, and confirming the words[fn-106-P10664_2996783:230-nf] of His Son? \"[fn-106-P10665_2996819:231-nf] -as, for instance, when He said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-106-P10666_2996986:232-nf] By thus attaching the Son to Himself, He becomes His own interpreter in what sense He stretched out the heavens alone, meaning alone with His Son, even as He is one with His Son. The utterance, therefore, will be in like manner the Son's, \"I have stretched out the heavens alone,\"[fn-106-P10667_2997289:233-nf] because by the Word were the heavens established.[fn-106-P10668_2997361:234-nf] Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when Wisdom was present in the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because He alone ministered to the Father's work. It must also be He who says, \"I am the First, and to all futurity I AM.\"[fn-106-P10669_2997707:235-nf] The Word, no doubt, was before all things. \"In the beginning was the Word; \"[fn-106-P10670_2997811:236-nf] and in that beginning He was sent forth[fn-106-P10671_2997869:237-nf] by the Father. The Father, however, has no beginning, as proceeding from none; nor can He be seen, since He was not begotten. He who has always been alone could never have had order or rank. Therefore, if they have determined that the Father and the Son must be regarded as one and the same, for the express purpose of vindicating the unity of God, that unity of His is preserved intact; for He is one, and yet He has a Son, who is equally with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures. Since they are unwilling to allow that the Son is a distinct Person, second from the Father, lest, being thus second, He should cause two Gods to be spoken of, we have shown above[fn-106-P10672_2998556:238-nf] that Two are actually described in Scripture as God and Lord. And to prevent their being offended at this fact, we give a reason why they are not said to be two Gods and two Lords, but that they are two as Father and Son; and this not by severance of their substance, but from the dispensation wherein we declare the Son to be undivided and inseparable from the Father,-distinct in degree, not in state. And although, when named apart, He is called God, He does not thereby constitute two Gods, but one; and that from the very circumstance that He is entitled to be called God, from His union with the Father.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"135","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"It is no wonder that light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.[fn-62-P6232_2400037:230-nf] In John's Epistle the Light declares,\" Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\"[fn-62-P6233_2400198:231-nf] And in the Pelagian writings the darkness says, \"Love comes to us of our own selves.\" Now, if they only possessed the true, that is, Christian love, they would also know whence they obtained possession of it; even as the apostle knew when he said, \"But we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-62-P6234_2400618:232-nf] John says, \"God is love.\"[fn-62-P6235_2400666:233-nf] And thus the Pelagians affirm that they actually have God Himself, not from God, but from their own selves! and although they allow that we have the knowledge of the law from God, they will yet have it that love is from our very selves.

Some indeed of our predecessors have observed, that in the New Testament, whenever the Spirit is named without that adjunct which denotes quality, the Holy Spirit is to be understood; as e.g., in the expression, \"Now the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and peace; \"[fn-63-P6343_1160502:65-nf] and, \"Seeing ye began in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the flesh? \"[fn-63-P6344_1160597:66-nf] We are of opinion that this distinction may be observed in the Old Testament also, as when it is said, \"He that giveth His Spirit to the people who are upon the earth, and Spirit to them who walk thereon.\"[fn-63-P6345_1160821:67-nf] For, · without doubt, every one who walks upon the earth (i.e., earthly and corporeal beings) is a partaker also of the Holy Spirit, receiving it from God. My Hebrew master also used to say that those two seraphim in Isaiah, which are described as having each six wings, and calling to one another, and saying, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Loan God of hosts,\"[fn-63-P6346_1161197:68-nf] were to be understood of the only-begotten Son of God and of the Holy Spirit. And we think that that expression also which occurs in the hymn of Habakkuk, \"In the midst either of the two living things, or of the two lives, Thou wilt be known,\"[fn-63-P6347_1161458:69-nf] ought to be understood of Christ and of the Holy Spirit. For all knowledge of the Father is obtained by revelation of the Son through the Holy Spirit, so that both of these beings which, according to the prophet, are called either \"living things\" or \"lives,\" exist as the ground of the knowledge of God the Father. For as it is said of the Son, that \"no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him,\"[fn-63-P6348_1161907:70-nf] the same also is said by the apostle of the Holy Spirit, when He declares, \"God hath revealed them to us by His Holy Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God; \"[fn-63-P6349_1162117:71-nf] and again in the Gospel, when the Saviour, speaking of the divine and profounder parts of His teaching, which His disciples were not yet able to receive, thus addresses them: \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; but when the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is come, He will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-63-P6350_1162543:72-nf] We must understand, therefore, that as the Son, who alone knows the Father, reveals Him to whom He will, so the Holy Spirit, who alone searches the deep things of God, reveals God to whom He will: \"For the Spirit bloweth where He listeth.\"[fn-63-P6351_1162823:73-nf] We are not, however, to suppose that the Spirit derives His knowledge through revelation from the Son. For if the Holy Spirit knows the Father through the Son's revelation, He passes from a state of ignorance into one of knowledge; but it is alike impious and foolish to confess the Holy Spirit, and yet to ascribe to Him ignorance. For even although something else existed before the Holy Spirit, it was not by progressive advancement that He came to be the Holy Spirit; as if any one should venture to say, that at the time when He was not yet the Holy Spirit He was ignorant of the Father, but that after He had received knowledge He was made the Holy Spirit. For if this were the case, the Holy Spirit would never be reckoned in the Unity of the Trinity, i.e., along with the unchangeable Father and His Son, unless He had always been the Holy Spirit. When we use, indeed, such terms as \"always\" or \"was,\" or any other designation of time, they are not to be taken absolutely, but with due allowance; for while the significations of these words relate to time, and those subjects of which we speak are spoken of by a stretch of language as existing in time, they nevertheless surpass in their real nature all conception of the finite understanding.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_38_oration_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2.

For if God is not ignorant of anything that is, and yet man is in the midst of evil, the argument for the goodness of God could not be upheld; that is, if He brought forth into life the man who was to be in this evil. For if the operating force which is in accordance with the good is entirely that of a nature which is good, then this painful and perishing life, they say, can never be referred to the workmanship of the good, but it is necessary to suppose for such a life as this another author, from whom our nature derives its tendency to misery. Now all these and the like assertions seem to those who are thoroughly imbued with the heretical fraud, as with some deeply ingrained stain, to have a certain force from their superficial plausibility. But they who have a more thorough insight into the truth clearly perceive that what they say is unsound, and admits of speedy demonstration of its fallacy. In my opinion, too, it is well to put forward the Apostle as pleading with us on these points for their condemnation. In his address to the Corinthians he makes a distinction between the carnal and spiritual dispositions of souls; showing, I think, by what he says that it is wrong to judge of what is morally excellent, or, on the other hand, of what is evil, by the standard of the senses; but that, by withdrawing the mind from bodily phenomena, we must decide by itself and from itself the true nature of moral excellence and of its opposite. \"The spiritual man,\" he says, \"judgeth all things[fn-38-P3881_2557226:27-nf] .\" This, I think, must have been the reason of the invention of these deceptive doctrines on the part of those who propound them, viz. that when they define the good they have an eye only to the sweetness of the body's enjoyment, and so, because from its composite nature and constant tendency to dissolution that body is unavoidably subject to suffering and sicknesses, and because upon such conditions of suffering there follows a sort of sense of pain, they decree that the formation of man is the work of an evil deity. Since, if their thoughts had taken a loftier view, and, withdrawing their minds from this disposition to regard the gratifications of the senses, they had looked at the nature of existing things dispassionately, they would have understood that there is no evil other than wickedness. Now all wickedness has its form and character in the deprivation of the good; it exists not by itself, and cannot be contemplated as a subsistence. For no evil of any kind lies outside and independent of the will; but it is the non-existence of the good that is so denominated. Now that which is not has no substantial existence, and the Maker of that which has no substantial existence is not the Maker of things that have substantial existence. Therefore the God of things that are is external to the causation of things that are evil, since He is not the Maker of things that are non-existent. He Who formed the sight did not make blindness. He Who manifested virtue manifested not the deprivation thereof. He Who has proposed as the prize in the contest of a free will the guerdon of all good to those who are living virtuously, never, to please Himself, subjected mankind to the yoke of a strong compulsion, as if he would drag it unwilling, as it were his lifeless tool, towards the right. But if, when the light shines very brightly in a clear sky, a man of his own accord shuts his eyelids to shade his sight, the sun is clear of blame on the part of him who sees not.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"153","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"It will be necessary to add to what has been said this remaining statement also; viz. that those good things which are held out in the Gospels to those who have led a godly life, are not such as can be precisely described.

I was already living in a monastery, where, as both he and all others know, about 30 years ago, I was made regenerate by Baptism, and received the seal of the faith at the hands of those saintly men, Chromatius,[fn-86-P8611_2143337:7-nf] Jovinus[fn-86-P8612_2143553:8-nf] and Eusebius,[fn-86-P8613_2143632:9-nf] all of them now bishops, well-tried and highly esteemed in the church of God, one of whom was then a presbyter of the church under Valerian of blessed memory, the second was archdeacon, the third Deacon, and to me a spiritual father, my teacher in the creed and the articles of belief. These men so taught me, and so I believe, namely, that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are of one Godhead, of one Substance: a Trinity coeternal, inseparable, incorporeal, invisible, incomprehensible, known to itself alone as it truly is in its perfection: For \"No man[fn-86-P8614_2144298:10-nf] knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father but the Son\": and the Holy Spirit is he who \"searcheth[fn-86-P8615_2144439:11-nf] the deep thingsof God\": that this Trinity, therefore, is without all bodily visibility, but that it is with the eye of the understanding that the Son and the Holy Spirit see the Father even as the Father sees the Son and the Holy Spirit; and further, that in this Trinity there is no diversity except that one is Father, another Son and a third Holy Spirit. There is a Trinity as touching the distinction of persons, a unity in the reality of the Substance. We received, further, that the only begotten Son of God, through whom in the beginning all existing things were made, whether visible or invisible, in these last days took upon him a human body and Soul, and was made man, and suffered for our salvation; and the third day he rose again from the dead in that very flesh which had been laid in the sepulchre; and in that very same flesh made glorious he ascended into the heavens, whence we look for his coming to judge the quick and the dead. But further we confess that he gave us hope that we too should rise in a similar manner, so that we believe that our resurrection will be in the same manner and process, and in the same form, as the resurrection of our Lord himself from the dead: that the bodies which we shall receive will not be phantoms or thin vapours, as some slanderously affirm that we say, but these very bodies of ours in which we live and in which we die. For how can we truly believe in the resurrection of the flesh, unless the very nature of flesh remains in it truly and substantially? It is then without any equivocation, that we confess the resurrection of this real and substantial flesh of ours in which we live.","title":"Book I.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Let us now look also to the New Testament, where Satan approaches the Saviour, and tempts Him: wherein also it is stated that evil spirits and unclean demons, which had taken possession of very many, were expelled by the Saviour from the bodies of the sufferers, who are said also to be made free by Him.

But now, since we are treating of the manner in which the opposing powers stir up those contests, by means of which false knowledge is introduced into the minds of men, and human souls led astray, while they imagine that they have discovered wisdom, I think it necessary to name and distinguish the wisdom of this world, and of the princes of this world, that by so doing we may discover who are the fathers of this wisdom, nay, even of these kinds of wisdom.[fn-71-P7178_1590154:320-nf] I am of opinion, therefore, as I have stated above, that there is another wisdom of this world besides those (different kinds of) wisdom[fn-71-P7179_1590318:321-nf] which belong to the princes of this world, by which wisdom those things seem to be understood and comprehended which belong to this world. This wisdom, however, possesses in itself no fitness for forming any opinion either respecting divine things,[fn-71-P7180_1590592:322-nf] or the plan of the world's government, or any other subjects of importance, or regarding the training for a good or happy life; but is such as deals wholly with the art of poetry, e.g., or that of grammar, or rhetoric, or geometry, or music, with which also, perhaps, medicine should be classed. In all these subjects we are to suppose that the wisdom of this world is included. The wisdom of the princes of this world, on the other hand, we understand to be such as the secret and occult philosophy, as they call it, of the Egyptians, and the astrology of the Chaldeans and Indians, who make profession of the knowledge of high things,[fn-71-P7181_1591251:323-nf] and also that manifold variety of opinion which prevails among the Greeks regarding divine things. Accordingly, in the holy Scriptures we find that there are princes over individual nations; as in Daniel[fn-71-P7182_1591496:324-nf] we read that there was a prince of the kingdom of Persia, and another prince of the kingdom of Graecia, who are clearly shown, by the nature of the passage, to be not human beings, but certain powers. In the prophecies of Ezekiel,[fn-71-P7183_1591746:325-nf] also, the prince of Tyre is unmistakeably shown to be a kind of spiritual power. When these, then, and others of the same kind, possessing each his own wisdom, and building up his own opinions and sentiments, beheld our Lord and Saviour professing and declaring that He had for this purpose come into the world, that all the opinions of science, falsely so called, might be destroyed, not knowing what was concealed within Him, they forthwith laid a snare for Him: for \"the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers assembled together, against the Lord and His Christ.\"[fn-71-P7184_1592347:326-nf] But their snares being discovered, and the plans which they had attempted to carry out being made manifest when they crucified the Lord of glory, therefore the apostle says, \"We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, but not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, who are brought to nought, which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-71-P7185_1592799:327-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-04","text":"4.

To take, for example, this requirement on which Faustus ignorantly grounds his charge against the Old Testament, that a man should take his brother's wife to raise up seed for his brother, to be called by his name; what does this prefigure, but that every preacher of the gospel should so labor in the Church as to raise up seed to his deceased brother, that is, Christ, who died for us, and that this seed should bear His name? Moreover, the apostle fulfills this requirement not now in the typical observance, but in the spiritual reality, when he reproves those of whom he says that he had begotten them in Christ Jesus by the gospel,[fn-24-P2491_1507695:16-nf] and points out to them their error in wishing to be of Paul. \"Was Paul,\" he says, \"crucified for you?

For \"He was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" We have proof also that He leads into all truth, for the only way to truth is by love, and \"the love of God,\" says the apostle, \"is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given unto us.\"[fn-25-P2523_1524701:40-nf] We show, too, that in the words, \"when that which is perfect is come,\" Paul spoke of the perfection in the enjoyment of eternal life.

For although, in His Gospel, He is reasoning for the purpose of giving to men an increase of intelligence, nevertheless He Himself speaks to men concerning God, in such a way as they can as yet hear and receive; although, as we have said, He is now endeavouring to give to His hearers religious additions to their knowledge of God. For we find it to be written that God is called Love, and yet from this the substance of God is not declared to be Love; and that He is called Light, while in this is not the substance of God. But the whole that is thus said of God is as much as can be said, so that reasonably also, when He is called a Spirit, it is not all that He is which is so called; but so that, while men's mind by understanding makes progress even to the Spirit itself, being already changed in spirit, it may conjecture God to be something even greater through the Spirit. For that which is, according to what it is, can neither be declared by human discourse, nor received by human ears, nor gathered by human perceptions. For if \"the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him, neither eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, nor the heart of man, nor even his mind has perceived; \"[fn-101-P10147_3155564:37-nf] what and how great is He Himself who promises these things, in understanding which both the mind and nature of man have failed!

In which manner also, if, according to Moses, you should receive God to be fire, in saying that He is a creature, you will have declared what is ordained, you will not have taught who is its ordainer. But these things are rather used as figures than as being so in fact. For as, in the Old Testament,[fn-101-P10148_3156174:38-nf] God is for this reason called Fire, that fear may be struck into the hearts of a sinful people, by suggesting to them a Judge; so in the New Testament He is announced as Spirit, that, as the Renewer and Creator of those who are dead in their sins, He may be attested by this goodness of mercy granted to those that believe.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Moreover, the order of reason, and the authority of the faith in the disposition of the words and in the Scriptures of the Lord, admonish us after these things to believe also on the Holy Spirit, once promised to the Church, and in the appointed occasions of times given. For He was promised by Joel the prophet, but given by Christ. \"In the last days,\" says the prophet, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and my handmaids.\"[fn-104-P10421_3281470:243-nf] And the Lord said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye remit, they shall be remitted; and whose ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-104-P10422_3281643:244-nf] But this Holy Spirit the Lord Christ calls at one time \"the Paraclete,\" at another pronounces to be the \"Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10423_3281790:245-nf] And He is not new in the Gospel, nor yet even newly given; for it was He Himself who accused the people in the prophets, and in the apostles gave them the appeal to the Gentiles. For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord's resurrection, but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, \"I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10425_3283345:247-nf] And, \"When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.\"[fn-104-P10426_3283506:248-nf] And, \"If I go not away, that Advocate shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.\"[fn-104-P10427_3283631:249-nf] And, \"When the Spirit of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.\"[fn-104-P10428_3283735:250-nf] And because the Lord was about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as not to leave them in any degree orphans,[fn-104-P10429_3283918:251-nf] which was little desirable, and forsake them without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit. For our bodies are both trained in Him and by Him to advance to immortality, by learning to govern themselves with moderation according to His decrees. For this is He who \"desireth against the flesh,\" because \"the flesh resisteth against the Spirit.\"[fn-104-P10435_3287195:257-nf] This is He who restrains insatiable desires, controls immoderate lusts, quenches unlawful fires, conquers reckless impulses, repels drunkenness, checks avarice, drives away luxurious revellings, links love, binds together affections, keeps down sects, orders the rule of truth, overcomes heretics, turns out the wicked, guards the Gospel, Of this says the same apostle: \"We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God.\"[fn-104-P10436_3287665:258-nf] Concerning Him he exultingly says: \"And I think also that I have the Spirit of God.\"[fn-104-P10437_3287773:259-nf] Of Him he says: \"The Spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets.\"[fn-104-P10438_3287870:260-nf] Of Him also he tells: \"Now the Spirit speaketh plainly, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, who speak lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience cauterized.\"[fn-104-P10439_3288127:261-nf] Established in this Spirit, \"none ever calleth Jesus anathema; \"[fn-104-P10440_3288214:262-nf] no one has ever denied Christ to be the Son of God, or has rejected God the Creator; no one utters any words of his own contrary to the Scriptures; no one ordains other and sacrilegious decrees; no one draws up different laws.[fn-104-P10441_3288464:263-nf] Whosoever shall blaspheme against Him, \"hath not forgiveness, not only in this world, but also not in the world to come.\"[fn-104-P10442_3288722:264-nf] This is He who in the apostles gives testimony to Christ; in the martyrs shows forth the constant faithfulness of their religion; in virgins restrains the admirable continency of their sealed chastity; in others, guards the laws of the Lord's doctrine incorrupt and uncontaminated; destroys heretics, corrects the perverse, condemns infidels, makes known pretenders; moreover, rebukes the wicked, keeps the Church uncorrupt and inviolate, in the sanctity of a perpetual virginity and truth.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_135_homily_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5.

It is manifest to us all who possess the Gospel narratives, which Celsus does not appear even to have read, that Jesus selected twelve apostles, and that of these Matthew alone was a tax-gatherer; that when he calls them indiscriminately sailors, he probably means James and John, because they left their ship and their father Zebedee, and followed Jesus; for Peter and his brother Andrew, who employed a net to gain their necessary subsistence, must be classed not as sailors, but as the Scripture describes them, as fishermen. The Lebes[fn-79-P7940_1919782:115-nf] also, who was a follower of Jesus, may have been a tax-gatherer; but he was not of the number of the apostles, except according to a statement in one of the copies of Mark's Gospel.[fn-79-P7941_1919979:116-nf] And we have not ascertained the employments of the remaining disciples, by which they earned their livelihood before becoming disciples of Jesus. I assert, therefore, in answer to such statements as the above, that it is clear to all who are able to institute an intelligent and candid examination into the history of the apostles of Jesus, that it was by help of a divine power that these men taught Christianity, and succeeded in leading others to embrace the word of God. For it was not any power of speaking, or any orderly arrangement of their message, according to the arts of Grecian dialectics or rhetoric, which was in them the effective cause of converting their hearers. Nay, I am of opinion that if Jesus had selected some individuals who were wise according to the apprehension of the multitude, and who were fitted both to think and speak so as to please them, and had used such as the ministers of His doctrine, He would most justly have been suspected of employing artifices, like those philosophers who are the leaders of certain sects, and consequently the promise respecting the divinity of His doctrine would not have manifested itself; for had the doctrine and the preaching consisted in the persuasive utterance and arrangement of words, then faith also, like that of the philosophers of the world in their opinions, would have been through the wisdom of men, and not through the power of God. Now, who is there on seeing fishermen and tax-gatherers, who had not acquired even the merest elements of learning (as the Gospel relates of them, and in respect to which Celsus believes that they speak the truth, inasmuch as it is their own ignorance which they record), discoursing boldly not only among the Jews of faith in Jesus, but also preaching Him with success among other nations, would not inquire whence they derived this power of persuasion, as theirs was certainly not the common method followed by the multitude? And who would not say that the promise, \"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men,\"[fn-79-P7942_1922053:117-nf] had been accomplished by Jesus in the history of His apostles by a sort of divine power? And to this also, Paul, referring in terms of commendation, as we have stated a little above, says: \"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\"[fn-79-P7943_1922470:118-nf] For, according to the predictions in the prophets, foretelling the preaching of the Gospel, \"the Lord gave the word in great power to them who preached it, even the King of the powers of the Beloved,\"[fn-79-P7944_1922699:119-nf] in order that the prophecy might be fulfilled which said, \"His words shall run very swiftly.\"[fn-79-P7945_1922831:120-nf] And we see that \"the voice of the apostles of Jesus has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world,\"[fn-79-P7946_1922983:121-nf] On this account are they who hear the word powerfully proclaimed filled with power, which they manifest both by their dispositions and their lives, and by struggling even to death on behalf of the truth; while some are altogether empty, although they profess to believe in God through Jesus, inasmuch as, not possessing any divine power, they have the appearance only of being converted to the word of God. And although I have previously mentioned a Gospel declaration uttered by the Saviour, I shall nevertheless quote it again, as appropriate to the present occasion, as it confirms both the divine manifestation of our Saviour's foreknowledge regarding the preaching of His Gospel, and the power of His word, which without the aid of teachers gains the mastery over those who yield their assent to persuasion accompanied with divine power; and the words of Jesus referred to are, \"The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.\"[fn-79-P7947_1924035:122-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_138_homily_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1.

And he changes the words in the expression, \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me,\" and does not give what follows immediately after, which manifests at once the ready obedience of Jesus to His Father, and His greatness of mind, and which runs thus: \"Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-81-P8144_2013807:72-nf] Nay, even the cheerful obedience of Jesus to the will of His Father in those things which He was condemned to suffer, exhibited in the declaration, \"If this cup cannot pass from Me except I drink it, Thy will be done,\" he pretends not to have observed, acting here like those wicked individuals who listen to the Holy Scriptures in a malignant spirit, and \"who talk wickedness with lofty head.\" For they appear to have heard the declaration, \"I kill,\"[fn-81-P8145_2014280:73-nf] and they often make it to us a subject of reproach; but the words, \"I will make alive,\" they do not remember,-the whole sentence showing that those who live amid public wickedness, and who work wickedly, are put to death by God, and that a better life is infused into them instead, even one which God will give to those who have died to sin. And so also these men have heard the words, \"I will smite; \"but they do not see these, \"and I will heal,\" which are like the words of a physician, who cuts bodies asunder, and inflicts severe wounds, in order to extract from them substances that are injurious and prejudicial to health, and who does not terminate his work with pains and lacerations, but by his treatment restores the body to that state of soundness which he has in view. Moreover, they have not heard the whole of the announcement, \"For He maketh sore, and again bindeth up; \"but only this part, \"He maketh sore.\" So in like manner acts this Jew of Celsus who quotes the words, \"O Father, would that this cup might pass from Me; \"but who does not add what follows, and which exhibits the firmness of Jesus, and His preparedness for suffering.

Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed?\"[fn-40-P4021_1730728:124-nf] These then, that is, Paul and Apollos, agreed together in the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace; and yet because the Corinthians began to divide them among themselves, and \"to be puffed up for one against another,\" they are said to be men-carnal and natural men, not able to receive the things of the Spirit of God; and yet because they are not separated from the Church, they are called \"babes in Christ;\" for indeed he desired that they should be either Angels, or even Gods, whom he reproved because they were men, that is, in those contentions, \"They savoured not the things which be of God, but the things which be of men.\"[fn-40-P4022_1731390:125-nf] But of those who are separated from the Church it is not merely said, \"perceiving not the things of the Spirit of God,\" lest it should be referred to the perception of knowledge; but it is said, \"Having not the Spirit.\" For it does not follow, that he who hath it, should also by knowledge perceive what he hath.","title":"Sermon XXI.

Nor is it material, when we are considering the question of the genuineness and holiness of the sacrament, \"what the recipient of the sacrament believes, and with what faith he is imbued.\" It is of the very highest consequence as regards the entrance into salvation, but is wholly immaterial as regards the question of the sacrament. For it is quite possible that a man may be possessed of the genuine sacrament and a corrupted faith, as it is possible that he may hold the words of the creed in their integrity, and yet entertain an erroneous belief about the Trinity, or the resurrection, or any other point. For it is no slight matter, even within the Catholic Church itself, to hold a faith entirely consistent with the truth about even God Himself, to say nothing of any of His creatures. Is it then to be maintained, that if any one who has been baptized within the Catholic Church itself should afterwards, in the course of reading, or by listening to instruction, or by quiet argument, find out, through God's own revelation, that he had before believed otherwise than he ought, it is requisite that he should therefore be baptized afresh? But what carnal and natural man is there who does not stray through the vain conceits[fn-33-P3343_1922344:26-nf] of his own heart, and picture God's nature to himself to be such as he has imagined out of his carnal sense, and differ from the true conception of God as far as vanity from truth? Most truly, indeed, speaks the apostle, filled with the light of truth: \"The natural man,\" says he, \"receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.\"[fn-33-P3344_1922692:27-nf] And yet herein he was speaking of men whom he himself shows to have been baptized. For he says to them, \"Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\"[fn-33-P3345_1922886:28-nf] These men had therefore the sacrament of baptism; and yet, inasmuch as their wisdom was of the flesh, what could they believe about God otherwise than according to the perception of their flesh, according to which \"the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God?\" To such he says: \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meal: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.\"[fn-33-P3346_1923438:29-nf] For such are carried about with every wind of doctrine, of which kind he says, \"That we be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.\"[fn-33-P3347_1923634:30-nf] It is then true that, if these men shall have advanced even to the spiritual age of the inner man, and in the integrity of understanding shall have learned how far different from the requirements of the truth has been the belief which they have been led by the fallacious character of their conceits to entertain of God, they are therefore to be baptized again? For, on this principle, it would be possible for a Catholic catechumen to light upon the writings of some heretic, and, not having the knowledge requisite for discerning truth from error, he might entertain some belief contrary to the Catholic faith, yet not condemned by the words of the creed, just as, under color of the same words, innumerable heretical errors have sprung up. Supposing, then, that the catechumen was under the impression that he was studying the work of some great and learned Catholic, and was baptized with that belief in the Catholic Church, and by subsequent research should discover what he ought to believe, so that, embracing the Catholic faith, he should reject his former error, ought he, on confessing this, to be baptized again? Or supposing that, before learning and confessing this for himself, he should be found to entertain such an opinion, and should be taught what he ought to reject and what he should believe, and it were to become clear that he had held this false belief when he was baptized, ought he therefore to be baptized again? Why should we maintain the contrary? Because the sanctity of the sacrament, consecrated in the words of the gospel, remains upon him in, its integrity, just as he received it from the hands of the minister, although he, being firmly rooted in the vanity of his carnal mind entertained a belief other than was right at the time when he was baptized. Wherefore it is manifest that it is possible that, with defective faith, the sacrament of baptism may yet remain without defect in any man; and therefore all that is said about the diversity of the several heretics is beside the question. For in each person that is to be corrected which is found to be amiss by the man who undertakes his correction. That is to be made whole which is unsound; that is to be given which is wanting, and, above all, the peace of Christian charity, without which the rest is profitless. Yet, as the rest is there, we must not administer it as though it were wanting, only take care that its possession be to the profit, not the hurt of him who has it, through the very bond of peace and excellence of charity.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"23. \"As my Father hath sent me,\" says our Lord, \"even so send I you.

But the peace of this unity exists only in the good, in those who are either already spiritual, or are advancing by the obedience of concord to spiritual things; it exists not in the bad, whether they make disturbances abroad, or are endured within the Church with lamentations, baptizing and being baptized. But just as those who are tolerated with groanings within the Church, although they do not belong to the same unity of the dove, and to that \"glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,\"[fn-33-P3377_1935757:48-nf] yet if they are corrected, and confess that they approached to baptism most unworthily, are not baptized again, but begin to belong to the dove, through whose groans those sins are remitted which were retained in them who were estranged from her peace; so those also who are more openly without the Church, if they have received the same sacraments, are not freed from their sins on coming, after correction, to the unity of the Church, by a repetition of baptism, but by the same law of charity and bond of unity. For if \"those only may baptize who are set over the Church, and established by the law of the gospel and ordination as appointed by the Lord,\" were they in any wise of this kind who seized on estates by treacherous frauds, and increased their gains by compound interest? I trow not, since those are established by ordination as appointed of the Lord, of whom the apostle, in giving them a standard, says, \"Not greedy, not given to filthy lucre.\"[fn-33-P3378_1936781:49-nf] Yet men of this kind used to baptize in the time of Cyprian himself; and he confesses with many lamentations that they were his fellow-bishops, and endures them with the great reward of tolerance. Yet did they not confer remission of sins, which is granted through the prayers of the saints, that is, the groans of the dove, whoever it be that baptizes, if those to whom it is given belong to her peace. For the Lord would not say to robbers and usurers, \"Whose soever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted to him; and whose soever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\" \"Outside the Church, indeed, nothing can be either bound or loosed, since there there is no one who can either bind or loose;\" but he is loosed who has made peace with the dove, and he is bound who is not at peace with the dove, whether he is openly without, or appears to be within.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_58_book_i","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"ANF-01","text":"3.

For many carnal and natural men are baptized even within the Church, as the apostle expressly says: \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God;\"[fn-35-P3563_2002114:104-nf] and after they had received baptism, he says that they \"are yet carnal.\"[fn-35-P3564_2002209:105-nf] But according to it carnal sense, a soul given up to fleshly appetites cannot entertain but fleshly wisdom about God.

Wherefore even the heretic, who is manifestly without, if he has there received baptism as ordained in the gospel, has certainly not received baptism of a kind corresponding to the error which blinds him. And therefore, in returning into the way of wisdom he perceives that he ought to relinquish what he has held amiss, he must not at the same time give up the good which he had received; nor because his error is to be condemned, is the baptism of Christ in him to be therefore extinguished. For it is already sufficiently clear, from the case of those who happen to be baptized within the Church with false views about God, that the truth of the sacrament is to be distinguished from the error of him who believes amiss, although both may be found in the same man. And therefore, when any one grounded in any error, even outside the Church, has yet been baptized with the true sacrament, when he is restored to the unity of the Church, a true baptism cannot take the place of a true baptism, as a true faith takes the place of a false one, because a thing cannot take the place of itself, since neither can it give place.

It becomes us, therefore, to leave the knowledge of this matter to God, even as the Lord does of the day and hour [of judgment], and not to rush to such an extreme of danger, that we will leave nothing in the hands of God, even though we have received only a measure of grace [from Him in this world]. But when we investigate points which are above us, and with respect to which we cannot reach satisfaction, [it is absurd[fn-71-P7168_1870702:245-nf] ] that we should display such an extreme of presumption as to lay open God, and things which are not yet discovered,[fn-71-P7169_1870992:246-nf] as if already we had found out, by the vain talk about emissions, God Himself, the Creator of all things, and to assert that He derived His substance from apostasy and ignorance, so as to frame an impious hypothesis in opposition to God.","title":"Book II","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_58_book_iv_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"158","folder":"ANF-04","text":"It appears to me that Celsus has also misunderstood this statement, \"Let Us make man in Our image and likeness; \"[fn-91-P9193_2369771:125-nf] and has therefore represented the \"worms\" as saying that, being created by God, we altogether resemble Him.

Moreover, we who, according to Celsus, are \"worms,\" are represented by him as saying that, \"seeing some among us are guilty of sin, God will come to us, or will send His own Son, that He may consume the wicked, and that we other frogs may enjoy eternal life with Him.\" Observe how this venerable philosopher, like a low buffoon,[fn-91-P9199_2371790:131-nf] turns into ridicule and mockery, and a subject of laughter, the announcement of a divine judgment, and of the punishment of the wicked, and of the reward of the righteous; and subjoins to all this the remark, that \"such statements would be more endurable if made by worms and flogs than by Christians and Jews who quarrel with one another!\" We shall not, however, imitate his example, nor say similar things regarding those philosophers who profess to know the nature of all things, and who discuss with each other the manner in which all things were created, and how the heaven and earth originated, and all things in them; and how the souls (of men), being either unbegotten, and not created by God, are yet governed by Him, and pass from one body to another;[fn-92-P9200_2372571:132-nf] or being formed at the same time with the body, exist for ever or pass away. For instead of treating with respect and accepting the intention of those who have devoted themselves to the investigation of the truth, one might mockingly and revilingly say that such men were \"worms,\" who did not measure themselves by their comer of their dung-heap in human life, and who accordingly gave forth their opinions on matters of such importance as if they understood them, and who strenuously assert that they have obtained a view of those things which cannot be seen without a higher inspiration and a diviner power. \"For no man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him: even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.\"[fn-92-P9201_2373360:133-nf] We are not, however, mad, nor do we compare such human wisdom (I use the word \"wisdom\" in the common acceptation), which busies itself not about the affairs of the multitude, but in the investigation of truth, to the wrigglings of worms or any other such creatures; but in the spirit of truth, we testify of certain Greek philosophers that they knew God, seeing \"He manifested Himself to them,\"[fn-92-P9202_2373781:134-nf] although \"they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations; and professing themselves to be wise, they became foolish, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.\"[fn-92-P9203_2374117:135-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"ANF-02","text":"It is clear, then, that the truth has been hidden from us; and if that has been already shown by one example, we shall establish it a little after by several more.

Does not even he seem to thee to censure those who believe not? \"Now my just one shall live by faith,\"[fn-56-P5648_1707379:18-nf] the prophet said. And another prophet also says, \"Except ye believe, neither shall ye understand.\"[fn-56-P5649_1707495:19-nf] For how ever could the soul admit the transcendental contemplation of such themes, while unbelief respecting what was to be learned struggled within? But faith, which the Greeks disparage, deeming it futile and barbarous, is a voluntary preconception[fn-56-P5650_1707764:20-nf] the assent of piety-\"the subject of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,\" according to the divine apostle. \"For hereby,\" pre-eminently, \"the elders obtained a good report. But without faith it is impossible to please God.\"[fn-56-P5651_1708034:21-nf] Others have defined faith to be a uniting assent to an unseen object, as certainly the proof of an unknown thing is an evident assent. If then it be choice, being desirous of something, the desire is in this instance intellectual. And since choice is the beginning of action, faith is discovered to be the beginning of action, being the foundation of rational choice in the case of any one who exhibits to himself the previous demonstration through faith. Voluntarily to follow what is useful, is the first principle of understanding. Unswerving choice, then, gives considerable momentum in the direction of knowledge. The exercise of faith directly becomes knowledge, reposing on a sure foundation. Knowledge, accordingly, is defined by the sons of the philosophers as a habit, which cannot be overthrown by reason. Is there any other true condition such as this, except piety, of which alone the Word is teacher?[fn-56-P5652_1708972:22-nf] I think not. Theophrastus says that sensation is the root of faith. For from it the rudimentary principles extend to the reason that is in us, and the understanding. He who believeth then the divine Scriptures with sure judgment, receives in the voice of God, who bestowed the Scripture, a demonstration that cannot be impugned.

Now we make these remarks, not to disparage Plato (for the great world of men has found even him useful), but to point out the aim of those who said: \"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that our faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\"[fn-101-P10197_2702136:9-nf] For the word of God declares that the preaching (although in itself true and most worthy of belief) is not sufficient to reach the human heart, unless a certain power be imparted to the speaker from God, and a grace appear upon his words; and it is only by the divine agency that this takes place in those who speak effectually. The prophet says in the Psalms 67, that \"the Lord will give a word with great power to them who preach.\"[fn-101-P10198_2702592:10-nf] If, then, it should be granted with respect to certain points, that the same doctrines are found among the Greeks as in our own Scriptures, yet they do not possess the same power of attracting and disposing the souls of men to follow them. And therefore the disciples of Jesus, men ignorant so far as regards Grecian philosophy, yet traversed many countries of the world, impressing, agreeably to the desire of the Logos, each one of their hearers according to his deserts, so that they received a moral amelioration in proportion to the inclination of their will to accept of that which is good.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_61_book_vi_","source_chapter":72,"source_paragraph":"234","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Celsus accordingly, as not understanding the doctrine relating to the Spirit of God (\"for the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\"[fn-107-P10777_2874607:372-nf] ), weaves together (such a web) as pleases himself,[fn-107-P10778_2874685:373-nf] imagining that we, in calling God a Spirit, differ in no respect in this particular from the Stoics among the Greeks, who maintain that \"God is a Spirit, diffused through all things, and containing all things within Himself.\" Now the superintendence and providence of God does extend through all things, but not in the way that spirit does, according to the Stoics.

But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.\" And again: \"For whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal?\"[fn-40-P4066_1497599:20-nf] Concerning the natural he also speaks as follows: \"But the natural man perceiveth not the things that are of the spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him.\" But concerning the spiritual: \"But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged by no man.\"[fn-40-P4067_1497891:21-nf] And again \"You who are spiritual instruct such ones in the spirit of meekness.\"[fn-40-P4068_1497995:22-nf] And so, though at our renunciation we ceased to be carnal, i.e., we began to separate ourselves from intercourse with those in the world, and to have nothing to do with open pollution of the flesh, we must still be careful to strive with all our might to attain forthwith a spiritual condition, lest haply we flatter ourselves because we seem as far as the outer man is concerned to have renounced this world and got rid of the defilement of carnal fornication, as if by this we had reached the heights of perfection; and thence become careless and indifferent about purifying ourselves from other affections, and so being kept back between these two, become unable to reach the stage of spiritual advancement; either because we think that it is amply sufficient for our perfection if we seem to separate ourselves, as regards the outward man, from intercourse with this world and from its pleasure, or because we are free from corruption and carnal intercourse, and thus we find ourselves in that lukewarm condition which is considered the worst of all, and discover that we are spued out of the mouth of the Lord, in accordance with these words of His: \"I would that thou wert hot or cold. But now thou art lukewarm and I will begin to spue thee out of My mouth.\"[fn-40-P4069_1499278:23-nf] And not without good reason does the Lord declare that those whom he has previously received in the bowels of His love, and who have become shamefully lukewarm, shall be spued out and rejected from His bosom: in as much as, though they might have yielded Him some health-giving subsistence, they preferred to be torn away from His heart: thus becoming far worse than those who had never found their way into the Lord's mouth as food, just as we turn away with loathing from that which nausea compels us to bring up. For whatever is cold is warmed when received intothe mouth and is received with satisfaction and good results. But whatever has been once rejected owing to its miserable luke-warmness, we cannot - I will not say touch with the lips - but even look on from a distance without the greatest disgust. Rightly then is he said to be worse, because the carnal man, i.e., the worldly man and the heathen, is more readily brought to saving conversion and to the heights of perfection than one who has been professed as a monk, but has not, as his rule directs, laid hold on the way of perfection, and so has once for all drawn back from that fire of spiritual fervour. For the former is at last broken down by the sins of the flesh, and acknowledges his uncleanness, and in his compunction hastens from carnal pollution to the fountain of true cleansing, and the heights of perfection, and in his horror at that cold state of infidelity in which he finds himself, he is kindled with the fire of the spirit and flies the more readily to perfection. For one who has, as we said, once started with a lukewarm beginning, and has begun to abuse the name of monk, and who has not laid hold on the way of this profession with the humility and fervour that he ought, when once he is infected by this miserable plague, and is as it were unstrung by it, can no longer of himself discern what is perfect nor learn from the admonitions of another. For he says in his heart that which the Lord tells us: \"Because I am rich and wealthy and want nothing;\" and so this which follows is at once applied to him: \"But thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:\"[fn-40-P4070_1501474:24-nf] and he is so far in a worse condition than a worldly man, because he has no idea that he is wretched or blind or naked or requires cleansing, or needs to be directed and taught by any one; and on this account he receives no sound advice as he does not realise that he is weighted with the name of monk, and is lowered in the judgment of all, whereas, though everybody believes him to be a saint and regards him as a servant of God, he must hereafter be subjected to a stricter judgment and punishment. Lastly, why should we any longer linger over those things which we have sufficiently discovered and proved by experience? We have often seen those who were cold and carnal, i.e., worldly men and heathen, attain spiritual warmth: but lukewarm and \"natural\" men never. And these too we read in the prophet are hated of the Lord, so that a charge is given to spiritual and learned men to desist from warning and teaching them, and not to sow the seed of the life-giving word in ground that is barren and unfruitful and choked by noxious thorns; but that they should scorn this, and rather cultivate fallow ground, i.e., that they should transfer all their care and teaching, and their zeal in the life-giving word to pagans and worldly men: as we thus read: \"Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.\"[fn-40-P4071_1502878:25-nf] ","title":"IV.

Now God shall be glorified in His handiwork, fitting it so as to be conformable to, and modelled after, His own Son. For by the hands of the Father, that is, by the Son and the Holy Spirit, man, and not [merely] a part of man, was made in the likeness of God. Now the soul and the spirit are certainly a part of the man, but certainly not the man; for the perfect man consists in the commingling and the union of the soul receiving the spirit of the Father, and the admixture of that fleshly nature which was moulded after the image of God. For this reason does the apostle declare, \"We speak wisdom among them that are perfect,\"[fn-89-P8958_2575546:28-nf] terming those persons \"perfect\" who have received the Spirit of God, and who through the Spirit of God do speak in all languages, as he used Himself also to speak. In like manner we do also hear[fn-89-P8959_2575760:29-nf] many brethren in the Church, who possess prophetic gifts, and who through the Spirit speak all kinds of languages, and bring to light for the general benefit the hidden things of men, and declare the mysteries of God, whom also the apostle terms \"spiritual,\" they being spiritual because they partake of the Spirit, and not because their flesh has been stripped off and taken away, and because they have become purely spiritual. For if any one take away the substance of flesh, that is, of the handiwork [of God], and understand that which is purely spiritual, such then would not be a spiritual man but would be the spirit of a man, or the Spirit of God. But when the spirit here blended with the soul is united to [God's] handiwork, the man is rendered spiritual and perfect because of the outpouring of the Spirit, and this is he who was made in the image and likeness of God. But if the Spirit be wanting to the soul, he who is such is indeed of an animal nature, and being left carnal, shall be an imperfect being, possessing indeed the image [of God] in his formation (in plasmate), but not receiving the similitude through the Spirit; and thus is this being imperfect. Thus also, if any one take away the image and set aside the handiwork, he cannot then understand this as being a man, but as either some part of a man, as I have already said, or as something else than a man. For that flesh which has been moulded is not a perfect man in itself, but the body of a man, and part of a man. Neither is the soul itself, considered apart by itself, the man; but it is the soul of a man, and part of a man. Neither is the spirit a man, for it is called the spirit, and not a man; but the commingling and union of all these constitutes the perfect man. And for this cause does the apostle, explaining himself, make it clear that the saved man is a complete man as well as a spiritual man; saying thus in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, \"Now the God of peace sanctify you perfect (perfectos); and may your spirit, and soul, and body be preserved whole without complaint to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-89-P8960_2577929:30-nf] Now what was his object in praying that these three-that is, soul, body, and spirit-might be preserved to the coming of the Lord, unless he was aware of the [future] reintegration and union of the three, and [that they should be heirs of] one and the same salvation? For this cause also he declares that those are \"the perfect\" who present unto the Lord the three [component parts] without offence. Those, then, are the perfect who have had the Spirit of God remaining in them, and have preserved their souls and bodies blameless, holding fast the faith of God, that is, that faith which is [directed] towards God, and maintaining righteous dealings with respect to their neighbours.","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4.

Who then are the clean? Those who make their way by faith steadily towards the Father and the Son; for this is denoted by the steadiness of those which divide the hoof; and they meditate day and night upon the words of God,[fn-89-P8996_2588991:55-nf] that they may be adorned with good works: for this is the meaning of the ruminants.

Yet you, rulers of this present age, because you desire to be Christians, do not allow men to be Christians, seeing that, when they are believing in all honesty of heart, you draw them by the defilement and mist of your falsehood wholly over to your wickedness, that with their arms, which were provided against the enemies of the state, they should assail the Christians, and should think that, at your instigation, they are doing the work of Christ if they kill us whom you hate, according to the saying of the Lord Christ: `The time cometh,' He says, `that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.'[fn-53-P5362_2580484:262-nf] It makes no matter therefore to you, false teachers, whether the kings of this world desire to be heathens, which God forbid, or Christians, so long as you cease not in your efforts to arm them against the family of Christ. But do you not know, or rather, have you not read, that the guilt of one who instigates a murder is greater than the guilt of him who carries it out? Jezebel had excited the king her husband to the murder of a poor and righteous man, yet husband and wife alike perished by an equal punishment.[fn-53-P5363_2581023:263-nf] Nor indeed is your mode of urging on kings different from that by which the subtle persuasion of women has often urged kings on to guilt. For the wife of Herod earned and obtained the boon by means of her daughter, that the head of John should be brought to table in a charger.[fn-53-P5364_2581321:264-nf] Similarly the Jews forced on Pontius Pilate that he should crucify the Lord Jesus, whose blood Pilate prayed might remain in vengeance upon them and on their children.[fn-53-P5365_2581513:265-nf] So therefore you also overwhelm yourselves with our blood by your sin. For it does not follow that because it is the hand of the judge that strikes the blow, your calumnies therefore are not rather guilty of the deed. For the prophet David says, speaking in the person of Christ, `Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts, of the earth for Thy possession. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.' And he warned the kings themselves in the following precepts, that they should not, like ignorant men devoid of understanding, seek to persecute the Christians, lest they should themselves be destroyed,-which precepts I would that we could teach them, seeing that they are ignorant of them; or, at least, that you would show them to them, as doubtless you would do if you desired that they should live; or, at any rate; if neither of the other courses be allowed, that your malice would have permitted them to read them for themselves. The first Psalm of David would certainly have persuaded them that they should live and reign as Christians; but meanwhile you deceive them, so long as they entrust themselves to you. For you represent to them things that are evil, and you hide from them what is good. Let them then at length read this, which they should have read already long ago. For what does he say, `Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Lay hold of instruction lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the right way. Since how quickly has His wrath kindled over you? Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.'[fn-53-P5366_2583840:266-nf] You urge on emperors, I say, with your persuasions, even as Pilate, whom, as we showed above, the Jews urged on, though he himself cried aloud, as he washed his hands before them all, `I am innocent of the blood of this just person,'[fn-53-P5367_2584102:267-nf] -as though a person could be clear from the guilt of a sin who had himself committed it. But, to say nothing of ancient examples, observe, from instances taken from your own party, how very many of your emperors and judges have perished in persecuting us. To pass over Nero, who was the first to persecute the Christians, Domitian perished almost in the same way as Nero, as also did Trajan, Geta,[fn-53-P5368_2584524:268-nf] Decius, Valerian, Diocletian; Maximian also perished, at whose command that men should burn incense to their gods, burning the sacred volumes, Marcellinus indeed first, but after him also Mensurius of Carthage, and Caecilianus, escaped death from the sacrilegious flames, surviving like some ashes or cinders from the burning. For the consciousness of the guilt of burning incense involved you all, as many as agreed with Mensurius. Macarius perished, Ursacius[fn-53-P5369_2585376:269-nf] perished, and all your counts perished in like manner by the vengeance of God. For Ursacius was slain in a battle with the barbarians, after which birds of prey with their savage talons, and the greedy teeth of dogs with their biting, tore him limb from limb. Was not he too a murderer at your suggestion, who, like king Ahab, whom we showed to have been persuaded by a woman, slew a poor and righteous man?[fn-53-P5370_2586591:270-nf] So you too do not cease to murder us, who are just and poor (poor, that is, in worldly wealth; for in the grace of God no one of us is poor). For even if you do not murder a man with your hands, you do not cease to do so with your butcherous tongues. For it is written, `Death and life are in the power of the tongue.'[fn-53-P5371_2586931:271-nf] All, therefore, who have been murdered, you the instigator of the deed, have slain.

Thence emanated the doctrine of providence, and the revelation of high things; and prophecy having already been imparted to the philosophers of the Greeks, the treatment of dogma arose among the philosophers, sometimes true when they hit the mark, and sometimes erroneous, when they comprehended not the secret of the prophetic allegory. And this it is proposed briefly to indicate in running over the points requiring mention. Faith, then, we say, we are to show must not be inert and alone, but accompanied with investigation.

On the third day He rose again, He showed Himself to His disciples, ascended into heaven, and sent the Holy Ghost on the fiftieth day after the resurrection, the tenth after the ascension. The Holy Ghost who was sent filled all who were in one room, one hundred and twenty men.[fn-46-P4643_1985160:14-nf] They \"were filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with the tongues of all nations;\"[fn-46-P4644_1985269:15-nf] now was the calling manifest, now He went out to hire. For now the power of truth began to be made known to all. For then even one man having received the Holy Ghost, spake by himself with the tongues of all nations. But now in the Church oneness itself, as one man speaks in the tongues of all nations. For what tongue has not the Christian religion reached? to what limits does it not extend? Now is there no one \"who hideth himself from the heat thereof;\"[fn-46-P4645_1985745:16-nf] and delay is still ventured by him who stands still at the eleventh hour.","title":"Sermon XXXVII.

When the Jews were asked (as we have just now heard out of the Gospel when it was being read), how our Lord Jesus Christ, whom David himself called his Lord was David's Son, they were not able to answer. For what they saw in the Lord, that they knew. For He appeared to them as the Son of man; but as the Son of God He was hidden. Hence it was, that they believed that He could be overcome, and that they derided Him as He hung upon the Tree, saying, \"If He be the Son of God, let Him come down from the Cross, and we will believe on Him.\"[fn-48-P4897_2099310:1-nf] They saw one part of what He was, they knew not the other, \"For had they known Him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-48-P4898_2099464:2-nf] Yet they knew that the Christ was to be the Son of David. For even now they hope that He will come. They know not that He is come already, but this their ignorance is voluntary.

For in whose Name are all nations called and blessed, but in His whom they think not to have been the Christ?

All things that were spoken to the ancient people Israel in the manifold Scripture of the holy law, what things they did, whether in sacrifices, or in priestly offices, or in feast-days, and, in a word, in what things soever they worshipped God, what things soever were spoken to and given them in precept, were shadows of things to come. Of what things to come? Things which find their fulfillment in Christ. Whence the apostle says, \"For all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-13-P1366_864491:17-nf] that is, they are fulfilled in Him. Again he says in another place, \"All happened to them in a figure; but they were written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages is come.\"[fn-13-P1367_864690:18-nf] And he said elsewhere, \"For Christ is the end of the law;\"[fn-13-P1368_864767:19-nf] likewise in another place, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of a new moon, or of Sabbath-days, which is a shadow of things to come.\"[fn-13-P1369_864960:20-nf] If, therefore, all these things were shadows of things to come, also the feast of tabernacles was a shadow of things to come. Let us examine, then, of what thing to come was this feast-day a shadow. I have explained what this feast of tabernacles was: it was a celebration of tabernacles, because the people, after their deliverance from Egypt, while directing their course through the wilderness to the land of promise, dwelt in tents. Let us observe what it is, and we shall be that thing; we, I say, who are members of Christ, if such we are; but we are, He having made us worthy, not we having earned it for ourselves. Let us then consider ourselves, brethren: we have been led out of Egypt, where we were slaves to the devil as to Pharaoh; where we applied ourselves to works of clay, engaged in earthly desires, and where we toiled exceedingly. And to us, while laboring, as it were, at the bricks, Christ cried aloud, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.\" Thence we were led out by baptism as through the Red Sea.-red because consecrated by the blood of Christ. All our enemies that pursued us being dead, that is, all our sins being blotted out, we have been brought over to the other side. At the present time, then, before we come to the land of promise, namely, the eternal kingdom, we are in the wilderness in tabernacles. They who acknowledge these things are in tabernacles; for it was to be that some would acknowledge this. For that man, who understands that he is a sojourner in this world, is in tabernacles. That man understands that he is travelling in a foreign country, when he sees himself sighing for his native land. But whilst the body of Christ is in tabernacles, Christ is in tabernacles; but at that time He was so, not evidently but secretly. For as yet the shadow obscured the light; when the light came, the shadow was removed. Christ was in secret: He was in the feast of tabernacles, but there hidden. At the present time, when these things are already made manifest, we acknowledge that we are journeying in the wilderness: for if we know it, we are in the wilderness. What is it to be in the wilderness? In the desert waste. Why in the desert waste? Because in this world, where we thirst in a way in which is no water. But yet, let us thirst that we may be filled. For, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-13-P1370_867398:21-nf] And our thirst is quenched from the rock in the wilderness: for \"the Rock was Christ,\" and it was smitten with a rod that the water might flow. But that it might flow, the rock was smitten twice: because there are two beams of the cross.[fn-13-P1371_867653:22-nf] All these things, then, which were done in a figure, are made manifest to us. And it is not without meaning that it was said of the Lord, \"He went up to the feast-day. but not openly, but as it were in secret.\" For Himself in secret was the thing prefigured, because Christ was hid in that same festal-day; for that very festal-day signified Christ's members that were to sojourn in a foreign land.","title":"Tractate XXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"53.

But now let us see what Asterius the Sophist says, the retained pleader[fn-65-P6510_2585158:14-nf] for the heresy. In imitation then of the Jews so far, he writes as follows; `It is very plain that He has said, that He is in the Father and the Father again in Him, for this reason, that neither the word on which He was discoursing is, as He says, His own, but the Father's, nor the works belong to Him, but to the Father who gave Him the power.' Now this, if uttered at random by a little child, had been excused from his age; but when one who bears the title of Sophist, and professes universal knowledge[fn-65-P6511_2585693:15-nf] , is the writer, what a serious condemnation does he deserve! And does he not shew himself a stranger to the Apostle[fn-65-P6512_2586096:16-nf] , as being puffed up with persuasive words of wisdom, and thinking thereby to succeed in deceiving, not understanding himself what he says nor whereof he affirms[fn-65-P6513_2586277:17-nf] ?

And how can we read of so close a union of man and God, as to make it appear that man was ever co-eternal with God, and that afterwards God suffered with man: whereas we cannot believe that man can be without beginning or that God can suffer? It is this which we established in our previous writings; viz., that God being joined to manhood,[fn-74-P7412_2719346:37-nf] i.e., to His own body, does not allow any separation to be made in men's thoughts between man and God. Nor will He permit anyone to hold that there is one Person of the Son of man, and another Person of the Son of God. But in all the holy Scriptures He joins together and as it were incorporates in the Godhead, the Lord's manhood,[fn-74-P7413_2719699:38-nf] so that no one can sever man from God in time, nor God from man at His Passion. For if you regard Him in time, you will find that the Son of man is ever with the Son of God. If you take note of His Passion, you will find that the Son of God is ever with the Son of man, and that Christ theSon of man and the Son of God is so one and indivisible, that, in the language of holy Scripture, the man cannot be severed in time from God, nor God from man at His Passion. Hence comes this: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-74-P7414_2720311:39-nf] Where the Son of God while He was speaking on earth testified that the Son of man was in heaven: and testified that the same Son of man, who, He said, would ascend into heaven, had previously come down from heaven. And this: \"What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before,\"[fn-74-P7415_2720630:40-nf] where He gives the name of Him who was born of man, but affirms that He ever was up on high. And the Apostle also, when considering what happened in time, says that all things were made by Christ. For he says, \"There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.\"[fn-74-P7416_2720919:41-nf] But when speaking of His Passion, he shows that the Lord of glory was crucified. \"For if,\" he says, \"they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-74-P7417_2721133:42-nf] And so too the Creed speaking of the only and first-begotten Lord Jesus Christ, \"Very God of Very God, Being of one substance with the Father, and the Maker of all things,\" affirms that He was born of the Virgin and crucified and afterwards buried. Thus joining in one body (as it were) the Son of God and of man, and uniting God and man, so that there can be no severance either in time or at the Passion, since the Lord Jesus Christ is shown to be one and the same Person, both as God through all eternity, and as man through the endurance of His Passion; and though we cannot say that man is without beginning orthat God is passible, yet in the one Person of the Lord Jesus Christ we can speak of man as eternal, and of God as dead. You see then that Christ means the whole Person, and that the name represents both natures, for both man and God are born, and so it takes in the whole Person so that when this name is used we see that no part is left out. There was not then before the birth of a Virgin the same eternity belonging in the past to the manhood as to the Divinity, but because Divinity was united to manhood in the womb of the Virgin, it follows that when we use the name of Christ one cannot be spoken of without the other.","title":"Book VI.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_85_book_vii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"For as,\" you say, \"by man came death, so by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\" Do\nyou actually try to prove your wrong and impious notion by the witness of the Apostle?

And yet, if you wanted to make use of Apostolic witnesses, why did you rest contented with one,\nand pass over all the others in silence? and why did you not at once add this: \"Paul, an Apostle not\nof men neither by man, but by Jesus Christ:\"[fn-74-P7475_2751359:16-nf] or this: \"We speak wisdom among the perfect:\" and\npresently: \"Whom none,\" says he, \"of the princes of this world knew; for had they known, they would\nnot have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-74-P7476_2751569:17-nf] Or\nthis: \"For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.\"[fn-74-P7477_2751656:18-nf] And: \"One Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all\nthings.\"[fn-74-P7478_2751735:19-nf] Or do you partly agree, and\npartly disagree with the Apostle, and only receive him so far as in consequence of the\nIncarnation[fn-74-P7479_2751880:20-nf] he names Christ man, and\nrepudiate him where he speaks of Him as God? For Paul does not deny that Jesus is man, but still he\nconfesses that man is God: and declares that to mankind the resurrection came by man in such a way\nthat he shows that in that man God arose. For see whether he declares that He who rose was God, as he\nbears his witness that He who was crucified was the Lord of glory.","title":"Book VII.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_45_tractate_xl_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9.

For when he says, \"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;\" do not suppose that so much hath been attributed to the spirit of man. It is the Spirit of God who fighteth in thee against thyself, against that which in thee is against thee. For thou wouldest not stand to Godward; thou didst fall, wast broken; as a vessel when it falls from a man's hand to the ground, wast thou broken. And because thou wast broken, therefore art thou turned against thyself; therefore art thou contrary to thine own self. Let there be nought in thee contrary to thyself, and thou shalt stand in thine integrity. For that thou mayest know that this office appertaineth to the Holy Spirit; the Apostle saith in another place,\" For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\"[fn-61-P6158_2612665:23-nf] From these words man was at once uplifting himself, as though by his own spirit he were able to mortify the deeds of the flesh. \"If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if through the Spirit ye do mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\" Explain to us, Apostle, through what spirit? For man also hath a spirit appertaining to his proper nature, whereby he is man. For man consists of body and spirit. And of this spirit of man it is said, \"No man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.\"[fn-61-P6159_2613215:24-nf] I see then that man himself hath his own spirit appertaining to his proper nature, and I hear thee saying, \"But if through the Spirit ye do mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\" I ask, through what spirit; my own, or God's? For I hear thy words, and am still perplexed by this ambiguity. For when the word \"spirit\" is used, it is used sometimes of the spirit of a man, and of cattle, as it is written, that \"all flesh which had in itself the spirit of life, died by the flood.\"[fn-61-P6160_2613724:25-nf] And so the word spirit is spoken of cattle, and spoken of man too. Sometimes even the wind is called spirit; as it is in the Psalm, \"Fire, hail, snow, frost, the spirit of the tempest.\"[fn-61-P6161_2613940:26-nf] For as much then as the word \"spirit\" is used in many ways, by what spirit, O Apostle, hast thou said that the deeds of the flesh are to be mortified; by mine own, or by the Spirit of God? Hear what follows, and understand. The difficulty is removed by the following words. For when he had said, \"But if through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live;\"[fn-61-P6162_2614371:27-nf] he added immediately, \"For as many as are acted[fn-61-P6163_2614439:28-nf] upon by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\" Thou dost act, if thou art acted upon, and actest well, if thou art acted upon by the Good. So then when he said to thee,\" If through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live;\" and it was doubtful with thee of what spirit he had spoken, in the words following understand the Master, acknowledge the Redeemer. For That Redeemer hath given thee the Spirit Whereby thou mayest mortify the deeds of the flesh. \"For as many as are acted upon by the Spirit of Cool, they are the sons of God.\"They are not the sons of God if they are not acted upon by the Spirit of God. But if they are acted upon by the Spirit of God, they fight; because they have a mighty Helper.

The end of such abandonment as this can be nothing but error, as the Lord, when reproving them, saith, `Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures[fn-95-P9581_3451872:32-nf] .' Afterwards when, being reproved, they should have come to their senses, they rather grew insolent, saying, `We are Moses' disciples; and we know that God spake to Moses[fn-95-P9582_3452075:33-nf] ;' dealing the more falsely by that very expression, and accusing themselves. For had they believed him to whom they hearkened, they would not have denied the Lord, Who spake by Moses, when He was present. Not so did the eunuch in the Acts, for when he heard, `Understandest thou what thou readest[fn-95-P9583_3452394:34-nf] ?' he was not ashamed to confess his ignorance, and implored to be taught. Therefore, to him who became a learner, the grace of the Spirit was given. But as for those Jews who persisted in their ignorance; as the proverb saith, `Death came upon them. For the fool dies in his sins[fn-95-P9584_3452695:35-nf] .'","title":"Letter XIX.

For, as the blessed Apostle teaches, \"we have received not the spirit of this world but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which are given us by God[fn-31-P3102_744836:6-nf] :\" and that Spirit can in no other way be rightly worshipped, except by offering Him that which we received from Him. But in the treasures of the Lord's bounty what can we find so suitable to the honour of the present feast as the peace, which at the Lord's nativity was first proclaimed by the angel-choir? For that it is which brings forth the sons of God, the nurse of love and the mother of unity: the rest of the blessed and our eternal home; whose proper work and special office it is to join to God those whom it removes from the world. Whence the Apostle incites us to this good end, in saying, \"being justified therefore by faith let us have peace towards God[fn-31-P3103_745524:7-nf] .\" In which brief sentence are summed up nearly all the commandments; for where true peace is, there can be no lack of virtue. But what is it, dearly beloved, to have peace towards God, except to wish what He bids, and not to wish what He forbids? For if human friendships seek out equality of soul and similarity of desires, and difference of habits can never attain to full harmony, how will he be partaker of divine peace, who is pleased with what displeases God and desires to get delight from what he knows to be offensive to God? That is not the spirit of the sons of God; such wisdom is not acceptable to the noble family of the adopted. That chosen and royal race must live up to the dignity of its regeneration, must love what the Father loves, and in nought disagree with its Maker, lest the Lord should again say: \"I have begotten and raised up sons, but they have scorned Me: the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known Me and My people hath not acknowledged Me[fn-31-P3104_746550:8-nf] .\"","title":"Sermon XXVI.

We are therefore to understand that he who loves has already the Holy Spirit, and by what he has becomes worthy of a fuller possession, that by having the more he may love the more. Already, therefore, had the disciples that Holy Spirit whom the Lord promised, for without Him they could not call Him Lord; but they had Him not as yet in the way promised by the Lord. Accordingly they both had, and had Him not, inasmuch as they had Him not as yet to the same extent as He was afterwards to be possessed. They had Him, therefore, in a more limited sense: He was yet to be given them in an ampler measure. They had Him in a hidden way, they were yet to receive Him in a way that was manifest; for this present possession had also a bearing on that fuller gift of the Holy Spirit, that they might come to a conscious knowledge of what they had. It is in speaking of this gift that the apostle says: \"Now we have received, not the spirit of this world, but the spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-27-P2756_1608492:6-nf] For that same manifest bestowal of the Holy Spirit the Lord made, not once, but on two separate occasions. For close on the back of His resurrection from the dead He breathed on them and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-27-P2757_1608733:7-nf] And because He then gave [the Spirit], did He on that account fail in afterwards sending Him according to His promise? Or was it not the very same Spirit who was both then breathed upon them by Himself, and afterwards sent by Him from heaven?[fn-27-P2758_1608993:8-nf] And so, why that same giving on His part which took place publicly, also took place twice, is another question: for it may be that this twofold bestowal of His in a public way took place because of the two Commandments of love, that is, to our neighbor and to God, in order that love might be impressively intimated as pertaining to the Holy Spirit, And if any other reason is to be sought for, we cannot at present allow our discourse to be improperly prolonged by such an inquiry: provided, however, it be admitted that, without the Holy Spirit, we can neither love Christ nor keep His commandments; while the less experience we have of His presence, the less also can we do so; and the fuller our experience, so much the greater our ability. Accordingly, the promise is no vain one, either to him who has not [the Holy Spirit], or to him who has. For it is made to him who has not, in order that he may have; and to him who has, that he may have moreabundantly.

Let us, brethren, let us understand, and may the Lord enable us to understand, and enable us also to do what we understand. And if we know this, we know of a truth what the Lord doeth; for it is only the Lord that so enables us, and by such means only do we attain to His friendship. For just as there are two kinds of fear, which produce two classes of fearers; so there are two kinds of service, which produce two classes of servants. There is a fear, which perfect love casteth out;[fn-29-P2959_1690430:3-nf] and there is another fear, which is clean, and endureth for ever.[fn-29-P2960_1690514:4-nf] The fear that lies not in love, the apostle pointed to when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\"[fn-29-P2961_1690662:5-nf] But he referred to the clean fear when he said, \"Be not high-minded, but fear.\"[fn-29-P2962_1690760:6-nf] In that fear which love casteth out, there has also to be cast out the service along with it: for both were joined together by the apostle, that is, the service and the fear, when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\" And it was the servant connected with this kind of service that the Lord also had in His eye when He said, \"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.\" Certainly not the servant characterized by the clean fear, to whom it is said, \"Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy lord;\" but the servant who is characterized by the fear which love casteth out, of whom He elsewhere saith, \"The servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever.\"[fn-29-P2963_1691547:7-nf] Since, therefore, He hath given us power to become the sons of God,[fn-29-P2964_1691634:8-nf] let us not be servants, but sons: that, in some wonderful and indescribable but real way, we may as servants have the power not to be servants; servants, indeed, with that clean fear which distinguishes the servant that enters into the joy of his lord, but not servants with the fear that i has to be cast out, and which marketh him that abideth not in the house for ever. But let us bear in mind that it is the Lord that enableth us to serve so as not to be servants. And this it is that is unknown to the servant, who knoweth not what his Lord doeth; and who, when he doeth any good thing, is lifted up as if he did it himself, and not his Lord; and so, glories not in the Lord, but in himself, thereby deceiving himself, because glorying, as if he had not received.[fn-29-P2965_1692419:9-nf] But let us, beloved, in order that we may be the friends of the Lord, know what our Lord doeth. For it is He who makes us not only men, but also righteous, and not we ourselves. And who but He is the doer, in leading us to such a knowledge? For \"we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-29-P2966_1692829:10-nf] Whatever good there is, is freely given by Him.

Much time had I spent in vanity, and had wasted nearly all my youth in the vain labour which I underwent in acquiring the wisdom made foolish by God. Then once upon a time, like a man roused from deep sleep, I turned my eyes to the marvellous light of the truth of the Gospel, and I perceived the uselessness of \"the wisdom of the princes of this world, that come to naught.\" I wept many tears over my miserable life and I prayed that guidance might be vouchsafed me to admit me to the doctrines of true religion. First of all was I minded to make some mending of my ways, long perverted as they were by my intimacy with wicked men. Then I read the Gospel, and I saw there that a great means of reaching perfection was the selling of one's goods, the sharing them with the poor, the giving up of all care for this life, and the refusal to allow the soul to be turned by any sympathy to things of earth. And I prayed that I might find some one of the brethren who had chosen this way of life, that with him I might cross life's short[fn-53-P5311_1662298:11-nf] and troubled strait. And many did I find in Alexandria, and many in the rest of Egypt, and others in Palestine, and in Coele Syria, and in Mesopotamia. I admired their continence in living, and their endurance in toil; I was amazed at their persistency in prayer, and at their triumphing over sleep; subdued by no natural necessity, ever keeping their souls' purpose high and free, in hunger, in thirst, in cold, in nakedness,[fn-53-P5312_1662744:12-nf] they never yielded to the body; they were never willing to waste attention on it; always, as though living in a flesh that was not theirs, they shewed in very deed what it is to sojourn for a while in this life,[fn-53-P5313_1662971:13-nf] and what to have one's citizenship and home in heaven.[fn-53-P5314_1663046:14-nf] All this moved my admiration. I called these men's lives blessed, in that they did in deed shew that they \"bear about in their body the dying of Jesus.\"[fn-53-P5315_1663221:15-nf] And I prayed that I, too, as far as in me lay, might imitate them.","title":"Letter CCXXIII.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_33_letter_xxviii_to_flavian_commonly_called_the_tome_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Therefore in consequence of this unity of person which is to be understood in both natures[fn-11-P1124_265476:45-nf] , we read of the Son of Man also descending from heaven, when the Son of God took flesh from the Virgin who bore Him. And again the Son of God is said to have been crucified and buried, although it was not actually in His Divinity whereby the Only-begotten is co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father, but in His weak human nature that He suffered these things. And so it is that in the Creed also we all confess that the Only-begotten Son of God was crucified and buried, according to that saying of the Apostle: \"for if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory[fn-11-P1125_266352:46-nf] .\" But when our Lord and Saviour Himself would instruct His disciples' faith by His questionings, He said, \"Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?\" And when they had put on record the various opinions of other people, He said, \"But ye, whom do ye say that I am?\" Me, that is, who am the Son of Man, and whom ye see in the form of a slave, and in true flesh, whom do ye say that I am? Whereupon blessed Peter, whose divinely inspired confession was destined to profit all nations, said, \"Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God[fn-11-P1126_266906:47-nf] .\" And not undeservedly was he pronounced blessed by the Lord, drawing from the chief corner-stone[fn-11-P1127_267030:48-nf] the solidity of power which his name also expresses, he, who, through the revelation of the Father, confessed Him to be at once Christ and Son of God: because the receiving of the one of these without the other was of no avail to salvation, and it was equally perilous to have believed the Lord Jesus Christ to be either only God without man, or only man without God. But after the Lord's resurrection (which, of course, was of His true body, because He was raised the same as He had died and been buried), what else was effected by the forty days' delay than the cleansing of our faith's purity from all darkness? For to that end He talked with His disciples, and dwelt and ate with them, He allowed Himself to be handled with diligent and curious touch by those who were affected by doubt, He entered when the doors were shut upon the Apostles, and by His breathing upon them gave them the Holy Spirit[fn-11-P1128_268604:49-nf] , and bestowing on them the light of understanding, opened the secrets of the Holy Scriptures[fn-11-P1129_268719:50-nf] . So again He showed the wound in His side, the marks of the nails, and all the signs of His quite recent suffering, saying, \"See My hands and feet, that it is I. Handle Me and see that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have[fn-11-P1130_268981:51-nf] ;\" in order that the properties of His Divine and human nature might be acknowledged to remain still inseparable: and that we might know the Word not to be different from the flesh, in such a sense as also to confess that the one Son of God iS both the Word and flesh[fn-11-P1131_269263:52-nf] . Of this mystery of the faith[fn-11-P1132_269391:53-nf] your opponent Eutyches must be reckoned to have but little sense if he bus recognized our nature in the Only-begotten of God neither through the humiliation of His having to die, nor through the glory of His rising again. Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John's declaration when he says, \"every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh, is of God: and every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of God, and this is Antichrist[fn-11-P1133_269885:54-nf] .\" But what is \"to destroy Jesus,\" except to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the mystery, by which alone we were saved, by the most barefaced fictions. The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ's body, he must also be befooled by the same blindness in the matter of His sufferings. For if he does not think the cross of the Lord fictitious, and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is likewise true, let him acknowledge the flesh of Him whose death he already believes: and let him not disbelieve Him man with a body like ours, since he acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer: seeing that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His bodily suffering. If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ears from the preaching of the Gospel: let him see what was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and, when the side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier's spear, let him understand whence it was that blood and water flowed, that the Church of God might be watered from the font and from the cup[fn-11-P1134_271585:55-nf] . Let him hear also the blessed Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ's blood[fn-11-P1135_271924:56-nf] . And let him not read cursorily the same Apostle's words when he says, \"Knowing that not with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain manner of life which is part of your fathers' tradition, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and blemish[fn-11-P1136_272279:57-nf] .\" Let him not resist too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says: \"and the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us from all sin[fn-11-P1137_272439:58-nf] .\" And again: \"this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.\" And \"who is He that overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God.

If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit specially flora the following point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three creations. The first is the evolution from non-being into being.[fn-27-P2734_922103:72-nf] The second is change from the worse to the better. The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son. There is a bringing into existence of the heavens; and what says David? \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.\"[fn-27-P2735_922884:73-nf] Again, man is created through baptism, for \"if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.\"[fn-27-P2736_923038:74-nf] And why does the Saviour say to the disciples, \"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\"? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the Father and the Son. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.[fn-27-P2737_923451:75-nf] And He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.[fn-27-P2738_923553:76-nf] For what the holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? \"You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.\"[fn-27-P2739_923786:77-nf] Now every temple[fn-27-P2740_923823:78-nf] is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for \"He that built all things is God.\"[fn-27-P2741_924303:79-nf] If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shale worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.[fn-27-P2742_924490:80-nf] Supposing them to object to the word \"God,\" let them learn what this word means. God is called Qeo\\j either because He placed (teqeike/nai) all things or because He beholds (Qea=sqai) all things. If He is called Qeo\\j because He \"placed\" or \"beholds\" all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.[fn-27-P2743_924902:81-nf] Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God,[fn-27-P2744_925167:82-nf] then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For \"the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;\"[fn-27-P2745_925393:83-nf] and \"thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\"[fn-27-P2746_925532:84-nf] But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said \"if I by the finger of God cast out devils,\"[fn-27-P2747_925648:85-nf] of which the version in another Gospel is \"if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.\"[fn-27-P2748_925753:86-nf] So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_56_letter_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"4.

We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, \"But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.\"[fn-31-P3112_1012024:7-nf] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God;[fn-31-P3113_1012350:8-nf] for we are taught by Holy Scripture that \"All things were made by Him,\"[fn-31-P3114_1012794:9-nf] and \"by Him consist.\"[fn-31-P3115_1012831:10-nf] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.[fn-31-P3116_1013067:11-nf] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,[fn-31-P3117_1013181:12-nf] which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_56_letter_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"4.
