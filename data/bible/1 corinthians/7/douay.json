{"verses":["Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me:  It is good for\na man not to touch a woman.","But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife:  and\nlet every woman have her own husband.","Let the husband render the debt to his wife:  and the wife also in\nlike manner to the husband.","The wife hath not power of her own body:  but the husband.  And in\nlike manner the husband also hath not power of his own body:  but the\nwife.","Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time,\nthat you may give yourselves to prayer:  and return together again, lest\nSatan tempt you for your incontinency.","But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.","For I would that all men were even as myself.  But every one hath\nhis proper gift from God:  one after this manner, and another after\nthat.","But I say to the unmarried and to the widows:  It is good for them\nif they so continue, even as I.","But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry.  For it is\nbetter to marry than to be burnt.","But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth\nthat the wife depart not from her husband.","And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to\nher husband.  And let not the husband put away his wife.","For to the rest I speak, not the Lord.  If any brother hath a wife\nthat believeth not and she consent to dwell with him:  let him not put\nher away.","And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent\nto dwell with her:  let her not put away her husband.","For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife:\nand the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband.\nOtherwise your children should be unclean:  but now they are holy.","But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart.  For a brother or\nsister is not under servitude in such cases.  But God hath called us in\npeace.","For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy\nhusband?  Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?","But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called\nevery one:  so let him walk.  And so in all churches I teach.","Is any man called, being circumcised?  Let him not procure\nuncircumcision.  Is any man called in uncircumcision?  Let him not be\ncircumcised.","Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing:  but the\nobservance of the commandments of God.","Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.","Wast thou called, being a bondman?  Care not for it:  but if thou\nmayest be made free, use it rather.","For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the\nfreeman of the Lord.  Likewise he that is called, being free, is the\nbondman of Christ.","You are bought with a price:  be not made the bondslaves of men.","Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide\nwith God.","Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord:  but I\ngive counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.","I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity:\nthat it is good for a man so to be.","Art thou bound to a wife?  Seek not to be loosed.  Art thou loosed\nfrom a wife?  Seek not a wife.","But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned.  And if a virgin\nmarry, she hath not sinned:  nevertheless, such shall have tribulation\nof the flesh.  But I spare you.","This therefore I say, brethren:  The time is short.  It remaineth,\nthat they also who have wives be as if they had none:","And they that weep, as though they wept not:  and they that\nrejoice, as if they rejoiced not:  and they that buy as if they\npossessed not:","And they that use this world, as if they used it not.  For the\nfashion of this world passeth away.","But I would have you to be without solicitude.  He that is without\na wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord:  how he may\nplease God.","But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the\nworld:  how he may please his wife.  And he is divided.","And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of\nthe Lord:  that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.  But she that\nis married thinketh on the things of the world:  how she may please her\nhusband.","And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you,\nbut for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend\nupon the Lord, without impediment.","But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to\nhis virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be:  let him\ndo what he will.  He sinneth not if she marry.","For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having\nno necessity, but having power of his own will:  and hath judged this in\nhis heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.","Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well:\nand he that giveth her not doth better.","A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth:  but if\nher husband die, she is at liberty.  Let her marry to whom she will:\nonly in the Lord.","But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my\ncounsel.  And I think that I also have the spirit of God."]}
