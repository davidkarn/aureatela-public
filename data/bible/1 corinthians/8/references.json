Nay, on the contrary, we must not doubt that they are in affinity with manifold idolatry: first, in that it is necessary for them to preach the gods of the nations, to express their names, genealogies, honourable distinctions, all and singular; and further, to observe the solemnities and festivals of the same, as of them by whose means they compute their revenues. What schoolmaster, without a table of the seven idols,[fn-6-P698_294827:60-nf] will yet frequent the Quinquatria? The very first payment of every pupil he consecrates both to the honour and to the name of Minerva; so that, even though he be not said \"to eat of that which is sacrificed to idols\"[fn-6-P699_295074:61-nf] nominally (not being dedicated to any particular idol), he is shunned as an idolater. What less of defilement does he recur on that ground,[fn-7-P700_295240:62-nf] than a business brings which, both nominally and virtually, is consecrated publicly to an idol? The Minervalia are as much Minerva's, as the Saturnalia Saturn's; Saturn's, which must necessarily be celebrated even by little slaves at the time of the Saturnalia. New-year's gifts likewise must be caught at, and the Septimontium kept; and all the presents of Midwinter and the feast of Dear Kinsmanship must be exacted; the schools must be wreathed with flowers; the flamens' wives and the Âµdiles sacrifice; the school is honoured on the appointed holy-days. The same thing takes place on an idol's birthday; every pomp of the devil is frequented. Who will think that these things are befitting to a Christian master,[fn-7-P701_296010:63-nf] unless it be he who shall think them suitable likewise to one who is not a master? We know it may be said, \"If teaching literature is not lawful to God's servants, neither will learning be likewise; \"and, \"How could one be trained unto ordinary human intelligence, or unto any sense or action whatever, since literature is the means of training for all life? How do we repudiate secular studies, without which divine studies cannot be pursued? \"Let us see, then, the necessity of literary erudition; let us reflect that partly it cannot be admitted, partly cannot be avoided. Learning literature is allowable for believers, rather than teaching; for the principle of learning and of teaching is different. If a believer teach literature, while he is teaching doubtless he commends, while he delivers he affirms, while he recalls he bears testimony to, the praises of idols interspersed therein. He seals the gods themselves with this name;[fn-7-P702_297143:64-nf] whereas the Law, as we have said, prohibits \"the names of gods to be pronounced,\"[fn-7-P703_297254:65-nf] and this name[fn-7-P704_297344:66-nf] to be conferred on vanity.[fn-7-P705_297399:67-nf] Hence the devil gets men's early faith built up from the beginnings of their erudition. Inquire whether he who catechizes about idols commit idolatry. But when a believer learns these things, if he is already capable of understanding what idolatry is, he neither receives nor allows them; much more if he is not yet capable. Or, when he begins to understand, it behoves him first to understand what he has previously learned, that is, touching God and the faith. Therefore he will reject those things, and will not receive them; and will be as safe as one who from one who knows it not, knowingly accepts poison, but does not drink it. To him necessity is attributed as an excuse, because he has no other way to learn. Moreover, the not teaching literature is as much easier than the not learning, as it is easier, too, for the pupil not to attend, than for the master not to frequent, the rest of the defilements incident to the schools from public and scholastic solemnities.","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_08_the_epistle_of_mathetes_to_diognetus","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-01","text":"When you have read and carefully listened to these things, you shall know what God bestows on such as rightly love Him, being made [as ye are] a paradise of delight, presenting[fn-7-P735_138289:62-nf] in yourselves a tree bearing all kinds of produce and flourishing well, being adorned with various fruits.

What sense is there in discussing the merely accidental, when that on which it rests is to be condemned? Do we believe it lawful for a human oath[fn-10-P1091_449331:38-nf] to be superadded to one divine, for a man to come under promise to another master after Christ, and to abjure father, mother, and all nearest kinsfolk, whom even the law has commanded us to honour and love next to God Himself, to whom the gospel, too, holding them only of less account than Christ, has in like manner rendered honour? Shall it be held lawful to make an occupation of the sword, when the Lord proclaims that he who uses the sword shall perish by the sword? And shall the son of peace take part in the battle when it does not become him even to sue at law? And shall he apply the chain, and the prison, and the torture, and the punishment, who is not the avenger even of his own wrongs? Shall he, forsooth, either keep watch-service for others more than for Christ, or shall he do it on the Lord's day, when he does not even do it for Christ Himself? And shall he keep guard before the temples which he has renounced? And shall he take a meal where the apostle has forbidden him?[fn-10-P1092_450422:39-nf] And shall he diligently protect by night those whom in the day-time he has put to flight by his exorcisms, leaning and resting on the spear the while with which Christ's side was pierced? Shall he carry a flag,[fn-10-P1093_450655:40-nf] too, hostile to Christ? And shall he ask a watchword from the emperor who has already received one from God? Shall he be disturbed in death by the trumpet of the trumpeter, who expects to be aroused by the angel's trump? And shall the Christian be burned according to camp rule, when he was not permitted to burn incense to an idol, when to him Christ remitted the punishment of fire? Then how many other offences there are involved in the performances of camp offices, which we must hold to involve a transgression of God's law, you may see by a slight survey. The very carrying of the name over from the camp of light to the camp of darkness is a violation of it. Of course, if faith comes later, and finds any preoccupied with military service, their case is different, as in the instance of those whom John used to receive for baptism, and of those most faithful centurions, I mean the centurion whom Christ approves, and the centurion whom Peter instructs; yet, at the same time, when a man has become a believer, and faith has been sealed, there must be either an immediate abandonment of it, which has been the course with many; or all sorts of quibbling will have to be resorted to in order to avoid offending God, and that is not allowed even outside of military service;[fn-10-P1094_451999:41-nf] or, last of all, for God the fate must be endured which a citizen-faith has been no less ready to accept. Neither does military service hold out escape from punishment of sins, or exemption from martyrdom. Nowhere does the Christian change his character. There is one gospel, and the same Jesus, who will one day deny every one who denies, and acknowledge every one who acknowledges God,-who will save, too, the life which has been lost for His sake; but, on the other hand, destroy that which for gain has been saved to His dishonour. With Him the faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen.[fn-10-P1095_453300:42-nf] A state of faith admits no plea of necessity; they are under no necessity to sin, whose one necessity is, that they do not sin. For if one is pressed to the offering of sacrifice and the sheer denial of Christ by the necessity of torture or of punishment, yet discipline does not connive even at that necessity; because there is a higher necessity to dread denying and to undergo martyrdom, than to escape from suffering, and to render the homage required. In fact, an excuse of this sort overturns the entire essence of our sacrament, removing even the obstacle to voluntary sins; for it will be possible also to maintain that inclination is a necessity, as involving in it, forsooth, a sort of compulsion. I have, in fact, disposed of this very allegation of necessity with reference to the pleas by which crowns connected with official position are vindicated, in support of which it is in common use, since for this very reason offices must be either refused, that we may not fall into acts of sin, or martyrdoms endured that we may get quit of offices. Touching this primary aspect of the question, as to the unlawfulness even of a military life itself, I shall not add more, that the secondary question may be restored to its place. Indeed, if, putting my strength to the question, I banish from us the military life, I should now to no purpose issue a challenge on the matter of the military crown.

Sin, indeed, was not made by Him; and it is plain that sin is nothing, and men become nothing when they sin.

What more excellent than an angel among created things? what lower than a worm? He who made the angel made the worm also; but the angel is fit for heaven, the worm for earth.

That thou mightest suck, who wert not able to chew.

This is also set forth in the following passage of the Epistle to the Corinthians: \"As concerning, therefore, the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.

But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, shall we abound; neither, if we eat not, shall we suffer want. But take heed, lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that are weak. For if any man see one who has knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his conscience being weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?

Yet Scripture at the beginning of that narrative does not say, three men appeared to him, but, \"The Lord appeared to him.\" And then, setting forth in due order after what manner the Lord appeared to him, it has added the account of the three men, whom Abraham invites to his hospitality in the plural number, and afterwards speaks to them in the singular number as one; and as one He promises him a son by Sara, viz. the one whom the Scripture calls Lord, as in the beginning of the same narrative, \"The Lord,\" it says, \"appeared to Abraham.\" He invites them then, and washes their feet, and leads them forth at their departure, as though they were men; but he speaks as with the Lord God, whether when a son is promised to him, or when the destruction is shown to him that was impending over Sodom.[fn-5-P546_202680:72-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_08_concerning_two_souls_against_the_manichaeans_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"They might have cited against me those words of the gospel: \"Ye therefore do not hear, because ye are not of God;\" \"Ye are of your father the devil.\"[fn-7-P760_386713:10-nf] I also should have cited: \"All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made,\"[fn-7-P761_386835:11-nf] and this of the Apostle: \"One God of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things,\"[fn-7-P762_386966:12-nf] and again from the same Apostle: \"Of whom are all things, through whom are all things, in whom are all things, to Him be glory.\"[fn-7-P763_387116:13-nf] I should have exhorted those men (if indeed I had found them men), that we should presume upon nothing as if we had found it out, but should rather inquire of the masters who would demonstrate the agreement and harmony of those passages that seem to be discordant. For when in one and the same Scriptural authority we read: \"All things are of God,\"[fn-7-P764_387483:14-nf] and elsewhere: \"Ye are not of God,\" since it is wrong rashly to condemn books of Scripture, who would not have seen that a skilled teacher should be found who would know a solution of this problem, from whom assuredly if endowed with good intellectual powers, and a \"spiritual man,\" as is said by divine inspiration[fn-7-P765_387819:15-nf] (for he would necessarily have favored the true arguments concerning the intelligible and sensible nature, which, as far as I can, I have conducted and handled, nay he would have disclosed them far better and more convincingly); we should have heard nothing else concerning this problem, except, as might happen, that there is no class of souls but has its existence from God, and that it is yet rightly said to sinners and unbelievers: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we also, perchance, Divine aid having been implored, should have been able easily to see, that it is one thing to live and another to sin, and (although life in sin may be called death in comparison with just life,[fn-7-P766_388516:16-nf] and while in one man it may be found, that he is at the same time alive and a sinner) that so far as he is alive, he is of God, so far as he is a sinner he is not of God. In which division we use that alternative that suits our sentiment; so that when we wish to insist upon the omnipotence of God as Creator, we may say even to sinners that they are of God. For we are speaking to those who are contained in some class, we are speaking to those having animal life, we are speaking to rational beings, we are speaking lastly-and this applies especially to the matter in hand-to living beings, all which things are essentially divine functions. But when our purpose is to convict evil men, we rightly say: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we speak to them as averse to truth, unbelieving, criminal, infamous, and, to sum up all in one term-sinners, all of which things are undoubtedly not of God. Therefore what wonder is it, if Christ says to sinners, convicting them of this very thing that they were sinners and did not believe in Him: \"Ye are not of God;\" and on the other hand, without prejudice to the former statement: \"All things were made through Him,\" and \"All things are of God?\" For if not to believe Christ, to repudiate Christ's advent, not to accept Christ, was a sure mark of souls that are not of God; and so it was said: \"Ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God;\" how would that saying of the apostle be true that occurs in the memorable beginning of the gospel: \"He came unto his own things, and his own people did not receive him?\"[fn-7-P767_390086:17-nf] Whence his own if they did not receive him; or whence therefore not his own because they did not receive him, unless that sinners by virtue of being men belong to God, but by virtue of being sinners belong to the devil?

For instance, the phrase \"of which\" does not always and absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material,[fn-11-P1166_275824:20-nf] but it is more in accordance with the usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause, as in the words \"One God, of whom are all things,\"[fn-11-P1167_276074:21-nf] and again, \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1168_276783:22-nf] The word of truth has, however, frequently used this term in the case of the material, as when it says \"Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;\"[fn-11-P1169_276955:23-nf] and \"Thou shall make the candlestick of pure gold ;\"[fn-11-P1170_277028:24-nf] and \"The first man is of the earth, earthy;[fn-11-P1171_277426:25-nf] and \"Thou art formed out of clay as I am.\"[fn-11-P1172_277487:26-nf] But these men, to the end, as we have already remarked, that they may establish the difference of nature, have laid down the law that this phrase befits the Father alone. This distinction they have originally derived from heathen authorities, but here they have shewn no faithful accuracy of limitation. To the Son they have in conformity with the teaching of their masters given the title of instrument, and to the Spirit that of place, for they say in the Spirit, and through the Son. But when they apply \"of whom\" to God they no longer follow heathen example, but \"go over, as they say, to apostolic usage, as it is said, \"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,\"[fn-11-P1173_278169:27-nf] and \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1174_278219:28-nf] What, then, is the result of this systematic discussion? There is one nature of Cause; another of Instrument; another of Place. So the Son is by nature distinct from the Father, as the tool from the craftsman; and the Spirit is distinct in so far as place or time is distinguished from the nature of tools or from that of them that handle them.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Yes; but these are the words of a writer not laying down a rule, but carefully distinguishing the hypostases.[fn-11-P1181_279365:30-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":8,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_11_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"2","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"1.

Since, therefore, the words of the Apostle, One God the Father, from Whom are all things, and one Jesus Christ, our Lord, through Whom are all things[fn-12-P1233_749642:36-nf] , form an accurate and complete confession concerning God, let us see what Moses has to say of the beginning of the world. His words are, And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and let it divide the water from the water. And it was so, and God made the firmament and God divided the water through the midst[fn-12-P1234_749997:37-nf] . Here, then, you have the God from Whom, and the God through Whom. If you deny it, you must tell us through whom it was that God's work in creation was done, or else point for your explanation to an obedience in things yet uncreated, which, when God said Let there be a firmament, impelled the firmament to establish itself. Such suggestions are inconsistent with the clear sense of Scripture. For all things, as the Prophet says[fn-12-P1235_750447:38-nf] , were made out of nothing; it was no transformation of existing things, but the creation into a perfect form of the non-existent. Through whom? Hear the Evangelist: All things were made through Him. If you ask Who this is, the same Evangelist will tell you: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him[fn-12-P1236_750875:39-nf] . If you are minded to combat the view that it was the Father Who said, Let there be a firmament, the prophet will answer you: He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created[fn-12-P1237_751090:40-nf] . The recorded words, Let there be a firmament, reveal to us that the Father spoke. But in the words which follow, And it was so, in the statement that God did this thing, we must recognise the Person of the Agent. He spake, and they, were made; the Scripture does not say that He willed it, and did it. He commanded, and they were created; you observe that it does not say they came into existence, because it was His pleasure. In that case there would be no office for a Mediator between God and the world which was awaiting its creation. God, from Whom are all things, gives the order for creation which God, through Whom are all things, executes. Under one and the same Name we confess Him Who gave and Him Who fulfilled the command. If you dare to deny that God made is spoken of the Son, how do you explain All things were made through Him? Or the Apostle's words, One Jesus Christ, our Lord, through, Whom are all things? Or, He spake, and they were made? If these inspired words succeed in convincing your stubborn mind, you will cease to regard that text, Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One, as a refusal of Divinity to the Son of God, since at the very foundation of the world He Who spoke it proclaimed that His Son also is God. But let us see what increase of profit we may draw from this distinction of God Who commands and God Who executes. For though it is repugnant even to our natural reason to suppose that in the words, He commanded, and they were made, one single and isolated Person is intended, yet, for the avoidance of all doubts, we must expound the events which followed upon the creation of the world.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_11_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"39. As for the men of stature who shall come over to Him and follow Him in chains, there is no doubt who they are. Turn to the Gospels; Peter, when he is to follow his Lord, is girded up. Read the Apostles: Paul, the servant of Christ, boasts of his bonds. Let us see whether this `prisoner of Jesus Christ' conforms in his teaching to the prophecies uttered by God concerning God His Son. God hart said, They shall make supplication, for God is in Thee. Now mark and digest these words of the Apostle:-God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself[fn-13-P1300_788697:80-nf] . And then the prophecy continues, And there is no God beside Thee. The Apostle promptly matches this with For there is one Jesus Christ our Lord, through Whom are all things[fn-13-P1301_788891:81-nf] . Obviously there can be none other but He, for He is One. The third prophetic statement is, Thou art God and we knew it not.

For `we are a sweet savour of Christ in them that are being saved[fn-98-P9809_3502695:2-nf] ,' as the Apostle says. But since the devil's darts are varied and subtle, and he contrives to trouble those who are of simpler mind, and tries to hinder the ordinary exercises of the brethren, scattering secretly among them thoughts of uncleanness and defilement; come let us briefly dispel the error of the evil one by the grace of the Saviour, and confirm the mind of the simple. For `to the pure all things are pure,' but both the conscience and all that belongs to the unclean are defiled[fn-98-P9810_3503206:3-nf] . I marvel also at the craft of the devil, in that, although he is corruption and mischief itself, he suggests thoughts under the show of purity; but with the result of a snare rather than a test. For with the object, as I said before, of distracting ascetics from their customary and salutary meditation, and of appearing to overcome them, he stirs some such buzzing thoughts as are of no profit in life, vain questions and frivolities which one ought to put aside. For tell me, beloved and most pious friend, what sin or uncleanness there is in any natural secretion,-as though a man were minded to make a culpable matter of the cleanings of the nose or the sputa from the mouth? And we may add also the secretions of the belly, such as are a physical necessity of animal life. Moreover if we believe man to be, as the divine Scriptures say, a work of God's hands, how could any defiled work proceed from a pure Power? and if, according to the divine Acts of the Apostles[fn-98-P9811_3504195:4-nf] , `we are God's offspring,' we have nothing unclean in ourselves. For then only do we incur defilement, when we commit sin, that foulest of things. But when any bodily excretion takes place independently of will, then we experience this, like other things, by a necessity of nature. But since those whose only pleasure is to gainsay what is said aright, or rather what is made by God, pervert even a saying in the Gospels, alleging that `not that which goeth in defileth a man, but that which goeth out[fn-98-P9812_3504717:5-nf] ,' we are obliged to make plain this unreasonableness,-for I cannot call it a question-of theirs. For firstly, like unstable persons, they wrest the Scriptures[fn-98-P9813_3504894:6-nf] to their own ignorance. Now the sense of the divine oracle is as follows. Certain persons, like these of today, were in doubt about meats. The Lord Himself, to dispel their ignorance, or it may be to unveil their deceitfulness, lays down that, not what goes in defiles the man, but what goes out. Then he adds exactly whence they go out, namely from the heart. For there, as he knows, are the evil treasures of profane thoughts and other sins. But the Apostle teaches the same thing more concisely, saying, `But meat shall not bring us before God[fn-98-P9814_3505460:7-nf] .' Moreover, one might reasonably say no natural secretion will bring us before him for punishment. But possibly medical men (to put these people to shame even at the hands of outsiders) will support us on this point, telling us that there are certain necessary passages accorded to the animal body, to provide for the dismissal of the superfluity of what is secreted in our several parts; for example, for the superfluity of the head, the hair and the watery discharges from the head, and the purgings of the belly, and that superfluity again of the seminative channels. What sin then is there in God's name, elder most beloved of God, if the Master who made the body willed and made these parts to have such passages? But since we must grapple with the objections of evil persons, as they may say, `If the organs have been severally fashioned by the Creator, then there is no sin in their genuine use,' let us stop them by asking this question: What do you mean by use? That lawful use which God permitted when He said, `Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth[fn-98-P9815_3506549:8-nf] ,' and which the Apostle approves in the words, `Marriage is honourable and the bed undefiled[fn-98-P9816_3506658:9-nf] ,' or that use which is public, yet carried on stealthily and in adulterous fashion? For in other matters also which go to make up life, we shall find differences according to circumstances. For example, it is not right to kill, yet in war it is lawful and praiseworthy to destroy the enemy; accordingly not only are they who have distinguished themselves in the field held worthy of great honours, but monuments are put up proclaiming their achievements. So that the same act is at one time and under some circumstances unlawful, while under others, and at the right time, it is lawful and permissible. The same reasoning applies to the relation of the sexes. He is blessed who, being freely yoked in his youth, naturally begets children. But if he uses nature licentiously, the punishment of which the Apostle[fn-98-P9817_3507488:10-nf] writes shall await whoremongers and adulterers.","title":"Letter XLVIII. Letter to Amun .

For as a snake does not creep on with open steps, but advances by the very minutest efforts of its several scales; so the slippery motion of falling away [from what is good] takes possession of the negligent only gradually, and beginning from a perverse desire for the likeness of God, arrives in the end at the likeness of beasts. Hence it is that being naked of their first garment, they earned by mortality coats of skins.[fn-15-P1564_764595:28-nf] For-the true honor of man is the image and likeness of God, which is not preserved except it be in relation to Him by whom it is impressed. The less therefore that one loves what is one's own, the more one cleaves to God. But through the desire of making trial of his own power, man by his own bidding falls down to himself as to a sort of intermediate grade. And so, while he wishes to be as God is, that is, under no one, he is thrust on, even from his own middle grade, by way of punishment, to that which is lowest, that is, to those things in which beasts delight: and thus, while his honor is the likeness of God, but his dishonor is the likeness of the beast, \"Man being in honor abideth not: he is compared to the beasts that are foolish, and is made like to them.\"[fn-15-P1565_765388:29-nf] By what path, then, could he pass so great a distance from the highest to the lowest, except through his own intermediate grade?

Let him distinguish between knowledge and love, as they ought to be distinguished; because \"knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.\"[fn-33-P3354_1297158:73-nf] And then knowledge no longer puffeth up when love builds up. And inasmuch as each is the gift of God (although one is less, and the other greater), he must not extol our righteousness above the praise which is due to Him who justifies us, in such a way as to assign to the lesser of these two gifts the help of divine grace, and to claim the greater one for the human will. And should he consent that we receive love from the grace of God, he must not suppose that any merits of our own preceded our reception of the gift. For what merits could we possibly have had at the time when we loved not God? In order, indeed, that we might receive that love whereby we might love, we were loved while as yet we had no love ourselves. This the Apostle John most expressly declares: \"Not that we loved God,\" says he, \"but that He loved us;\"[fn-33-P3355_1298011:74-nf] and again, \"We love Him, because He first loved us.\"[fn-33-P3356_1298084:75-nf] Most excellently and truly spoken! For we could not have wherewithal to love Him, unless we received it from Him in His first loving us. And what good could we possibly do if we possessed no love? Or how could we help doing good if we have love? For although God's commandment appears sometimes to be kept by those who do not love Him, but only fear Him; yet where there is no love, no good work is imputed, nor is there any good work, rightly so called; because \"whatsoever is not of faith is sin,\"[fn-33-P3357_1298605:76-nf] and \"faith worketh by love.\"[fn-33-P3358_1298653:77-nf] Hence also that grace of God, whereby \"His love is shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us,\"[fn-33-P3359_1298795:78-nf] must be so confessed by the man who would make a true confession, as to show his undoubting belief that nothing whatever in the way of goodness pertaining to godliness and real holiness can be accomplished without it. Not after the fashion of him who clearly enough shows us what he thinks of it when he says, that \"grace is bestowed in order that what God commands may be the more easily fulfilled;\" which of course means, that even without grace God's commandments may, although less easily, yet actually, be accomplished.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_18_book_vii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"From his writings, I say, for I do not like to insert in my own work the nauseous stuff our rhetorician utters, or to display his ignorance and folly to contempt in the midst of my own arguments. He goes on with a sort of eulogy upon the class of significant words which express the subject, and, in his accustomed style, patches and sticks together the cast-off rags of phrases: poor Isocrates is nibbled at once more, and shorn of words and figures to make out the point proposed,-here and there even the Hebrew Philo receives the same treatment, and makes him a contribution of phrases from his own labours,-yet not even thus is this much-stitched and many-coloured web of words finished off, but every assault, every defence of his conceptions, all his artistic preparation, spontaneously collapses, and, as commonly happens with the bubbles when the drops, borne down from above through a body of waters against some obstacle, produce those foamy swellings which, as soon as they gather, immediately dissolve, and leave upon the water no trace of their own formation-such are the air-bubbles of our author's thoughts, vanishing without a touch at the moment they are put forth. For after all these irrefragable statements, and the dreamy philosophizing wherein he asserts that the distinct character of the essence is apprehended by the divergence of names, as some mass of foam borne downstream breaks up when it comes into contact with any more solid body, so his argument, following its own spontaneous course, and coming unexpectedly into collision with the truth, disperses into nothingness its unsubstantial and bubble-like fabric of falsehood. For he speaks in these words:-\"Who is so foolish and so far removed from the constitution of men, as, in discoursing of men to speak of one as a man, and, calling another a horse, so to compare them?\" I would answer him, -\"You are right in calling any one foolish who makes such blunders in the use of names. And I will employ for the support of the truth the testimony you yourself give. For if it is a piece of extreme folly to call one a horse and another a man, supposing both were really men, it is surely a piece of equal stupidity, when the Father is confessed to be God, and the Son is confessed to be God, to call the one `created' and the other `uncreated,' since, as in the other case humanity, so in this case the Godhead does not admit a change of name to that expressive of another kind. For what the irrational is with respect to man, that also the creature is with respect to the Godhead, being equally unable to receive the same name with the nature that is superior to it. And as it is not possible to apply the same definition to the rational animal and the quadruped alike (for each is naturally differentiated by its special property from the other), so neither can you express by the same terms the created and the uncreated essence, seeing that those attributes which are predicated of the latter essence are not discoverable in the former. For as rationality is not discoverable in a horse, nor solidity of hoofs in a man, so neither is Godhead discoverable in the creature, nor the attribute of being created in the Godhead: but if He be God He is certainly not created, and if He be created He is not God; unless[fn-17-P1773_1026836:21-nf] , of course, one were to apply by some misuse or customary mode of expression the mere name of Godhead, as some horses have men's names given them by their owners; yet neither is the horse a man, though he be called by a human name, nor is the created being God, even though some claim for him the name of Godhead, and give him the benefit of the empty sound of a dissyllable.\" Since, then, Eunomius' heretical statement is found spontaneously to fall in with the truth, let him take his own advice and stand by his own words, and by no means retract his own utterances, but consider that the man is really foolish and stupid who names the subject not according as it is, but says \"horse\" for \"man.\" and \"sea\" for \"sky,\" and \"creature\" for \"God.\" And let no one think it unreasonable that the creature should be set in opposition to God, but have regard to the prophets and to the Apostles. For the prophet says in the person of the Father, \"My Hand made all these things\"[fn-17-P1774_1027845:22-nf] , meaning by \"Hand,\" in his dark saying, the power of the Only-begotten. Now the Apostle says that all things are of the Father, and that all things are by the Son[fn-17-P1775_1028054:23-nf] , and the prophetic spirit in a way agrees with the Apostolic teaching, which itself also is given through the Spirit. For in the one passage, the prophet, when he says that all things are the work of the Hand of Him Who is over all, sets forth the nature of those things which have come into being in its relation to Him Who made them, while He Who made them is God over all, Who has the Hand, and by It makes all things. And again, in the other passage, the Apostle makes the same division of entities, making all things depend upon their productive cause, yet not reckoning in the number of \"all things\" that which produces them: so that we are hereby taught the difference of nature between the created and the uncreated, and it is shown that, in its own nature, that which makes is one thing and that which is produced is another. Since, then, all things are of God, and the Son is God, the creation is properly opposed to the Godhead; while, since the Only-begotten is something else than the nature of the universe (seeing that not even those who fight against the truth contradict this), it follows of necessity that the Son also is equally opposed to the creation, unless the words of the saints are untrue which testify that by Him all things were made.

But if he leans upon the support of the Scriptures, let him show one such declaration from the holy writings, and we will hold our peace. I hear Paul cry aloud, \"There is one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-19-P1988_1195164:33-nf] .\" But Eunomius shouts against Paul, calling Christ a slave. For we recognize no other mark of a slave than to be subject and controlled. The slave is assuredly a slave, but the slave cannot by nature be Lord, even though the term be applied to Him by inexact use. And why should I bring forward the declarations of Paul in evidence of the lordship of the Lord? For Paul's Master Himself tells His disciples that He is truly Lord, accepting as He does the confession of those who called Him Master and Lord. For He says, \"Ye call Me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am[fn-19-P1989_1195768:34-nf] .\" And in the same way He enjoined that the Father should be called Father by them, saying, \"Call no man master upon earth: for one is your Master, even Christ: and call no man father upon earth, for one is your Father, Which is in heaven[fn-19-P1990_1196034:35-nf] .\" To which then ought we to give heed, as we are thus hemmed in between them? On one side the Lord Himself, and he who has Christ speaking in him[fn-19-P1991_1196212:36-nf] , enjoin us not to think of Him as a slave, but to honour Him even as the Father is honoured, and on the other side Eunomius brings his suit against the Lord, claiming Him as a slave, when he says that He on Whose shoulders rests the government of the universe is under dominion. Can our choice what to do be doubtful, or is the decision which is the more advantageous course unimportant? Shall I slight the advice of Paul, Eunomius? shall I deem the voice of the Truth less trustworthy than thy deceit? But \"if I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin[fn-19-P1992_1196807:37-nf] .\" Since then, He has spoken to them, truly declaring Himself to be Lord, and that He is not falsely named Lord (for He says, \"I am,\" not \"I am called\"), what need is there that they should do that, whereon the vengeance is inevitable because they are forewarned?","title":"Book X","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Touching then the discussion of His flesh, and (through that) of His nativity, and incidentally[fn-50-P5021_1581473:210-nf] of His name Emmanuel, let this suffice. Concerning His other names, however, and especially that of Christ, what has the other side to say in reply? If the name of Christ is as common with you as is the name of God-so that as the Son of both Gods may be fitly called Christ, so each of the Fathers may be called Lord-reason will certainly be opposed to this argument. For the name of God, as being the natural designation of Deity, may be ascribed to all those beings for whom a divine nature is claimed,-as, for instance, even to idols. The apostle says: \"For there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth.\"[fn-50-P5022_1582113:211-nf] The name of Christ, however, does not arise from nature, but from dispensation;[fn-50-P5023_1582216:212-nf] and so becomes the proper name of Him to whom it accrues in consequence of the dispensation. Nor is it subject to be shared in by any other God, especially a rival, and one that has a dispensation of His own, to whom it will be also necessary that He should possess names apart from all others. For how happens it that, after they have devised different dispensations for two Gods they admit into this diversity of dispensation a community of names; whereas no proof could be more useful of two Gods being rival ones, than if there should be found coincident with their (diverse) dispensations a diversity also of names? For that is not a state of diverse qualities, which is not distinctly indicated[fn-50-P5024_1583052:213-nf] in the specific meanings[fn-50-P5025_1583097:214-nf] of their designations. Whenever these are wanting, there occurs what the Greeks call the katachresis[fn-50-P5026_1583220:215-nf] of a term, by its improper application to what does not belong to it.[fn-50-P5027_1583398:216-nf] In God, however, there ought, I suppose, to be no defect, no setting up of His dispensations by katachrestic abuse of words. Who is this god, that claims for his son names from the Creator? I say not names which do not belong to him, but ancient and well-known names, which even in this view of them would be unsuitable for a novel and unknown god. How is it, again, that he tells us that \"a piece of new cloth is not sewed on to an old garment,\" or that \"new wine is not trusted to old bottles,\"[fn-50-P5028_1583922:217-nf] when he is himself patched and clad in an old suit[fn-50-P5029_1583998:218-nf] of names? How is it he has rent off the gospel from the law, when he is wholly invested with the law,-in the name, forsooth, of Christ? What hindered his calling himself by some other name, seeing that he preached another (gospel), came from another source, and refused to take on him a real body, for the very purpose that he might not be supposed to be the Creator's Christ? Vain, however, was his unwillingness to seem to be He whose name he was willing to assume; since, even if he had been truly corporeal, he would more certainly escape being taken for the Christ of the Creator, if he had not taken on him His name. But, as it is, he rejects the substantial verity of Him whose name he has assumed, even though he should give a proof of that verity by his name. For Christ means anointed, and to be anointed is certainly an affair[fn-50-P5030_1584850:219-nf] of the body. He who had not a body, could not by any possibility have been anointed; he who could not by any possibility have been anointed, could not in any wise have been called Christ. It is a different thing (quite), if he only assumed the phantom of a name too. But how, he asks, was he to insinuate himself into being believed by the Jews, except through a name which was usual and familiar amongst them? Then 'tis a fickle and tricksty God whom you describe! To promote any plan bydeception, is the resource of either distrust or of maliciousness. Much more frank and simple was the conduct of the false prophets against the Creator, when they came in His name as their own God.[fn-50-P5031_1585551:220-nf] But I do not find that any good came of this proceeding,[fn-50-P5032_1585664:221-nf] since they were more apt to suppose either that Christ was their own, or rather was some deceiver, than that He was the Christ of the other god; and this the gospel will show.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_31_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_philippians","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Being mindful of your love and of your zeal in Christ, which ye have manifested towards us, we thought it fitting to write to you, who display such a godly and spiritual love to the brethren,[fn-28-P2853_462018:2-nf] to put you in remembrance of your Christian course,[fn-28-P2854_462142:3-nf] \"that ye all speak the same thing, being of one mind, thinking the same thing, and walking by the same rule of faith,\"[fn-28-P2855_462295:4-nf] as Paul admonished you.

Now that the words addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and Father, of Whom are all things[fn-20-P2094_1268713:8-nf] .\" Accordingly human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of foresight[fn-20-P2095_1269055:9-nf] , imports a certain relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father's image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, \"by nature were no Gods[fn-20-P2096_1269960:10-nf] ,\" and in the place of the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, \"The partridge called, she gathered together what she hatched not[fn-20-P2097_1270174:11-nf] .\" Since, then, this was the sum of our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature[fn-20-P2098_1270575:12-nf] . For human nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us[fn-20-P2099_1271124:13-nf] , and frees us from the curse by taking on Him our curse as His own[fn-21-P2100_1271215:14-nf] , and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle, \"slain\" in Himself \"the enmity[fn-21-P2101_1271328:15-nf] \" which by means of sin had come between us and God,-(in fact sin was \"the enmity\")-and having become what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God[fn-21-P2102_1271640:16-nf] , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-21-P2103_1271716:17-nf] , He drew with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day become disciples of the Word,-the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is hallowed[fn-21-P2104_1272237:18-nf] . \"For behold,\" He says, \"I and the children whom God hath given Me[fn-21-P2105_1272327:19-nf] .\" He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin[fn-21-P2106_1272542:20-nf] . And so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ's Humanity is a common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also \"shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air[fn-21-P2107_1273219:21-nf] ,\" even so, when we hear that the true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt hat we shall come to the same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner[fn-21-P2108_1273533:22-nf] . And the fact too that this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we have given For since, as the Apostle tells us, \"the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression[fn-21-P2109_1273771:23-nf] ,\" and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering[fn-21-P2110_1274235:24-nf] to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_28_book_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"8. The true bride of Christ, whom thou hast the audacity to taunt with the stone tablets, knows the difference between the letter and the spirit, or in other words, between law and grace; and serving God no longer in the oldness of the letter, but in newness of spirit, she is not under the law, but under grace. She is not blinded by a spirit of controversy, but learns meekly from the apostle what is this law which we are not to be under; for \"it was given, \"he says, \"on account of transgression, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.\"[fn-16-P1636_906298:18-nf] And again: \"It entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has much more abounded.\"[fn-16-P1637_906427:19-nf] Not that the law is sin, though it cannot give life without grace, but rather increases the guilt; for \"where there is no law, there is no transgression.\"[fn-16-P1638_906599:20-nf] The letter without the spirit, the law without grace, can only condemn. So the apostle explains his meaning, in case any should not understand: \"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. For I had not known sin but by the law. For I had not known lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the command-merit, deceived me, and by it slew me. Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-16-P1639_907217:21-nf] She at whom thou scoffest knows what this means; for she asks earnestly, and seeks humbly, and knocks meekly. She sees that no fault is found with the law, when it is said, \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,\" any more than with knowledge, when it is said, \"Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.\"[fn-16-P1640_907551:22-nf] The passage runs thus: \"We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.\" The apostle certainly had no desire to be puffed up; but he had knowledge, because knowledge joined with love not only does not puff up, but strengthens. So the letter when joined with the spirit, and the law when joined with grace, is no longer the letter and the law in the same sense as when by itself it kills by abounding sin. In this sense the law is even called the strength of sin, because its strict prohibitions increase the fatal pleasure of sin. Even thus, however, the law is not evil; but \"sin. that it may appear sin, works death by that which is good.\" So things that are not evil may often be hurtful to certain people. The Manichaeans, when they have sore eyes, will shut out their god the sun. The bride of Christ, then, is dead to the law, that is, to sin, which abounds more from the prohibition of the law; for the law apart from grace commands, but does not enable. Being dead to the law in this sense, that she may be married to another who rose from the dead, she makes this distinction without any reproach to the law, which would be blasphemy against its author. This is thy crime; for though the apostle tells thee that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good, thou dost not acknowledge it as the production of a good being. Its author thou makest to be one of the princes of darkness. Here the truth confronts thee. They are the words of the Apostle Paul: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" Such is the law given by Him who appointed for a great symbolical use the tablets which thou foolishly deridest. The same law which was given by Moses becomes through Jesus Christ grace and truth; for the spirit is joined to the letter, that the righteousness of the law might begin to be fulfilled, which when unfulfilled only added the guilt of transgression. The law which is holy, and just, and good, is the same law by which sin works death, and to which we must die, that we may be married to another who rose from the dead. Hear what the apostle adds: \"But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.\" Deaf and blind, dost thou not now hear and see? \"Sin wrought death in me,\" he says, \"by that which is good.\" The law is always good: whether it hurts those who are destitute of grace, or benefits those who are filled with grace, itself is always good; as the sun is always good, for every creature of God is good, whether it hurts weak eyes or gladdens the sight of the healthy. Grace fits the mind for keeping the law, as health fits the eyes for seeing the sun. And as healthy eyes die not to the pleasure of seeing the sun, but to that painful effect of the rays which beat upon the eye so as to increase the darkness; so the mind, healed by the love of the spirit, dies not to the justice of the law, but to the guilt and transgression which followed on the law in the absence of grace. So it is said \"The law is good, if used lawfully;\" and immediately after of the same law, \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man.\" The man who delights in righteousness itself, does not require the restraint of the letter.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"6.

But when he says, \"although there be that are called gods, whether in l heaven or in earth,\"[fn-74-P7480_2149111:315-nf] the meaning of his words is clear-not as if there were gods in reality, but as if there were some who are called gods, without being truly so. He introduces his discussion about meats offered to idols with a statement concerning idols (themselves): \"We know that an idol is nothing in the world.\"[fn-74-P7481_2149431:316-nf] Marcion, however, does not say that the Creator is not God; so that the apostle can hardly be thought to have ranked the Creator amongst those who are called gods, without being so; since, even if they had been gods, \"to us there is but one God, the Father.\"[fn-74-P7482_2149713:317-nf] Now, from whom do all things come to us, but from Him to whom all things belong?

From Him, therefore, amongst the \"all things\" comes also Christ.[fn-74-P7484_2150275:319-nf] When he teaches that every man ought to live of his own industry,[fn-74-P7485_2150364:320-nf] he begins with a copious induction of examples-of soldiers, and shepherds, and husbandmen.[fn-74-P7486_2150477:321-nf] But he[fn-74-P7487_2150505:322-nf] wanted divine authority. What was the use, however, of adducing the Creator's, which he was destroying? It was vain to do so; for his god had no such authority! (The apostle) says: \"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,\"[fn-74-P7488_2150779:323-nf] and adds: \"Doth God take care of oxen? \"Yes, of oxen, for the sake of men!

(He showed) also, that those who preach the gospel are on this account sent by no other god but Him to whom belongs the law, which made provision for them, when he says: \"For our sakes was this writ. ten.\"[fn-74-P7490_2151306:325-nf] Still he declined to use this power which the law gave him, because he preferred working without any restraint.[fn-74-P7491_2151474:326-nf] Of this he boasted, and suffered no man to rob him of such glory[fn-74-P7492_2151554:327-nf] -certainly with no view of destroying the law, which he proved that another man might use.

To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also \"the Father of mercies,\"[fn-76-P7669_2195768:492-nf] and (in the prophets) has been described as \"full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.\"[fn-76-P7670_2195892:493-nf] In Jonah you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.[fn-76-P7671_2196035:494-nf] How inflexible was He at the tears of Hezekiah![fn-76-P7672_2196104:495-nf] How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.[fn-76-P7673_2196231:496-nf] How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin[fn-76-P7674_2196318:497-nf] -preferring, indeed, the sinner's repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.[fn-76-P7675_2196454:498-nf] Now, if Marcion's god has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be \"the Father of mercies.\" Since, however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we on our side, too,[fn-76-P7676_2196811:499-nf] adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"20.

For how does it prevent our understanding it to have the following passage thus expressed: \"Quae est terra in qua isti insidunt super eam, si bona est an nequam; el quoe sunt civitates, in quibus ipsi inhabitant in ipsis?\"[fn-48-P4890_2642667:30-nf] And I am more disposed to think that this is simply the idiom of another language than that any deeper meaning is intended. Again, that phrase, which we cannot now take away from the lips of the people who sing it: \"Super ipsum autem floriet sanctificatio mea,\"[fn-48-P4891_2643069:31-nf] surely takes away nothing from the meaning. Yet a more learned man would prefer that this should be corrected, and that we should say, not floriet, but florebit. Nor does anything stand in the way of the correction being made, except the usage of the singers. Mistakes of this kind, then, if a man do not choose to avoid them altogether, it is easy to treat with indifference, as not interfering with a right understanding.

For not only is such a form of speech faulty in the Latin tongue, but it is ambiguous too, as if the meaning might be, that the folly of men or the weakness of men is wiser or stronger than that of God. But indeed even the expression sapientius est hominibus (stronger than men) is not free from ambiguity, even though it be free from solecism. For whether hominibus is put as the plural of the dative or as the plural of the ablative, does not appear, unless by reference to the meaning.

Now Christ is our passover sacrificed for us,[fn-50-P5028_2710050:69-nf] and there is nothing the sacrifice of Christ more clearly teaches us than the call which He himself addresses to those whom He sees toiling in Egypt under Pharaoh: \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

For what other estimate[fn-82-P8220_2329769:43-nf] of God is there than eternity? What other condition has eternity than to have ever existed, and to exist yet for evermore by virtue of its privilege of having neither beginning nor end?

Else, what will be unique and singular, if that is not which has nothing equal to it? What will be principal, if that is not which is above all things, before all things, and from which all things proceed? By possessing these He is God alone, and by His sole possession of them He is One. If another also shared in the possession, there would then be as many gods as there were possessors of these attributes of God. Hermogenes, therefore, introduces two gods: he introduces Matter as God's equal. God, however, must be One, because that is God which is supreme; but nothing else can be supreme than that which is unique; and that cannot possibly be unique which has anything equal to it; and Matter will be equal with God when it is held to be[fn-82-P8226_2331607:49-nf] eternal.","title":"Against Hermogenes.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Further, we have to ask in what sense He is called in the Apocalypse the First and the Last, and how, in His character as the First, He is not the same as the Alpha and the beginning, while in His character as the Last He is not the same as the Omega and the end. It appears to me, then, that the reasonable beings which exist are characterized by many forms, and that some of them are the first, some the second, some the third, and so on to the last. To pronounce exactly, however, which is the first, what kind of a being the second is, which may truly be designated third, and to carry this out to the end of the series, this is not a task for man, but transcends our nature. We shall yet venture, such as we are, to stand still a little at this point, and to make some observations on the matter. There are some gods of whom God is god, as we hear in prophecy,[fn-63-P6345_1012512:150-nf] \"Thank ye the God of gods,\" and[fn-63-P6346_1012566:151-nf] \"The God of gods hath spoken, and called the earth.\" Now God, according to the Gospel,[fn-63-P6347_1012670:152-nf] \"is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" Those gods, then, are living of whom God is god. The Apostle, too, writing to the Corinthians, says:[fn-63-P6348_1012839:153-nf] \"As there are gods many and lords many,\" and so we have spoken of these gods as really existing. Now there are, besides the gods of whom God is god, certain others, who are called thrones, and others called dominions, lordships, also, and powers in addition to these. The phrase,[fn-63-P6349_1013142:154-nf] \"above every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come,\" leads us to believe that there are yet others besides these which are less familiar to us; one kind of these the Hebrews called Sabai, from which Sabaoth was formed, who is their ruler, and is none other than God. Add to all these the reasonable being who is mortal, man. Now the God of all things made first in honour some race of reasonable beings; this I consider to be those who are called gods, and the second order, let us say, for the present, are the thrones, and the third, undoubtedly, the dominions. And thus we come down in order to the last reasonable race, which, perhaps, cannot be any other than man. The Saviour accordingly became, in a diviner way than Paul, all things to all, that He might either gain all or perfect them; it is clear that to men He became a man, and to the angels an angel. As for His becoming man no believer has any doubt, but as to His becoming an angel, we shall find reason for believing it was so, if we observe carefully the appearances and the words of the angels, in some of which the powers of the angels seem to belong to Him. In several passages angels speak in such a way as to suggest this, as when[fn-63-P6350_1014407:155-nf] \"the angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire. And he said. I am the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.\" But Isaiah also says:[fn-63-P6351_1014570:156-nf] \"His name is called Angel of Great Counsel.\" The Saviour, then, is the first and the last, not that He is not what lies between, but the extremities are named to show that He became all things. Consider, however, whether the last is man, or the things said to be under the earth, of which are the demons, all of them or some. We must ask, too, about those things which the Saviour became which He speaks of through the prophet David,[fn-63-P6352_1015023:157-nf] \"And I became as a man without any to help him, free among the dead.\" His birth from the Virgin and His life so admirably lived showed Him to be more than man, and it was the same among the dead. He was the only free person there, and His soul was not left in hell. Thus, then, He is the first and the last. Again, if there be letters of God, as such there are, by reading which the saints may say they have read what is written on the tablets of heaven, these letters, by which heavenly things are to be read, are the notions, divided into small parts, into A and so on to W, the Son of God. Again, He is the beginning and the end, but He is this not in all His aspects equally. For He is the beginning, as the Proverbs teach us, inasmuch as He is wisdom; it is written: \"The Lord rounded Me in the beginning of His ways. for His works.\" In the respect of His being the Logos He is not the beginning. \"The Word was in the beginning.\" Thus in His aspects one comes first and is the beginning, and there is a second after the beginning, and a third, and so on to the end, as if He had said, I am the beginning. inasmuch as I am wisdom, and the second, perhaps, inasmuch as I am invisible, and the third in that I am life, for \"what was made was life in Him.\" One who was qualified to examine and to discern the sense of Scripture might, no doubt, find many members of the series; I cannot say if he could find them all. \"The beginning and the end\" is a phrase we usually apply to a thing that is a completed unity; the beginning of a house is its foundation and the end the parapet. We cannot but think of this figure. since Christ is the stone which is the head of the corner, to the great unity of the body of the saved. For Christ the only-begotten Son is all and in all, He is as the beginning in the man He assumed, He is present as the end in the last of the saints, and He is also in those between, or else He is present as the beginning in Adam, as the end in His life on earth, according to the saying: \"The last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\" This saying harmonizes well with the interpretation we have given of the first and the last.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_39_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But those enemies of grace never endeavour to lay more secret snares for more vehement opposition to that same grace than when they praise the law, which, without doubt, is worthy to be praised.[fn-56-P5626_2213002:27-nf] Because, by their different modes of speaking, and by variety of words in all their arguments, they wish the law to be understood as \"grace\"-that, to wit, we may have from the Lord God the help of knowledge, whereby we may know those things which have to be done,-not the inspiration of love, that, when known, we may do them with a holy love, which is properly grace.

Now, we may say that it is that process of reason which, from what is admitted, procures faith in what is disputed. Now, faith being twofold-the faith of knowledge and that of opinion-nothing prevents us from calling demonstration twofold, the one resting on knowledge, the other on opinion; since also knowledge and foreknowledge are designated as twofold, that which is essentially accurate, that which is defective. And is not the demonstration, which we possess, that alone which is true, as being supplied out of the divine Scriptures, the sacred writings, and out of the \"God-taught wisdom,\" according to the apostle? Learning, then, is also obedience to the commandments, which is faith in God. And faith is a power of God, being the strength of the truth. For example, it is said, \"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall remove the mountain.\"[fn-57-P5796_1761286:109-nf] And again, \"According to thy faith let it be to thee.\"[fn-57-P5797_1761364:110-nf] And one is cured, receiving healing by faith; and the dead is raised up in consequence of the power of one believing that he would be raised. The demonstration, however, which rests on opinion is human, and is the result of rhetorical arguments or dialectic syllogisms. For the highest demonstration, to which we have alluded, produces intelligent faith by the adducing and opening up of the Scriptures to the souls of those who desire to learn; the result of which is knowledge (gnosis). For if what is adduced in order to prove the point at issue is assumed to be true, as being divine and prophetic, manifestly the conclusion arrived at by inference from it will consequently he inferred truly; and the legitimate result of the demonstration will be knowledge. When, then, the memorial of the celestial and divine food was commanded to be consecrated in the golden pot, it was said, \"The omer was the tenth of the three measures.\"[fn-57-P5798_1762320:111-nf] For in ourselves, by the three measures are indicated three criteria; sensation of objects of sense, speech,-of spoken names and words, and the mind,-of intellectual objects. The Gnostic, therefore, will abstain from errors in speech, and thought, and sensation, and action, having heard \"that he that looks so as to lust hath committed adultery; \"[fn-57-P5799_1762735:112-nf] and reflecting that \"blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; \"[fn-58-P5800_1762833:113-nf] and knowing this, \"that not what enters into the mouth defileth, but that it is what cometh forth by the mouth that defileth the man. For out of the heart proceed thoughts.\"[fn-58-P5801_1763032:114-nf] This, as I think, is the true and just measure according to God, by which things capable of measurement are measured, the decad which is comprehensive of man; which summarily the three above-mentioned measures pointed out. There are body and soul, the five senses, speech, the power of reproduction-the intellectual or the spiritual faculty, or whatever you choose to call it. And we must, in a word, ascending above all the others, stop at the mind; as also certainly in the universe overleaping the nine divisions, the first consisting of the four elements put in one place for equal interchange: and then the seven wandering stars and the one that wanders not, the ninth, to the perfect number, which is above the nine,[fn-58-P5802_1763774:115-nf] and the tenth division, we must reach to the knowledge of God, to speak briefly, desiring the Maker after the creation.

For there are not many words, or each would be imperfect, but one is the Word, that He only may be perfect, and because, God being one, His Image too must be one, which is the Son. For the Son of God, as may be learnt from the divine oracles themselves, is Himself the Word of God, and the Wisdom, and the Image, and the Hand, and the Power; for God's offspring is one, and of the generation from the Father these titles are tokens[fn-33-P3343_1318765:118-nf] .

Solomon also received the same from God, and said, `The Lord by wisdom founded the earth[fn-33-P3347_1320751:122-nf] ,' and John, knowing that the Word was the Hand and the Wisdom, thus preached, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made[fn-33-P3348_1321040:123-nf] .' And the Apostle, seeing that the Hand and the Wisdom and the Word was nothing else than the Son, says, `God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also He made the ages[fn-33-P3349_1321391:124-nf] .' And again, `There is one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him[fn-33-P3350_1321515:125-nf] .'

For when he calls Him Father, he shows them to be sons; and when he says sons, he has unveiled the whole treasure of blessings.","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":8,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_67_xvii_the_second_conference_of_abbot_joseph_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Instructed by which examples, the blessed Apostle James also, and all the chief princes of the primitive Church urged the Apostle Paul in consequence of the weakness of feeble persons to condescend to a fictitious arrangement and insisted on his purifying himself according to the requirements of the law, and shaving his head and paying his vows, as they thought that the present harm which would come from this hypocrisy was of no account, but had regard rather to the gain which would result from his still continued preaching.

Do you ask also where for the good of those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing: \"As I passed by,\" he says, \"I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown God;\" and when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the faith of Christ, saying: \"What therefore ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.\" And after a little, as if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ, saying: \"As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.\" And when he had thus approached them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by things false, he added and said: \"Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of man.\"[fn-59-P5935_2102689:24-nf] But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again,[fn-59-P5936_2102865:25-nf] or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling.[fn-59-P5937_2103021:26-nf] But he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he says: \"He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth:\"and: \"He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better;\" and elsewhere: \"Who,\" says he, \"is weak, and I am not weak?

And although this was done with the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it right to believe that he who had said: \"For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,\"[fn-59-P5940_2104934:29-nf] would himself fall into what he had condemned.

Do you ask also where for the good of those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing: \"As I passed by,\" he says, \"I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown God;\" and when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the faith of Christ, saying: \"What therefore ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.\" And after a little, as if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ, saying: \"As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.\" And when he had thus approached them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by things false, he added and said: \"Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of man.\"[fn-59-P5935_2102689:24-nf] But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again,[fn-59-P5936_2102865:25-nf] or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling.[fn-59-P5937_2103021:26-nf] But he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he says: \"He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth:\"and: \"He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better;\" and elsewhere: \"Who,\" says he, \"is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?\" and in this way he fulfilled what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: \"Be ye without offence to Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit but that of the many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-59-P5938_2103712:27-nf] For it had certainly been profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going barefoot,[fn-59-P5939_2103935:28-nf] not to pay legal vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done with the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it right to believe that he who had said: \"For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,\"[fn-59-P5940_2104934:29-nf] would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to such an extent is account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the disposition of the doer, that on the other hand truth is sometimes found to have injured some, and a lie to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants about David's flight, and saying: \"Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make you all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me,\" did Doeg the Edomite say anything but the truth, when he told him: \"I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, who consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the Philistine?\"[fn-59-P5941_2105735:30-nf] For which true story he deserved to be rooted up out of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the prophet: \"Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck thee up and tear thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the living:\"[fn-59-P5942_2106018:31-nf] He then for showing the truth is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the harlot Rahab with her family is planted for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson most injuriously betrayed to his wicked wife the truth which he had hidden for a long time by a lie, and therefore the truth so inconside-rately disclosed was the cause of his own deception, because he had neglected to keep the command of the prophet: \"Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.\"[fn-59-P5943_2106543:32-nf] ","title":"XVII.

What is it, then, that He adds? \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.\" Let us say to Him (for He permits us, not contradicting Him, but desiring to know), O Lord, good Master, in what way does the flesh profit nothing, whilst Thou hast said, \"Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he shall not have life in him?\" Or does life profit nothing? And why are we what we are, but that we may have eternal life, which Thou dost promise by Thy flesh? Then what means \"the flesh profiteth nothing\"? It profiteth nothing, but only in the manner in which they understood it. They indeed understood the flesh, just as when cut to pieces in a carcass, or sold in the shambles; not as when it is quickened by the Spirit. Wherefore it is said that \"the flesh profiteth nothing,\" in the same manner as it is said that \"knowledge puffeth up.\" Then, ought we at once to hate knowledge? Far from it! And what means \"Knowledge puffeth up\"? Knowledge alone, without charity. Therefore he added, \"but charity edifieth.\"[fn-13-P1318_834049:4-nf] Therefore add thou to knowledge charity, and knowledge will be profitable, not by itself, but through charity. So also here, \"the flesh profiteth nothing,\" only when alone. Let the Spirit be added to the flesh, as charity is added to knowledge, and it profiteth very much. For if the flesh profiled nothing, the Word would not be made flesh to dwell among us. If through the flesh Christ has greatly profiled us, does the flesh profit nothing? But it is by the flesh that the Spirit has done somewhat for our salvation. Flesh was a vessel; consider what it held, not what it was. The apostles were sent forth; did their flesh profit us nothing? If the apostles' flesh profited us, could it be that the Lord's flesh should have profiled us nothing? For how should the sound of the Word come to us except by the voice of the flesh? Whence should writing come to us? All these are operations of the flesh, but only when the spirit moves it, as if it were its organ. Therefore \"it is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing,\" as they understood the flesh, but not so do I give my flesh to be eaten.","title":"Tractate XXVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_80_homily_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"For I could wish that I myself were accursed.\" What does the \"I myself\" mean? It means I that have been a teacher (1 Cor. ix. 27) of all, that have gathered together countless good deeds, that am waiting for countless crowns, that desired Him so much, as to value His love above all things, who all my days am burning for Him, and hold all things (Phil. iii. 8) of second importance to the love of Him. For even being loved by Christ was not the only thing he cared for, but loving Him exceedingly also. And this last he cared most for (toutou malista hn). So it was that he looked to this only, and took all things light-heartedly. For he kept one aim in view in all circumstances, the fulfilling of this excellent love. And this he wishes for. But since things were not to take this course, nor he to become accursed,[fn-27-P2753_2623689:8-nf] he next attempts to go into a defence against the charges, and so to bring what was bruited abroad by all before them as to overthrow it. And before he openly enters into his defence against these, he first lays down some seeds of it beforehand. For when he says, \"to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the giving of the Law, and the service of God, and the promises,\" he does but say that God willed them indeed to be saved, and this he showed by His former dealings, and by Christ's having sprung from them, and by what He promised to the Fathers. But they out of their own untreatable temper thrust the benefit away from them. And this is also the reason of his setting down such things as set forth God's gift, not such as were encomiums upon them. For the adoption came of His grace, and so too the glory, and the promises, and the Law. After taking all these things then into consideration, and reflecting how earnest God along with His Son, had been for their salvation, he lifts up his voice aloud, and says, \"Who is[fn-27-P2754_2624863:9-nf] blessed forever.

Now the Son is all this, who says, `I am the Life[fn-54-P5423_2127145:123-nf] ,' and, `I Wisdom dwell with prudence[fn-54-P5424_2127203:124-nf] .'

But a fountain it would then cease to be; for what begetteth not from itself, is not a fountain[fn-54-P5425_2127474:125-nf] . What a load of extravagance! for God promises that those who do His will shall be as a fountain which the water fails not, saying by Isaiah the prophet, `And the Lord shall satisfy thy soul in drought, and make thy bones fat; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not[fn-54-P5426_2127811:126-nf] .' And yet these, whereas God is called and is a Fountain of wisdom, dare to insult Him as barren and void of His proper Wisdom. But their doctrine is false; truth witnessing that God is the eternal Fountain of His proper Wisdom; and, if the Fountain be eternal, the Wisdom also must needs be eternal. For in It were all things made, as David says in the Psalm, `In Wisdom bast Thou made them all[fn-54-P5427_2128231:127-nf] ;' and Solomon says, `The Lord by Wisdom hath formed the earth, by understanding hath He established the heavens[fn-54-P5428_2128364:128-nf] .' And this Wisdom is the Word, and by Him, as John says, `all things were made,' and `without Him was made not one thing[fn-54-P5429_2128508:129-nf] .' And this Word is Christ; for `there is One God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for Him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him[fn-54-P5430_2128754:130-nf] .' And if all things are through Him, He Himself is not to be reckoned with that `all' For he who dares[fn-54-P5431_2128881:131-nf] to call Him, through whom are things, one of that `all,' surely will have like speculations concerning God, from whom are all. But if he shrinks from this as unseemly, and excludes God from that all, it is but consistent that he should also exclude from that all the Only-Begotten Son, as being proper to the Father's essence. And, if He be not one of the all[fn-54-P5432_2129281:132-nf] , it is sin to say concerning Him, `He was not,' and `He was not before His generation.' Such words may be used of the creatures; but as to the Son, He is such as the Father is, of whose essence He is proper Offspring, Word, and Wisdom[fn-54-P5433_2129538:133-nf] . For this is proper to the Son, as regards the Father, and this shews that the Father is proper to the Son; that we may neither say that God was ever without Word[fn-54-P5434_2129723:134-nf] , nor that the Son was non-existent.

Therefore if by the Hand of God the works are wrought, and it is written that `all things were made through the Word,' and `without Him was not made one thing[fn-63-P6387_2544442:491-nf] ,' and again, `One Lord Jesus, through whom are all things[fn-63-P6388_2544518:492-nf] ,' and `in Him all things consist[fn-63-P6389_2544575:493-nf] ,' it is very plain that the Son cannot be a work, but He is the Hand[fn-63-P6390_2544664:494-nf] of God and the Wisdom. This knowing, the martyrs in Babylon, Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, arraign the Arian irreligion. For when they say, `O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord,' they recount things in heaven, things on earth, and the whole creation, as works; but the Son they name not.

This too the Spirit has declared in the Psalms with a most apposite distinction, `the Word of the Lord is true, and all His works are faithful[fn-63-P6392_2545677:496-nf] ;' as in another Psalm too He says, `O Lord, how manifold are Thy works! in Wisdom hast Thou made them all[fn-63-P6393_2545806:497-nf] .'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4.

For they are one, not[fn-65-P6527_2591364:29-nf] as one thing divided into two parts, and these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father[fn-65-P6528_2591708:30-nf] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike[fn-65-P6529_2591781:31-nf] its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the Son's[fn-65-P6530_2591995:32-nf] .

And such an offspring is necessarily one light; and no one would say that they are two lights[fn-65-P6532_2592732:34-nf] , but sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and none other but He.

Where but in the holy womb of the Virgin, where at His Incarnation, the Word of God is said to have been made flesh, at His birth He truly took the form of a servant; and when He is in human nature nailed to the Cross, He became poor, and was made poor in His sufferings in the flesh, though He was rich in His Divine glory? Otherwise if, as you say, at some later period the Deity entered into Him as into one of the Prophets and saints, then \"the Word was made flesh\" in those men also in whom He vouch-soled to dwell: then in each one of them He emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of a servant.

And how can we read of so close a union of man and God, as to make it appear that man was ever co-eternal with God, and that afterwards God suffered with man: whereas we cannot believe that man can be without beginning or that God can suffer? It is this which we established in our previous writings; viz., that God being joined to manhood,[fn-74-P7412_2719346:37-nf] i.e., to His own body, does not allow any separation to be made in men's thoughts between man and God. Nor will He permit anyone to hold that there is one Person of the Son of man, and another Person of the Son of God. But in all the holy Scriptures He joins together and as it were incorporates in the Godhead, the Lord's manhood,[fn-74-P7413_2719699:38-nf] so that no one can sever man from God in time, nor God from man at His Passion. For if you regard Him in time, you will find that the Son of man is ever with the Son of God. If you take note of His Passion, you will find that the Son of God is ever with the Son of man, and that Christ theSon of man and the Son of God is so one and indivisible, that, in the language of holy Scripture, the man cannot be severed in time from God, nor God from man at His Passion. Hence comes this: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-74-P7414_2720311:39-nf] Where the Son of God while He was speaking on earth testified that the Son of man was in heaven: and testified that the same Son of man, who, He said, would ascend into heaven, had previously come down from heaven. And this: \"What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before,\"[fn-74-P7415_2720630:40-nf] where He gives the name of Him who was born of man, but affirms that He ever was up on high. And the Apostle also, when considering what happened in time, says that all things were made by Christ. For he says, \"There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.\"[fn-74-P7416_2720919:41-nf] But when speaking of His Passion, he shows that the Lord of glory was crucified. \"For if,\" he says, \"they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-74-P7417_2721133:42-nf] And so too the Creed speaking of the only and first-begotten Lord Jesus Christ, \"Very God of Very God, Being of one substance with the Father, and the Maker of all things,\" affirms that He was born of the Virgin and crucified and afterwards buried. Thus joining in one body (as it were) the Son of God and of man, and uniting God and man, so that there can be no severance either in time or at the Passion, since the Lord Jesus Christ is shown to be one and the same Person, both as God through all eternity, and as man through the endurance of His Passion; and though we cannot say that man is without beginning orthat God is passible, yet in the one Person of the Lord Jesus Christ we can speak of man as eternal, and of God as dead. You see then that Christ means the whole Person, and that the name represents both natures, for both man and God are born, and so it takes in the whole Person so that when this name is used we see that no part is left out. There was not then before the birth of a Virgin the same eternity belonging in the past to the manhood as to the Divinity, but because Divinity was united to manhood in the womb of the Virgin, it follows that when we use the name of Christ one cannot be spoken of without the other.","title":"Book VI.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_85_book_vii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"For as,\" you say, \"by man came death, so by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\" Do\nyou actually try to prove your wrong and impious notion by the witness of the Apostle?

But the Bishops, beholding their craftiness, and the cunning of their impiety, expressed more plainly the sense of the words `of God,' by writing that the Son is of the Essence of God, so that whereas the Creatures, since they do not exist of themselves without a cause, but have a beginning of their existence, are said to be `of God,' the Son alone might be deemed proper to the Essence of the Father.

In the first place, therefore, dearest brother, both by overseers and people nothing is to be more eagerly sought after, than that we who fear God should keep the divine precepts with every observation of discipline, and should not suffer our brethren to stray, and to live according to their own fancy and lust;[fn-59-P5932_1861369:6-nf] but that we should faithfully consult for the life of each one, and not stiffer virgins to dwell with men,-I do not say to sleep together, but to live together[fn-59-P5933_1861688:7-nf] -since both their weak sex and their age, still critical, ought to be bridled in all things and ruled by us, lest an occasion should be given to the devil who ensnares us, and desires to rage over us, to hurt them, since the apostle also says, \"Do not give place to the devil.\"[fn-59-P5934_1862064:8-nf] The ship is watchfully to be delivered from perilous places, that it may not be broken among the rocks and cliffs; the baggage must swiftly be taken out of the fire, before it is burnt up by the flames reaching it. No one who is near to danger is long safe, nor will the servant of God be able to escape the devil if he has entangled himself in the devil's nets. We must interfere at once with such as these, that they may be separated while yet they can be separated in innocence; because by and by they will not be able to be separated by our interference, after they have become joined together by a very guilty conscience. Moreover, what a number of serious mischiefs we see to have arisen hence; and what a multitude of virgins we behold corrupted by unlawful and dangerous conjunctions of this kind, to our great grief of mind! But if they have faithfully dedicated themselves to Christ, let them persevere in modesty and chastity, without incurring any evil report, and so in courage and steadiness await the reward of virginity. But if they are unwilling or unable to persevere, it is better that they should marry, than that by their crimes they should fall into the fire. Certainly let them not cause a scandal to the brethren or sisters, since it is written, \"If meat cause my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.\"[fn-59-P5935_1863468:9-nf] ","title":"Epistle LXI.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_231_letter_ccxiii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1. May the Lord, Who has brought me prompt help in my afflictions, grant you the help of the refreshment wherewith you have refreshed me by writing to me, rewarding you for your consolation of my humble self with the real and great gladness of the Spirit. For I was indeed downcast in soul when I saw in a great multitude the almost brutish and unreasonable insensibility of the people, and the inveterate and ineradicable unsatisfactoriness of their leaders. But I saw your letter; I saw the treasure of love which it contained; then I knew that He Who ordains all our lives had made some sweet consolation shine on me in the bitterness of my life. I therefore salute your holiness in return, and exhort you, as is my wont, not to cease to pray for my unhappy life, that I may never, drowned in the unrealities of this world, forget God, \"who raiseth up the poor out of the dust;\"[fn-51-P5128_1603249:2-nf] that I may never be lifted up with pride and fall into the condemnation of the devil;[fn-51-P5129_1603353:3-nf] that I may never be found by the Lord neglectful of my stewardship and asleep; never discharging it amiss, and wounding the conscience of my fellow-servants;[fn-51-P5130_1603533:4-nf] and, never companying with the drunken, suffer the pains threatened in God's just judgment against wicked stewards.

We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,[fn-26-P2661_896588:9-nf] nor unlike[fn-26-P2662_896638:10-nf] the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality[fn-26-P2663_897082:11-nf] is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called \"god\" as in the words, \"I have said ye are gods,\"[fn-26-P2664_897294:12-nf] and \"daemon\" as in the words, \"The gods of the nations are daemons,\"[fn-26-P2665_897383:13-nf] in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone is substantially and essentially God. When I say \"alone\" I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and substance of God. For the word \"alone\" is used in the case of any individual and generally of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and \"heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-26-P2666_897874:14-nf] and of human nature, as when David says, \"as for man his days are as grass,\"[fn-26-P2667_897971:15-nf] not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, \"who alone hath immortality\"[fn-26-P2668_898174:16-nf] and \"to God only wise,\"[fn-26-P2669_898218:17-nf] and \"none is good save one, that is God,\"[fn-26-P2670_898279:18-nf] for here \"one\" means the same as alone. So also, \"which alone spreadest out the heavens,\"[fn-26-P2671_898390:19-nf] and again \"Thou shall worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-26-P2672_898486:20-nf] \"There is no God beside me.\"[fn-26-P2673_898690:21-nf] In Scripture \"one\" and \"only\" are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so called.As for instance, \"The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them,\"[fn-26-P2674_898962:22-nf] and \"then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and didserve the Lord only.\"[fn-26-P2675_899086:23-nf] And so St. Paul, \"For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but out god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things.\"[fn-26-P2676_899285:24-nf] Here we enquire why when he had said \"one God\" he was not content, for we have said that \"one\" and \"only\" when applied to God, indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase \"one God.\" without, by the further addition of \"the Father,\" expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifyings the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of \"Jesus Christ,\" and charges His disciples to \"tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ.\"[fn-26-P2677_900209:25-nf] For His purpose was, after the completion of the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2678_900288:26-nf] after His resurrection froth the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words \"That they may know Thee the only true God and JesUs Christ whom thou hast sent,\"[fn-26-P2679_900611:27-nf] and again \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me.\"[fn-26-P2680_900681:28-nf] Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in else direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2681_900878:29-nf] and so by omission falling into impiety.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
