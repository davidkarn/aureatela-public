Knowledge puffeth up:  but charity edifieth.","And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet\nknown as he ought to know.","But if any man love God, the same is known by him.","But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an\nidol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.","For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on\nearth (for there be gods many and lords many):","Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all\nthings, and we unto him:  and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all\nthings, and we by him.","But there is not knowledge in every one.  For some until this\npresent, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an\nidol:  and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.","But meat doth not commend us to God.
