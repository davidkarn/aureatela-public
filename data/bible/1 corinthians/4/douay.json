{"verses":["Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the\ndispensers of the mysteries of God.","Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found\nfaithful.","But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man's\nday.  But neither do I judge my own self.","For I am not conscious to myself of anything.  Yet am I not hereby\njustified:  but he that judgeth me is the Lord.","Therefore, judge not before the time:  until the Lord come, who\nboth will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make\nmanifest the counsels of the hearts.  And then shall every man have\npraise from God.","But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to\nmyself and to Apollo, for your sakes:  that in us you may learn that one\nbe not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is\nwritten.","For who distinguisheth thee?  Or what hast thou that thou hast not\nreceived, and if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou\nhadst not received it?","You are now full:  you are now become rich:  you reign without us;\nand I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.","For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it\nwere men appointed to death.  We are made a spectacle to the world and\nto angels and to men.","We are fools for Christs sake, but you are wise in Christ:  we are\nweak, but you are strong:  you are honourable, but we without honour.","Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and\nare buffeted and have no fixed abode.","And we labour, working with our own hands.  We are reviled:  and we\nbless.  We are persecuted:  and we suffer it.","We are blasphemed:  and we entreat.  We are made as the refuse of\nthis world, the offscouring of all, even until now.","I write not these things to confound you:  but I admonish you as\nmy dearest children.","For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many\nfathers.  For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.","Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of\nChrist.","For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son\nand faithful in the Lord.  Who will put you in mind of my ways, which\nare in Christ Jesus:  as I teach every where in every church.","As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.","But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will:  and will know,\nnot the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.","For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.","What will you?  Shall I come to you with a rod?  Or in charity and\nin the spirit of meekness?"]}
