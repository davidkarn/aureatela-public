If it is for a man's sake, let us again consider that all idolatry is for man's sake;[fn-7-P768_315582:115-nf] let us again consider that all idolatry is a worship done to men, since it is generally agreed even among their worshippers that aforetime the gods themselves of the nations were men; and so it makes no difference whether that superstitious homage be rendered to men of a former age or of this. Idolatry is condemned, not on account of the persons which are set up for worship, but on account of those its observances, which pertain to demons. \"The things which are Cµsar's are to be rendered to Cµsar.\"[fn-7-P769_316123:116-nf] It is enough that He set in apposition thereto, \"and to God the things which are God's.\" What things, then, are Cµsar's?

Otherwise, what will be God's, if all things are Cµsar's? \"Then,\" do you say, \"the lamps before my doors, and the laurels on my posts are an honour to God? \"They are there of course, not because they are an honour to God, but to him who is honour in God's stead by ceremonial observances of that kind, so far as is manifest, saving the religious performance, which is in secret appertaining to demons.

For some, with their turbans and woollen bands, do not veil their head, but bind it up; protected, indeed, in front, but, where the head properly lies, bare. Others are to a certain extent covered over the region of the brain with linen coifs of small dimensions-I suppose for fear of pressing the head-and not reaching quite to the ears. If they are so weak in their hearing as not to be able to hear through a covering, I pity them. Let them know that the whole head constitutes \"the woman.\"[fn-6-P673_167816:59-nf] Its limits and boundaries reach as far as the place where the robe begins. The region of the veil is co-extensive with the space covered by the hair when unbound; in order that the necks too may be encircled. For it is they which must be subjected, for the sake of which \"power\" ought to be \"had on the head: \"the veil is their yoke. Arabia's heathen females will be your judges, who cover not only the head, but the face also, so entirely, that they are content, with one eye free, to enjoy rather half the light than to prostitute the entire face. A female would rather see than be seen. And for this reason a certain Roman queen said that they were most unhappy, in that they could more easily fall in love than be fallen in love with; whereas they are rather happy, in their immunity from that second (and indeed more frequent) infelicity, that females are more apt to be fallen in love with than to fall in love. And the modesty of heathen discipline, indeed, is more simple, and, so to say, more barbaric. To us the Lord has, even by revelations, measured the space for the veil to extend over. For a certain sister of ours was thus addressed by an angel, beating her neck, as if in applause: \"Elegant neck, and deservedly bare! it is well for thee to unveil thyself from the head fight down to the loins, lest withal this freedom of thy neck profit thee not!\" And, of course, what you have said to one you have said to all. But how severe a chastisement will they likewise deserve, who, amid (the recital of) the Psalms, and at any mention of (the name of) God, continue uncovered; (who) even when about to spend time in prayer itself, with the utmost readiness place a fringe, or a tuft, or any thread whatever, on the crown of their heads, and suppose themselves to be covered? Of so small extent do they falsely imagine their head to be! Others, who think the palm of their hand plainly greater than any fringe or thread, misuse their head no less; like a certain (creature), more beast than bird, albeit winged, with small head, long legs, and moreover of erect carriage. She, they say, when she has to hide, thrusts away into a thicket her head alone-plainly the whole of it, (though)-leaving all the rest of herself exposed. Thus, while she is secure in head, (but) bare in her larger pans, she is taken wholly, head and all. Such will be their plight withal, covered as they are less than is useful.","title":"III.

For there are three things which go to complete sin: the suggestion of, the taking pleasure in, and the consenting to. Suggestion takes place either by means of memory, or by means of the bodily senses, when we see, or hear, or smell, or taste, or touch anything. And if it give us pleasure to enjoy this, this pleasure, if illicit, must be restrained. Just as when we are fasting, and on seeing food the appetite of the palate is stirred up, this does not happen without pleasure; but we do not consent to this liking, and[fn-3-P383_103081:109-nf] we repress it by the right of reason, which has the supremacy. But if consent shall take place, the sin will be complete, known to God in our heart, although it may not become known to men by deed. There are, then, these steps: the suggestion is made, as it were, by a serpent, that is to say, by a fleeting and rapid, i.e. a temporary, movement of bodies: for if there are also any such images moving about in the soul, they have been derived from without from the body; and if any hidden sensation of the body besides those five senses touches the soul, that also is temporary and fleeting; and therefore the more clandestinely it glides in, so as to affect the process of thinking, the more aptly is it compared to a serpent. Hence these three stages, as I was beginning to say, resemble that transaction which is described in Genesis, so that the suggestion and a certain measure of suasion is put forth, as it were, by the serpent; but the taking pleasure in it lies in the carnal appetite, as it were in Eve; and the consent lies in the reason, as it were in the man: and these things having been acted through, the man is driven forth, as it were, from paradise, i.e. from the most blessed light of righteousness, into death[fn-3-P384_104364:110-nf] -in all respects most righteously. For he who puts forth suasion does not compel. And all natures are beautiful in their order, according to their gradations; but we must not descend from the higher, among which the rational mind has its place assigned, to the lower. Nor is any one compelled to do this; and therefore, if he does it, he is punished by the just law of God, for he is not guilty of this unwillingly. But yet, previous to habit, either there is no pleasure, or it is so slight that there is hardly any; and to yield to it is a great sin, as such pleasure is unlawful. Now, when any one does yield, he commits sin in the heart. If, however, he also proceeds to action, the desire seems to be satisfied and extinguished; but afterwards, when the suggestion is repeated, a greater pleasure is kindled, which, however, is as yet much less than that which by continuous practice is converted into habit. For it is very difficult to overcome this; and yet even habit itself, if one does not prove untrue to himself, and does not shrink back in dread from the Christian warfare, he will get the better of under His (i.e. Christ's) leadership and assistance; and thus, in accordance with primitive peace and order, both the man is subject to Christ, and the woman is subject to the man.[fn-3-P385_105676:111-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_08_concerning_two_souls_against_the_manichaeans_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"They might have cited against me those words of the gospel: \"Ye therefore do not hear, because ye are not of God;\" \"Ye are of your father the devil.\"[fn-7-P760_386713:10-nf] I also should have cited: \"All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made,\"[fn-7-P761_386835:11-nf] and this of the Apostle: \"One God of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things,\"[fn-7-P762_386966:12-nf] and again from the same Apostle: \"Of whom are all things, through whom are all things, in whom are all things, to Him be glory.\"[fn-7-P763_387116:13-nf] I should have exhorted those men (if indeed I had found them men), that we should presume upon nothing as if we had found it out, but should rather inquire of the masters who would demonstrate the agreement and harmony of those passages that seem to be discordant. For when in one and the same Scriptural authority we read: \"All things are of God,\"[fn-7-P764_387483:14-nf] and elsewhere: \"Ye are not of God,\" since it is wrong rashly to condemn books of Scripture, who would not have seen that a skilled teacher should be found who would know a solution of this problem, from whom assuredly if endowed with good intellectual powers, and a \"spiritual man,\" as is said by divine inspiration[fn-7-P765_387819:15-nf] (for he would necessarily have favored the true arguments concerning the intelligible and sensible nature, which, as far as I can, I have conducted and handled, nay he would have disclosed them far better and more convincingly); we should have heard nothing else concerning this problem, except, as might happen, that there is no class of souls but has its existence from God, and that it is yet rightly said to sinners and unbelievers: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we also, perchance, Divine aid having been implored, should have been able easily to see, that it is one thing to live and another to sin, and (although life in sin may be called death in comparison with just life,[fn-7-P766_388516:16-nf] and while in one man it may be found, that he is at the same time alive and a sinner) that so far as he is alive, he is of God, so far as he is a sinner he is not of God. In which division we use that alternative that suits our sentiment; so that when we wish to insist upon the omnipotence of God as Creator, we may say even to sinners that they are of God. For we are speaking to those who are contained in some class, we are speaking to those having animal life, we are speaking to rational beings, we are speaking lastly-and this applies especially to the matter in hand-to living beings, all which things are essentially divine functions. But when our purpose is to convict evil men, we rightly say: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we speak to them as averse to truth, unbelieving, criminal, infamous, and, to sum up all in one term-sinners, all of which things are undoubtedly not of God. Therefore what wonder is it, if Christ says to sinners, convicting them of this very thing that they were sinners and did not believe in Him: \"Ye are not of God;\" and on the other hand, without prejudice to the former statement: \"All things were made through Him,\" and \"All things are of God?\" For if not to believe Christ, to repudiate Christ's advent, not to accept Christ, was a sure mark of souls that are not of God; and so it was said: \"Ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God;\" how would that saying of the apostle be true that occurs in the memorable beginning of the gospel: \"He came unto his own things, and his own people did not receive him?\"[fn-7-P767_390086:17-nf] Whence his own if they did not receive him; or whence therefore not his own because they did not receive him, unless that sinners by virtue of being men belong to God, but by virtue of being sinners belong to the devil?

All these things are tokens of the devil. Such an one Rome groaned over some time back in Antimus; and Sophronius is a still more recent instance. Such persons, when they have once gained admission to the houses of the high-born, and have deceived \"silly women laden with sins, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,\"[fn-8-P848_172750:561-nf] feign a sad mien and pretend to make long fasts while at night they feast in secret. Shame forbids me to say more, for my language might appear more like invective than admonition. There are others-I speak of those of my own order-who seek the presbyterate and the diaconate simply that they may be able to see women with less restraint. Such men think of nothing but their dress; they use perfumes freely, and see that there are no creases in their leather shoes. Their curling hair shows traces of the tongs; their fingers glisten with rings; they walk on tiptoe across a damp road, not to splash their feet. When you see men acting in this way, think of them rather as bridegrooms than as clergymen. Certain persons have devoted the whole of their energies and life to the single object of knowing the names, houses, and characters of married ladies. I will here briefly describe the head of the profession, that from the master's likeness you may recognize the disciples. He rises and goes forth with the sun; he has the order of his visits duly arranged; he takes the shortest road; and, troublesome old man that he is, forces his way almost into the bedchambers of ladies yet asleep. If he sees a pillow that takes his fancy or an elegant table-cover-or indeed any article of household furniture-he praises it, looks admiringly at it, takes it into his hand, and, complaining that he has nothing of the kind, begs or rather extorts it from the owner. All the women, in fact, fear to cross the news-carrier of the town. Chastity and fasting are alike distasteful to him. What he likes is a savory breakfast-say off a plump young crane such as is commonly called a cheeper. In speech he is rude and forward, and is always ready to bandy reproaches. Wherever you turn he is the first man that you see before you. Whatever news is noised abroad he is either the originator of the rumor or its magnifier.

For it is not now my intention to argue against all his opinions. Origen has not lived in my day, nor has he robbed me. I have not conceived a dislike to him nor quarrelled with him because of an inheritance or of any worldly matter; but-to speak plainly-I grieve, and grieve bitterly, to see numbers of my brothers, and of those in particular who show the most promise, and have reached the highest rank in the sacred ministry,[fn-18-P1839_448541:1285-nf] deceived by his persuasive arguments, and made by his most perverse teaching the food of the devil, whereby the saying is fulfilled: \"He derides every stronghold, and his fare is choice, and he hath gathered captives as the sand.\"[fn-18-P1840_448794:1286-nf] But may God free you, my brother, and the holy people of Christ which is intrusted to you, and all the brothers who are with you, and especially the presbyter Rufinus, from the heresy of Origen, and other heresies, and from the perdition to which they lead. For, if for one word or for two opposed to the faith many heresies have been rejected by the Church, how much more shall he be held a heretic who has contrived such perverse interpretations and such mischievous doctrines to destroy the faith, and has in fact declared himself the enemy of the Church! For, among other wicked things, he has presumed to say this, too, that Adam lost the image of God, although Scripture nowhere declares that he did. Were it so, never would all the creatures in the world be subject to Adam's seed-that is, to the entire human race; yet, in the words of the apostle, everything \"is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind.\"[fn-18-P1841_449738:1287-nf] For never would all things be subjected to men if men had not-together with their authority over all-the image of God. But the divine Scripture conjoins and associates with this the grace of the blessing which was conferred upon Adam and upon the generations which descended from him. No one can by twisting the meaning of words presume to say that this grace of God was given to one only, and that he alone was made in the image of God (he and his wife, that is, for while he was formed of clay she was made of one of his ribs), but that those who were subsequently conceived in the womb and not born as was Adam did not possess God's image, for the Scripture immediately subjoins the following statement: \"And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years,[fn-18-P1842_450513:1288-nf] and knew Eve his wife, and she bare him a son in his image and after his likeness, and called his name Seth.\"[fn-18-P1843_450707:1289-nf] And again, in the tenth generation, two thousand two hundred and forty-two years afterwards,[fn-18-P1844_450845:1290-nf] God, to vindicate His own image and to show that the grace which He had given to men still continued in them, gives the following commandment: \"Flesh ...with the blood thereof shall ye not eat. And surely your blood will I require at the hand of every man that sheddeth it; for in the image of God have I made man.\"[fn-18-P1845_451264:1291-nf] From Noah to Abraham ten generations passed away,[fn-18-P1846_451362:1292-nf] and from Abraham's time to David's, fourteen more,[fn-18-P1847_451438:1293-nf] and these twenty-four generations make up, taken together, two thousand one hundred and seventeen years.[fn-18-P1848_451565:1294-nf] Yet the Holy Spirit in the thirty-ninth[fn-18-P1849_451663:1295-nf] psalm, while lamenting that all men walk in a vain show, and that they are subject to sins, speaks thus: \"For all that every man walk eth in the image.\"[fn-18-P1850_451891:1296-nf] Also after David's time, in the reign of Solomon his son, we read a somewhat similar reference to the divine likeness. For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: \"God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity.\"[fn-18-P1851_452211:1297-nf] And again, about eleven hundred and eleven years afterwards, we read in the New Testament that men have not lost the image of God. For James, an apostle and brother of the Lord, whom I have mentioned above-that we may not be entangled in the snares of Origen-teaches us that man does possess God's image and likeness. For, after a somewhat discursive account of the human tongue, he has gone on to say of it: \"It is an unruly evil ...therewith bless we God, even the Father and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.\"[fn-18-P1852_452779:1298-nf] Paul, too, the \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-18-P1853_452836:1299-nf] who in his preaching has fully maintained the doctrine of the gospel, instructs us that man is made in the image and after the likeness of God. \"A man,\" he says, \"ought not to wear long hair, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.\"[fn-18-P1854_453099:1300-nf] He speaks of \"the image\" simply, but explains the nature of the likeness by the word \"glory.\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":11,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1111","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"18.

When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach her to her face, she used to chant the words of the psalter: \"While the wicked was before me, I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good:\"[fn-40-P4045_1089387:2902-nf] and again, \"I as a deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth:\"[fn-40-P4046_1089505:2903-nf] and \"I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\"[fn-40-P4047_1089604:2904-nf] When she felt herself tempted, she dwelt upon the words in Deuteronomy: \"The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\"[fn-40-P4048_1089828:2905-nf] In tribulations and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: \"Ye that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope: yet a little while must these things be by reason of the malice of the lips and by reason of a spiteful tongue.\" This passage of scripture she explained for her own consolation as meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to receive hope upon hope. She recalled to mind also the words of the apostle, \"we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed\"[fn-40-P4049_1090606:2906-nf] and \"though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day\":[fn-40-P4050_1090709:2907-nf] and \"our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us[fn-40-P4051_1090790:2908-nf] an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.[fn-40-P4052_1091033:2909-nf] She used to say that, although to human impatience the time might seem slow in coming, yet that it would not be long but that presently help would come from God who says: \"In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.\"[fn-40-P4053_1091316:2910-nf] We ought not, she declared, to dread the deceitful lips and tongues of the wicked, for we rejoice in the aid of the Lord who warns us by His prophet: \"fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool\":[fn-40-P4054_1091661:2911-nf] and she quoted His own words, \"In your patience ye shall win your souls\":[fn-40-P4055_1091763:2912-nf] as well as those of the apostle, \"the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed? us\":[fn-40-P4056_1091932:2913-nf] and in another place, \"we are to suffer affliction\"[fn-40-P4057_1092012:2914-nf] that we may be patient in all things that befall us, for \"he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\"[fn-40-P4058_1092194:2915-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":11,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1548","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"It is usual in the monasteries of Egypt and Syria for virgins and widows who have vowed themselves to God and have renounced the world and have trodden under foot its pleasures, to ask the mothers of their communities to cut their hair; not that afterwards they go about with heads uncovered in defiance of the apostle's command,[fn-55-P5598_1563584:3979-nf] for they wear a close-fitting cap and a veil.

It is usual, therefore, to ask what He means, when He says: \"But ye, when ye fast, anoint your head, and wash your faces, that ye appear not unto men to fast.\" For it would not be right in any one to teach (although we may wash our face according to daily custom) that we ought also to have our heads anointed when we fast. If, then, all admit this to be most unseemly, we must understand this precept with respect to anointing the head and washing the face as referring to the inner man.[fn-7-P762_287509:110-nf] Hence, to anoint the head refers to joy; to wash the face, on the other hand, refers to purity: and therefore that man anoints his head who rejoices inwardly in his mind and reason. For we rightly understand that as being the head which has the pre-eminence in the soul, and by which it is evident that the other parts of man are ruled and governed. And this is done by him who does not seek his joy from without, so as to draw his delight in a fleshly way from the praises of men. For the flesh, which ought to be subject, is in no way the head of the whole nature of man. \"No man,\" indeed, \"ever yet hated his own flesh,\" as the apostle says, when giving the precept as to loving one's wife;[fn-7-P763_288244:111-nf] but the man is the head of the woman, and Christ is the head of the man.[fn-7-P764_288340:112-nf] Let him, therefore, rejoice inwardly in his fasting[fn-7-P765_288413:113-nf] in this very circumstance, that by his fasting he so turns away from the pleasure of the world as to be subject to Christ, who according to this precept desires to have the head anointed. For thus also he will wash his face, i.e. cleanse his heart, with which he shall see God, no veil being interposed on account of the infirmity contracted from squalor; but being firm and stedfast, inasmuch as he is pure and guileless. \"Wash you,\" says He, \"make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.\"[fn-7-P766_289047:114-nf] From the squalor, therefore, by which the eye of God is offended, our face is to be washed.

[We believe] also in the Holy Spirit, that is to say the Comforter, whom, having promised to his apostles after his ascension into the heavens, to teach them, and bring all thinks to their remembrance, he sent; by whom also the souls of those who have sincerely believed in him are sanctified. But those who affirm that the Son is of things which are not, or of another substance, and not of God, and that there was a time or an age when he was not, the holy and catholic Church recognizes to be aliens. We therefore again say, if any one affirms that the Father and Son are two Gods, let him be anathema. And if any one admits that Christ is God and the Son of God before the ages, but does not confess that he ministered to the Father in the formation of all things, let him be anathema. If any one shall dare to assert that the Unbegotten, or a part of him, was born of Mary, let him be anathema. If any one should say that the Son was of Mary according to foreknowledge, and not that he was with God, begotten of the Father before the ages, and that all things were not made by him, let him be anathema. If any one affirms the essence of God to be dilated or contracted, let him be anathema. If any one says that the dilated essence of God makes the Son, or shall term the Son the dilatation of his essence, let him be anathema. If any one calls the Son of God the internal or uttered word, let him be anathema. If any one declares that the Son that was born of Mary was man only, let him be anathema.

If any one hearing \"the Word was made flesh,\"[fn-8-P805_339555:101-nf] should imagine that the Word was changed into flesh, or that he underwent any change in assuming flesh, let him be anathema. If any one hearing that the only-begotten Son of God was crucified, should say that his divinity underwent any corruption, or suffering, or change, or diminution, or destruction, let him be anathema.

For he neither came down to the body[fn-8-P808_340988:104-nf] without his Father's will; nor did he rain from himself, but from the Lord (i.e. the Father) who exercises supreme authority: nor does he sit at the Father's right hand of himself, but in obedience to the Father saying, \"Sit thou at my right hand\"[fn-8-P809_341363:105-nf] [let him be anathema]. If any one should say that the Father, Son, and Holy? Spirit are one person, let him be anathema. If any one, speaking of the Holy Spirit the Comforter, shall call him the unbegotten God, let him be anathema.

If any one say that the Son of God was made as one of the creatures by the will of God, let him be anathema. If any one shall say that the Son was begotten without the Father's will, let him be anathema: for the Father did not, as compelled by any natural necessity, beget the Son at a time when he was unwilling; but as soon as it pleased him, he has declared that of himself without time and without passion, he begot him.

Moreover, to give an accurate conception of Christian doctrine, we again say, that if any one shall not declare Christ Jesus to have been the Son of God before all ages, and to have ministered to the Father in the creation of all things; but shall affirm that from the time only when he was born of Mary, was he called the Son and Christ, and that he then received the commencement of his divinity, let him be anathema, as the Samosatan.'[fn-8-P812_343295:108-nf] Another Exposition of the Faith set forth at Sirmium in Latin, and afterwards translated into Greek.[fn-8-P813_343440:109-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":11,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"244","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Macedonius on being ejected from Constantinople, bore his condemnation ill and became restless; he therefore associated himself with the other faction that had deposed Acacius and his party at Seleucia, and sent a deputation to Sophronius and Eleusius, to encourage them to adhere to that creed which was first promulgated at Antioch, and afterwards confirmed at Seleucia, proposing to give it the counterfeit[fn-9-P976_431494:185-nf] name of the `homoiousian' creed.[fn-9-P977_431825:186-nf] By this means he drew around him a great number of adherents, who from him are still denominated `Macedonians.' And although such as dissented from the Acacians at the Seleucian Synod had not previously used the term homoiousios, yet from that period they distinctly asserted it. There was, however, a popular report that this term did not originate with Macedonius, but was the invention rather of Marathonius, who a little before had been set over the church at Nicomedia; on which account the maintainers of this doctrine were also called `Marathonians.' To this party Eustathius joined himself, who for the reasons before stated had been ejected from the church at Sebastia. But when Macedonius began to deny the Divinity of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, Eustathius said: `I can neither admit that the Holy Spirit is God, nor can I dare affirm him to be a creature.' For this reason those who hold the homoousion of the Son call these heretics `Pneumatomachi.'[fn-9-P978_432828:187-nf] By what means these Macedonians became so numerous in the Hellespont, I shall state in its proper place.[fn-9-P979_432994:188-nf] The Acacians meanwhile became extremely anxious that another Synod should be convened at Antioch, in consequence of having changed their mind respecting their former assertion of the likeness `in all things' of the Son to the Father. A small number of them therefore assembled in the following consulate[fn-9-P980_433311:189-nf] which was that of Taurus and Florentius, at Antioch in Syria, where the emperor was at that time residing, Euzoïus being bishop. A discussion was then renewed on some of those points which they had previously determined, in the course of which they declared that the term `homoios' ought to be erased from the form of faith which had been published both at Ariminum and Constantinople; and they no longer concealed but openly declared that the Son was altogether unlike the Father, not merely in relation to his essence, but even as it respected his will i asserting boldly also, as Arius had already done, that he was made of nothing. Those in that city who favored the heresy of Aëtius, gave, their assent to this opinion; from which circumstance in addition to the general appellation of Arians, they were also termed `Anomoeans,'[fn-9-P981_434161:190-nf] and `Exucontians,'[fn-9-P982_434297:191-nf] by those at Antioch who embraced the homoousian, who nevertheless were at that time divided among themselves on account of Meletius, as I have before observed. Being therefore questioned by them, how they dared to affirm that the Son is unlike the Father, and has his existence from nothing, after having acknowledged him `God of God' in their former creed? they endeavored to elude this objection by such fallacious subterfuges as these. `The expression, \"God of God,\"' said they, `is to be understood in the same sense as the words of the apostle,[fn-9-P983_435058:192-nf] \"but all things of God.\" Wherefore the Son is of God, as being one of these all things: and it is for this reason the words \"according to the Scriptures\" are added in the draught of the creed.' The author of this sophism was George bishop of Laodicea, who being unskilled in such phrases, was ignorant of the manner in which Origen had formerly explained these peculiar expressions of the apostle, having thoroughly investigated the matter. But notwithstanding these evasive cavilings, they were unable to bear the reproach and contumely they had drawn upon themselves, and fell back upon the creed which they had before put forth at Constantinople; and so each one retired to his own district. George returning to Alexandria, resumed his authority over the churches there, Athanasius still not having made his appearance. Those in that city who were opposed to his sentiments he persecuted; and conducting himself with great severity and cruelty, he rendered himself extremely odious to the people. At Jerusalem Arrenius[fn-9-P984_436102:193-nf] was placed over the church instead of Cyril: we may also remark that Heraclius was ordained bishop there after him, and after him Hilary. At length, however, Cyril returned to Jerusalem, and was again invested with the presidency over the church there. About the same time another heresy sprang up, which arose from the following circumstance.","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":11,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"No doubt all they imitate Adam who by disobedience transgress the commandment of God; but he is one thing as an example to those who sin because they choose; and another thing as the progenitor of all who are born with sin.

And since we are showing how we can say the Father alone, because there is no Father in the Godhead except Himself, we must consider also the opinion which holds that the only true God is not the Father alone, but the leather and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For if any one should ask whether the Father alone is God, how can it be replied that He is not, unless perhaps we were to say that the Father indeed is God, but that He is not God alone, but that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are God alone? But then what shall we do with that testimony of the Lord? For He was speaking to the Father, and had named the Father as Him to whom He was speaking, when He says, \"And this is life eternal, that they may know Thee the one true God.\"[fn-11-P1152_475316:18-nf] And this the Arians indeed usually take, as if the Son were not true God. Passing them by, however, we must see whether, when it is said to the Father, \"That they may know Thee the one true God,\" we are forced to understand it as if He wished to intimate that the Father alone is the true God; lest we should not understand any to be God, except the three together, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Are we therefore, from the testimony of the Lord, both to call the Father the one true God, and the Son the one true God, and the Holy Spirit the one true God, and the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together, that is, the Trinity itself together, not three true Gods but one true God? Or because He added, \"And Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent,\" are we to supply \"the one true God;\" so that the order of the words is this, \"That they may know Thee, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent, the one true God?\" Why then did He omit to mention the Holy Spirit? Is it because it follow's, that whenever we name One who cleaves to One by a harmony so great that through this harmony both are one, this harmony itself must be understood, although it is not mentioned? For in that place, too, the apostle seems as it were to pass over the Holy Spirit; and yet there, too, He is understood, where he says, \"All are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.\"[fn-11-P1153_476695:19-nf] And again, \"The head of the woman is the man, the head of the man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God.\"[fn-11-P1154_476829:20-nf] But again, if God is only all three together, how can God be the head of Christ, that is, the Trinity the head of Christ, since Christ is in the Trinity in order that it may be the Trinity? Is that which is the Father with the Son, the head of that which is the Son alone? For the Father with the Son is God, but the Son alone is Christ: especially since it is the Word already made flesh that speaks; and according to this His humiliation also, the Father is greater than He, as He says, \"for my Father is greater than I;\"[fn-11-P1155_477372:21-nf] so that the very being of God, which is one to Him with the Father, is itself the head of the man who is mediator, which He is alone.[fn-11-P1156_477525:22-nf] For if we rightly call the mind the chief thing of man, that is, as it were the head of the human substance, although the man himself together with the mind is man; why is not the Word with the Father, which together is God, much more suitably and much more the head of Christ, although Christ as man cannot be understood except with the Word which was made flesh? But this, as we have already said, we shall consider somewhat more carefully hereafter. At present the equality and one and the same substance of the Trinity has been demonstrated as briefly as possible, that in whatever way that other question be determined, the more rigorous discussion of which we have deferred, nothing may hinder us from confessing the absolute equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"6. We acknowledge that the word of truth has in many places made use of these expressions; yet we absolutely deny that the freedom of the Spirit is in bondage to the pettiness of Paganism. On the contrary, we maintain that Scripture varies its expressions as occasion requires, according to the circumstances of the case. For instance, the phrase \"of which\" does not always and absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material,[fn-11-P1166_275824:20-nf] but it is more in accordance with the usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause, as in the words \"One God, of whom are all things,\"[fn-11-P1167_276074:21-nf] and again, \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1168_276783:22-nf] The word of truth has, however, frequently used this term in the case of the material, as when it says \"Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;\"[fn-11-P1169_276955:23-nf] and \"Thou shall make the candlestick of pure gold ;\"[fn-11-P1170_277028:24-nf] and \"The first man is of the earth, earthy;[fn-11-P1171_277426:25-nf] and \"Thou art formed out of clay as I am.\"[fn-11-P1172_277487:26-nf] But these men, to the end, as we have already remarked, that they may establish the difference of nature, have laid down the law that this phrase befits the Father alone. This distinction they have originally derived from heathen authorities, but here they have shewn no faithful accuracy of limitation. To the Son they have in conformity with the teaching of their masters given the title of instrument, and to the Spirit that of place, for they say in the Spirit, and through the Son. But when they apply \"of whom\" to God they no longer follow heathen example, but \"go over, as they say, to apostolic usage, as it is said, \"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,\"[fn-11-P1173_278169:27-nf] and \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1174_278219:28-nf] What, then, is the result of this systematic discussion?

The dispensation of our God and Saviour concerning man is a recall from the fall and a return from the alienation caused by disobedience to close communion with God. This is the mason for the sojourn of Christ in the flesh, the pattern life described in the Gospels, the sufferings, the cross, the tomb, the resurrection; so that the man who is being saved through imitation of Christ receives that old adoption. For perfection of life the imitation of Christ is necessary, not only in the example of gentleness,[fn-15-P1524_371731:298-nf] lowliness, and long suffering set us in His life, but also of His actual death. So Paul, the imitator of Christ,[fn-15-P1525_371865:299-nf] says, \"being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1526_372254:300-nf] How then are we made in the likeness of His death?[fn-15-P1527_372330:301-nf] In that we were buried[fn-15-P1528_372379:302-nf] with Him by baptism. What then is the manner of the burial? And what is the advantage resulting from the imitation? First of all, it is necessary that the continuity of the old life be cut. And this is impossible less a man be born again, according to the Lord's word;[fn-15-P1529_372670:303-nf] for the regeneration, as indeed the name shews, is a beginning of a second life. So before beginning the second, it is necessary to put an end to the first. For just as in the case of runners who turn and take the second course,[fn-15-P1530_372956:304-nf] a kind of halt and pause intervenes between the movements in the opposite direction, so also inmaking a change in lives it seemed necessary for death to come as mediator between the two, ending all that goes before, and beginning all that comes after. How then do we achieve the descent into hell? By imitating, through baptism, the burial of Christ. For the bodies of the baptized are, as it were, buried in the water. Baptism then symbolically signifies the putting off of the works of the flesh; as the apostle says, ye were \"circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism.\" And there is, as it were, a cleansing of the soul from the filth[fn-15-P1531_373733:305-nf] that has grown on it from the carnal mind,[fn-15-P1532_373982:306-nf] as it is written, \"Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\"[fn-15-P1533_374080:307-nf] On this account we do not, as is the fashion of the Jews, wash ourselves at each defilement, but own the baptism of salvation[fn-15-P1534_374233:308-nf] to be one.[fn-15-P1535_374337:309-nf] For there the death on behalf of the world is one, and one the resurrection of the dead, whereof baptism is a type. For this cause the Lord, who is the Dispenser of our life, gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a type of life and death, for the water fulfils the image of death, and the Spirit gives us the earnest of life. Hence it follows that the answer to our question why the water was associated with the Spirit[fn-15-P1536_374781:310-nf] is clear: the reason is because in baptism two ends were proposed; on the one hand, the destroying of the body of sin,[fn-15-P1537_374927:311-nf] that it may never bear fruit unto death;[fn-15-P1538_374991:312-nf] on the other hand, our living unto the Spirit,[fn-15-P1539_375062:313-nf] and having our fruit in holiness;[fn-15-P1540_375119:314-nf] the water receiving the body as in a tomb figures death, while the Spirit pours in the quickening power, renewing our souls from the deadness of sin unto their original life. This then is what it is to be born again of water and of the Spirit, the being made dead being effected in the water, while our life is wrought in us through the Spirit. In three immersions,[fn-15-P1541_375509:315-nf] then, and with three invocations, the great mystery of baptism is performed, to the end that the type of death may be fully figured, and that by the tradition of the divine knowledge the baptized may have their souls enlightened. It follows that if there is any grace in the water, it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence of the Spirit. For baptism is \"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God.\"[fn-15-P1542_376000:316-nf] So in training us for the life that follows on the resurrection the Lord sets out all the manner of life required by the Gospel, laying down for us the law of gentleness, of endurance of wrong, of freedom from the defilement that comes of the love of pleasure, and from covetousness, to the end that we may of set purpose win beforehand and achieve all that the life to come of its inherent nature possesses. If therefore any one in attempting a definition were to describe the gospel as a forecast of the life that follows on the resurrection, he would not seem to me to go beyond what is meet and right.

But in no way is the \"mouth\" a member, nor the Spirit breath that is dissolved; but the word \"mouth\" is used so far as it can be appropriate to God, and the Spirit is a Substance having life, gifted with supreme power of sanctification. Thus the dose relation is made plain, while the mode of the ineffable existence is safeguarded. He is moreover styled `Spirit of Christ,' as being by nature closely related to Him.

L. Pray, have you not read what is said concerning the bishops,[fn-58-P5828_1696310:8-nf] \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of man.\" And then there is the fact that the priest[fn-58-P5829_1696555:9-nf] intercedes with God for the sinful people, while there is no one to entreat for the priest. Now these two passages of Scripture tend to the same conclusion. For as salt seasons all food and nothing is so pleasant as to please the palate without it: so the bishop is the seasoning of the whole world and of his own Church, and if he lose his savour through the denial of truth, or through heresy, or lust, or, to comprehend all in one word, through sin of any kind, by what other can he be seasoned, when he was the seasoning of all? The priest, we know, offers his oblation for the layman, lays his hand upon him when submissive, invokes the return of the Holy Spirit, and thus, after inviting the prayers of the people, reconciles to the altar him who had been delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit might he saved; nor does the restore one member to health until all the members have wept together with him. For a father easily pardons his son, when the mother entreats for her offspring. If then it is by the priestly order that a penitent layman is restored to the Church, and pardon follows where sorrow has gone before, it is clear that a priest who has been removed from his order cannot be restored to the place he has forfeited, because either he will be a penitent and then he cannot be a priest, or if he continues to hold office he cannot be brought back to the Church by penitential discipline. Will you dare to spoil the savour of the Church with the salt which has lost its savour? Will you replace at the altar the man who having been cast out ought to lie in the mire and be trodden under foot by all men? What then will become of the Apostle's command,[fn-58-P5830_1698271:10-nf] \"The bishop must be blameless as God's steward\"?

But if you understand the words as a general admonition, how much mere must care be exercised in the case of priests when so much precaution is taken where the laity are concerned?[fn-58-P5833_1698703:13-nf] \"Depart, I pray you,\" says the Lord by Moses, \"from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.\" And again in the Minor Prophets,[fn-58-P5834_1698909:14-nf] \"Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted.\" And in the Gospel the Lord says,[fn-58-P5835_1699063:15-nf] \"The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.\" For when the bishop preaches the true faith the darkness is scattered from the hearts of all. And he gives the reason,[fn-58-P5836_1699310:16-nf] \"Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.\" That is, God's motive for lighting the fire of His knowledge in the bishop is that he may not shine for himself only, but for the common benefit. And in the next sentence[fn-58-P5837_1699624:17-nf] \"If,\" says he, \"thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness!\" And rightly; for since the bishop is appointed in the Church that he may restrain the people from error, how great will the error of the people be when he himself who teaches errs. How can he remit sins, who is himself a sinner? How can an impious man make a man holy? How shall the light enter into me, when my eye is blind? O misery! Antichrist's disciple governs the Church of Christ. And what are we to think of the words,[fn-58-P5838_1700230:18-nf] \"No man can serve two masters\"? And that too[fn-58-P5839_1700297:19-nf] \"What communion hath light and darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial?\" In the old testament we read,[fn-58-P5840_1700446:20-nf] \"No man that hath a blemish shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord.\" And again,[fn-58-P5841_1700559:21-nf] \"Let the priests who come nigh to the Lord their God be clean, lest haply the Lord forsake them.\" And in the same place,[fn-58-P5842_1700779:22-nf] \"And when they draw nigh to minister in holy things, let them not bring sin upon themselves, lest they die.\" And there are many other passages which it would be an endless task to detail, and which I omit for the sake of brevity.

For it was not that gods might make, or make after the image and likeness of gods; but that the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit might make after the image of the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, that man might subsist as the image of God. And God is the Trinity. But because that image of God was not made altogether equal to Him, as being not born of Him, but created by Him; in order to signify this, he is in such way the image as that he is \"after the image,\" that is, he is not made equal by parity, but approaches to Him by a sort of likeness. For approach to God is not by intervals of place, but by likeness, and withdrawal from Him is by unlikeness. For there are some who draw this distinction, that they will have the Son to be the image, but man not to be the image, but \"after the image.\" But the apostle refutes them, saying, \"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.\"[fn-12-P1222_531869:30-nf] He did not say after the image, but the image. And this image, since it is elsewhere spoken of as after the image, is not as if it were said relatively to the Son, who is the image equal to the Father; otherwise he would not say after our image. For how our, when the Son is the image of the Father alone? But man is said to be \"after the image,\" on account, as we have said, of the inequality of the likeness; and therefore after our image, that man might be the image of the Trinity;[fn-12-P1223_532374:31-nf] not equal to the Trinity as the Son is equal to the Father, but approaching to it, as has been said, by a certain likeness; just as nearness may in a sense be signified in things distant from each other, not in respect of place, but of a sort of imitation. For it is also said, \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind;\"[fn-12-P1224_533193:32-nf] to whom he likewise says, \"Be ye therefore imitators of God as dear children.\"[fn-12-P1225_533290:33-nf] For it is said to the new man, \"which is renewed to the knowledge of God, after the image of Him that created him.\"[fn-12-P1226_533422:34-nf] Or if we choose to admit the plural number, in order to meet the needs of argument, even putting aside relative terms, that so we may answer in one term when it is asked what three, and say three substances or three persons; then let no one think of any bulk or interval, or of any distance of howsoever little unlikeness, so that in the Trinity any should be understood to be even a little less than another, in whatsoever way one thing can be less than another: in order that there may be neither a confusion of persons, nor such a distinction as that there should be any inequality. And if this cannot be grasped by the understanding, let it be held by faith, until He shall dawn in the heart who says by the prophet, \"If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not understand.\"[fn-12-P1227_534220:35-nf] ","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And so they upbraid the discipline of monogamy with being a heresy; nor is there any other cause whence they find themselves compelled to deny the Paraclete more than the fact that they esteem Him to be the institutor of a novel discipline, and a discipline which they find most harsh: so that this is already the first ground on which we must join issue in a general handling (of the subject), whether there is room for maintaining that the Paraclete has taught any such thing as can either be charged with novelty, in opposition to catholic tradition,[fn-10-P1082_275056:5-nf] or with burdensomeness, in opposition to the \"light burden\"[fn-10-P1083_275207:6-nf] of the Lord.","title":"VI.

You raise the objection that all Israelites had the same measure of manna, an homer, and were alike in respect of dress, and hair, and beard, and shoes; as though we did not all alike partake of the body of Christ. In the Christian mysteries there is one means of sanctification for the master and the servant, the noble and the low-born, for the king and his soldiers, and yet, that which is one varies according to the merits of those who receive it.[fn-68-P6843_2175187:224-nf] \"Whosoever shall eat or drink unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.\" Does it follow that because Judas drank of the same cup as the rest of the apostles, that he and they are of equal merit? But suppose that we do not choose to receive the sacrament, at all events we all have the same life, breathe the same air, have the same blood in our veins, are fed on the same food. Moreover, if our viands are improved by culinary skill and are made more palatable for the consumer, food of this kind does not satisfy nature, but tickles the appetite. We are all alike subject to hunger, all alike suffer with cold: we alike are shrivelled with the frost, or melted with the broiling heat. The sun and the moon, and all the company of the stars, the showers, the whole world run their course for us all alike, and, as the Gospel tells us, the same refreshing rain falls upon all, good and bad, just and unjust. If the present is a picture of the future, then the Sun of Righteousness will rise upon sinners as well as upon the righteous, upon the wicked and the holy, upon the heathen as well as upon Jews and Christians, though the Scripture says,[fn-68-P6844_2176374:225-nf] \"Unto you that fear the Lord shall the Sun of Righteousness arise.\" If He will rise to those that fear, He will set to the despisers and the false prophets. The sheep which stand on the right hand will be brought into the kingdom of heaven, the goats will be thrust down to hell. The parable does not contrast the sheep one with another, or on the other hand the goats, but merely makes a difference between sheep and goats. The whole truth is not taught in a single passage: we must always bear in mind the exact point of an illustration. For instance, the ten virgins are not examples of the whole human race, but of the careful and the slothful: the former are ever anticipating the advent of our Lord, the latter abandon themselves to idle slumber without a thought of future judgment. And so at the end of the parable it is said,[fn-68-P6845_2177228:226-nf] \"Watch, for ye know not the day, nor the hour.\" If at the deluge Noah was delivered, and the whole world perished, all men were flesh, and therefore were destroyed. You must either say that the sons of Noah and Noah for whose sake they were delivered were of unequal merit, or you must place the accursed Ham in the same rank as his father because he was delivered with him from the flood. At the passion of Christ all wavered, all were unprofitable together: there was none that did good, no not one. Will you therefore dare to say that Peter and the rest of the Apostles who fled denied the Saviour in the same sense as Caiaphas and the Pharisees and the people who cried out,[fn-68-P6846_2177933:227-nf] \"Crucify him, crucify him\"? And, to say no more about the Apostles, do you think Annas add Caiaphas, and Judas the traitor guilty of no greater crime than Pilate who was compelled against his will to give sentence against our Lord? The guilt of Judas is proportioned to his former merit, and the greater the guilt, the greater the penalty too.[fn-68-P6847_2178300:228-nf] \"For the mighty shall mightily suffer torment.\" An evil tree does not bear good fruit, nor a good tree evil fruit. If this be so, tell me how it was that Paul though he was an evil tree and persecuted the Church of Christ, afterwards bore good fruit? And Judas, though he was a good tree and wrought miracles like the other Apostles, afterwards turned traitor and brought forth evil fruit? The truth is that a good tree does not bear evil fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit, so long as they continue in their goodness, or badness.

If the woman fills up the image of the trinity after the measure of her own person, why is the man still called that image after she has been taken out of his side? Or if even one person of a human being out of three can be called the image of God, as each person also is God in the supreme Trinity itself, why is the woman also not the image of God?

But we must notice how that which the apostle says, that not the woman but the man is the image of God, is not contrary to that which is written in Genesis, \"God created man: in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them: and He blessed them.\" For this text says that human nature itself, which is complete [only] in both sexes, was made in the image of God; and it does not separate the woman from the image of God which it signifies. For after saying that God made man in the image of God, \"He created him,\" it says, \"male and female:\" or at any rate, punctuating the words otherwise, \"male and female created He them.\" How then did the apostle tell us that the man is the image of God, and therefore he is forbidden to cover his head; but that the woman is not so, and therefore is commanded to cover hers? Unless, forsooth, according to that which I have said already, when I was treating of the nature of the human mind, that the woman together with her own husband is the image of God, so that that whole substance may be one image; but when she is referred separately to her quality of help-meet, which regards the woman herself alone, then she is not the image of God; but as regards the man alone, he is the image of God as fully and completely as when the woman too is joined with him in one. As we said of the nature of the human mind, that both in the case when as a whole it contemplates the truth it is the image of God; and in the case when anything is divided from it, and diverted in order to the cognition of temporal things; nevertheless on that side on which it beholds and consults truth, here also it is the image of God, but on that side whereby it is directed to the cognition of the lower things, it is not the image of God. And since it is so much the more formed after the image of God, the more it has extended itself to that which is eternal, and is on that account not to be restrained, so as to withhold and refrain itself from thence; therefore the man ought not to cover his head. But because too great a progression towards inferior things is dangerous to that rational cognition that is conversant with things corporeal and temporal; this ought to have power on its head, which the covering indicates, by which it is signified that it ought to be restrained. For a holy and pious meaning is pleasing to the holy angels.[fn-15-P1536_754906:14-nf] For God sees not after the way of time, neither does anything new take place in His vision and knowledge, when anything is done in time and transitorily, after the way in which such things affect the senses, whether the carnal senses of animals and men, or even the heavenly senses of the angels.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_18_book_xii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"20.

And according to this distribution, by which the man is assumed to be the mind, but the woman the bodily sense, all things seem aptly to agree together if they are handled with due attention: unless that it is written, that in all the beasts and flying things there was not found for man an helpmate like to himself; and then the woman was made out of his side[fn-15-P1581_772968:37-nf] And on this account I, for my part, have not thought that the bodily sense should be taken for the woman, which we see to be common to ourselves and to the beasts; but I have desired to find something which the beasts had not; and I have rather thought the bodily sense should be understood to be the serpent, whom we read to have been more subtle than all beasts of the field.[fn-15-P1582_773367:38-nf] For in those natural good things which we see are common to ourselves and to the irrational animals, the sense excels by a kind of living power; not the sense of which it is written in the epistle addressed to the Hebrews, where we read, that \"strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil;\"[fn-15-P1583_773774:39-nf] for these \"senses\" belong to the rational nature and pertain to the understanding; but that sense which is divided into five parts in the body, through which corporeal species and motion is perceived not only by ourselves, but also by the beasts.21.

They are the faculties of seeing, and hearing, and smelling, and tasting, and touching. The fidelity of these senses is impugned with too much severity by the Platonists,[fn-27-P2737_915262:118-nf] and according to some by Heraclitus also, and Diocles, and Empedocles; at any rate, Plato, in the Timµus, declares the operations of the senses to be irrational, and vitiated[fn-27-P2738_915455:119-nf] by our opinions or beliefs. Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding the certainty that they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure that distant tower with its really quadrangular contour is round; because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric of yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower towards its end; and because it will join with the sea the sky which hangs at so great a height above it. In the same way, our hearing is charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that is a noise in the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if you prefer it[fn-27-P2739_916255:120-nf] the other way, when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a carriage which made the noise. Thus, too, are our faculties of smell and taste at fault, because the selfsame perfumes and wines lose their value after we have used them awhile. On the same principle our touch is censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the hands is felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm water is pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate afterwards. Thus, according to them, our senses deceive us, when all the while we are (the cause of the discrepancies, by) changing our opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; for they do not load with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses, and at all times. The Epicureans, again, show still greater consistency, in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in their testimony, and always so-only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience sensation, they do not exercise opinion; it is the soul that opines. They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation from the soul. Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless the eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no idea that it possessed roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not from the soul? For if the soul had no body, it would have no sensation. Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from sensation; and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be insisted on that there is a something which causes the discrepancy between the report of the senses and the reality of the facts. Now, since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible for phenomena to be reported which are caused not by the senses, but by reasons and conditions which intervene, in the very nature of the case? If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised. The truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming to be inclined or bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in appearance (as well as in fact). The delicacy of the substance or medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as it is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance of the straightness of a right line. In like manner, the condition of the open space which fills up the interval between it and us, necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a similar light obliterates their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards its termination, until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest distance. So the sky blends itself with the sea, the vision becoming spent at last, which had maintained duly the boundaries of the two elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but the similarity of the sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less strong to the smell, and the wine more flat to the taste, and the water not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found in the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the roughness and smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right that limbs like the hands and the feet, so different in tenderness and callousness, should have different impressions. In this way, then, there cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if special causes, (such as we have indicated, ) mislead our senses add (through our senses) our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe the deception to the senses, which follow the specific causes of the illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are afflicted with madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. Orestes in his sister sees his mother; Ajax sees Ulysses in the slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for so vast a fallacy? All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it their taste which you will charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health? All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon, but only in such a way as to be quite free of any fault in their own natural functions. But further still, not even against the specific causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception. For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the reasons do not deserve to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to occur in a certain manner is not a deception. If, then, even these circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said causes exercise a liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to claim for the senses truth, and fidelity, and integrity, seeing that they never render any other account of their impressions than is enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases produce that discrepancy which appears between the report of the senses and the reality of the objects. What mean you, then, O most insolent Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human life; you disturb the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God Himself: for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His works, that we might understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you reproach) as fallacious and treacherous tyrants! But is it not from these that all creation receives our services? Is it not by their means that a second form is impressed even upon the world?-so many arts, so many industrious resources, so many pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies, counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of life! All these things have produced the very relish and savour of human existence; whilst by these senses of man, he alone of all animated nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity for intelligence and knowledge-nay, an ability to form the Academy itself!

Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding the certainty that they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure that distant tower with its really quadrangular contour is round; because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric of yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower towards its end; and because it will join with the sea the sky which hangs at so great a height above it. In the same way, our hearing is charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that is a noise in the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if you prefer it[fn-27-P2739_916255:120-nf] the other way, when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a carriage which made the noise. Thus, too, are our faculties of smell and taste at fault, because the selfsame perfumes and wines lose their value after we have used them awhile. On the same principle our touch is censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the hands is felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm water is pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate afterwards. Thus, according to them, our senses deceive us, when all the while we are (the cause of the discrepancies, by) changing our opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; for they do not load with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses, and at all times. The Epicureans, again, show still greater consistency, in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in their testimony, and always so-only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience sensation, they do not exercise opinion; it is the soul that opines. They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation from the soul. Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless the eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no idea that it possessed roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not from the soul? For if the soul had no body, it would have no sensation. Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from sensation; and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be insisted on that there is a something which causes the discrepancy between the report of the senses and the reality of the facts. Now, since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible for phenomena to be reported which are caused not by the senses, but by reasons and conditions which intervene, in the very nature of the case? If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised. The truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming to be inclined or bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in appearance (as well as in fact). The delicacy of the substance or medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as it is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance of the straightness of a right line. In like manner, the condition of the open space which fills up the interval between it and us, necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a similar light obliterates their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards its termination, until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest distance. So the sky blends itself with the sea, the vision becoming spent at last, which had maintained duly the boundaries of the two elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but the similarity of the sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less strong to the smell, and the wine more flat to the taste, and the water not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found in the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the roughness and smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right that limbs like the hands and the feet, so different in tenderness and callousness, should have different impressions. In this way, then, there cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if special causes, (such as we have indicated, ) mislead our senses add (through our senses) our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe the deception to the senses, which follow the specific causes of the illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are afflicted with madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. Orestes in his sister sees his mother; Ajax sees Ulysses in the slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for so vast a fallacy? All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it their taste which you will charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health? All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon, but only in such a way as to be quite free of any fault in their own natural functions. But further still, not even against the specific causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception. For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the reasons do not deserve to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to occur in a certain manner is not a deception. If, then, even these circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said causes exercise a liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to claim for the senses truth, and fidelity, and integrity, seeing that they never render any other account of their impressions than is enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases produce that discrepancy which appears between the report of the senses and the reality of the objects. What mean you, then, O most insolent Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human life; you disturb the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God Himself: for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His works, that we might understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you reproach) as fallacious and treacherous tyrants! But is it not from these that all creation receives our services? Is it not by their means that a second form is impressed even upon the world?-so many arts, so many industrious resources, so many pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies, counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of life! All these things have produced the very relish and savour of human existence; whilst by these senses of man, he alone of all animated nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity for intelligence and knowledge-nay, an ability to form the Academy itself!

We have endeavored, then, so to do; in order that we might see in some ;way or other by this image which we are, Him by whom we are made, as by a glass. And this is intimated also in the words of the same apostle: \"But we with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\"[fn-19-P1955_984406:27-nf] \"Beholding as in a glass,\"[fn-19-P1956_984454:28-nf] he has said, i.e. seeing by means of a glass, not looking from a watch-tower: an ambiguity that does not exist in the Greek language, whence the apostolic epistles have been rendered into Latin. For in Greek, a glass,[fn-19-P1957_984690:29-nf] in which the images of things are visible, is wholly distinct in the sound of the word also from a watch-tower,[fn-19-P1958_984817:30-nf] from the height of which we command a more distant view. And it is quite plain that the apostle, in using the word \"speculantes\" in respect to the glory of the Lord, meant it to come from \"speculum,\" not from \"specula.\" But where he says, \"We are transformed into the same image,\" he assuredly means to speak of the image of God; and by calling it \"the same,\" he means that very image which we see in the glass, because that same image is also the glory of the Lord; as he says elsewhere, \"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God,\"[fn-19-P1959_985415:31-nf] -a text already discussed in the twelfth book. He means, then, by \"We are transformed,\" that we are changed from one form to another, and that we pass from a form that is obscure to a form that is bright: since the obscure form, too, is the image of God; and if an image, then assuredly also \"glory,\" in which we are created as men, being better than the other animals. For it is said of human nature in itself, \"The man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God.\" And this nature, being the most excellent among things created, is transformed from a form that is defaced into a form that is beautiful, when it is justified by its own Creator from ungodliness.

Afterwards, it is true, Marcion professed repentance, and agreed to the conditions granted to him-that he should receive reconciliation if he restored to the church all the others whom he had been training for perdition: he was prevented, however, by death. It was indeed[fn-35-P3529_1205589:310-nf] necessary that there should be heresies;[fn-35-P3530_1205662:311-nf] and yet it does not follow from that necessity, that heresies are a good thing.

Returning therefrom, after some years, unimproved, except that he was no longer a Marcionite, he clave[fn-35-P3535_1206569:316-nf] to another woman, the maiden Philumene (whom we have already[fn-35-P3536_1206646:317-nf] mentioned), who herself afterwards became an enormous prostitute.

For we both honor the passion of Christ as accomplished for us, and we hate the crime of the Jews who crucified Him. The garment signifies the sacrament, their backs the memory of things past: for the church celebrates the passion of Christ as already accomplished, and no longer to be looked forward to, now that Japheth already dwells in the habitations of Shem, and their wicked brother between them.","title":"Book XVI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_16_lecture_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"14.

But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.\"[fn-25-P2514_1204341:127-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_23_book_ii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"These things, then, being as I have stated them, it is now evident that there has arisen a deadly heresy, which, with the Lord's help, the Church by this time guards against more directly-now that those two men, Pelagius and Coelestius, have been either offered repentance, or on their refusal been wholly condemned. They are reported, or perhaps actually proved, to be the authors of this perversion; at all events, if not the authors (as having learnt it from others), they are yet its boasted abettors and teachers, through whose agency the heresy has advanced and grown to a wider extent. This boast, too, is made even in their own statements and writings, and in unmistakeable signs of reality, as well as in the fame which arises and grows out of all these circumstances. What, therefore, remains to be done? Must not every catholic, with all the energies wherewith the Lord endows him, confute this pestilential doctrine, and oppose it with all vigilance; so that whenever we contend for the truth, compelled to answer, but not fond of the contest, the untaught may be instructed, and that thus the Church may be benefited by that which the enemy devised for her destruction; in accordance with that word of the apostle's, \"There must be heresies, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you\"?[fn-36-P3615_1388029:26-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_23_book_ii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"By disputation of this sort, they attempt to exclude the ancient saints from the grace of the Mediator, as if the man Christ Jesus were not the Mediator between God and those men; on the ground that, not having yet taken flesh of the Virgin's womb, He was not yet man at the time when those righteous men lived. If this, however, were true, in vain would the apostle say: \"By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\"[fn-36-P3666_1402584:59-nf] For inasmuch as those ancient saints, according to the vain conceits of these men, found their nature self-sufficient, and required not the man Christ to be their Mediator to reconcile them to God, so neither shall they be made alive in Him, to whose body they are shown not to belong as members, according to the statement that it was on man's account that He became man. If, however, as the Truth says through His apostles, even as all die in Adam, even so shall all be made alive in Christ; forasmuch as the resurrection of the dead comes through the one man, even as death comes through the other man; what Christian man can be bold enough to doubt that even those righteous men who pleased God in the more remote periods of the human race are destined to attain to the resurrection of eternal life, and not eternal death, because they shall be made alive in Christ? that they are made alive in Christ, because they belong to the body of Christ? that they belong to the body of Christ, because Christ is the head even to them?[fn-36-P3667_1403639:60-nf] and that Christ is the head even to them, because there is but one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus? But this He could not have been to them, unless through His grace they had believed in His resurrection. And how could they have done this, if they had been ignorant that He was to come in the flesh, and if they had not by this faith lived justly and piously? Now, if the incarnation of Christ could be of no concern to them, on the ground that it had not yet come about, it must follow that Christ's judgment can be of no concern to us, because it has not yet taken place. But if we shall stand at the right hand of Christ through our faith in His judgment, which has not yet transpired, but is to come to pass, it follows that those ancient saints are members of Christ through their faith in His resurrection, which had not in their day happened, but which was one day to come to pass.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"23.

As regards the passage from Paul's epistle which teaches, in opposition to your heresy, that the Son of God was born of the seed of David, it is found in all manuscripts both new and old of all Churches, and in all languages. So the profession which Faustus makes of believing the apostle is hypocritical. Instead of saying, \"Assuredly I believe,\" he should have said, Assuredly I do not believe, as he would have said if he had not wished to deceive people. What part of his belief does he get from the apostle? Not the first man, of whom the apostle says that he is of the earth, earthy; and again, \"The first man Adam was made a living soul.\" Faustus' First Man is neither of the earth, earthy, nor made a living soul, but of the substance of God, and the same in essence as God; and this being is said to have mixed up with the race of darkness his members, or vesture, or weapons, that is, the five elements, which also are part of the substance of God, so that they became subject to confinement and pollution. Nor does Faustus get from Paul his Second Man, of whom Paul says that He is from heaven, and that He is the last Adam, and a quickening spirit; and also that He was born of the seed of David after the flesh, that He was made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law.[fn-13-P1343_712133:5-nf] Of Him Paul says to Timothy: \"Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead, according to my gospel.\"[fn-13-P1344_712282:6-nf] And this resurrection he quotes as an example of our resurrection: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures.\" And a little further on he draws an inference from this doctrine: \"Now, if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?\"[fn-13-P1345_712774:7-nf] Our professed believer in Paul believes nothing of all this. He denies that Jesus was born of the seed of David, that He was made of a woman (by the word woman is not meant a wife in the common sense of the word, but merely one of the female sex, as in the book of Genesis, where it is said that God made a woman before she was brought to Adam[fn-13-P1346_713142:8-nf] ); he denies His death, His burial, and His resurrection. He holds that Christ had not a mortal body, and therefore could not really die; and that the marks of His wounds which He showed to His disciples when He appeared to them alive after His resurrection, which Paul also mentions,[fn-13-P1347_713443:9-nf] were not real. He denies, too, that our mortal body will be raised again, changed into a spiritual body; as Paul teaches: \"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\" To illustrate this distinction between the natural and the spiritual body, the apostle adds what I have quoted already about the first and the last Adam. Then he goes on: \"But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\" And to explain what he means by flesh and blood, that it is not the bodily substance, but corruption, which will not enter into the resurrection of the just, he immediately says, \"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" And in case any one should still suppose that it is not what is buried that is to rise again, but that it is as if one garment were laid aside and a better taken instead, he proceeds to show distinctly that the same body will be changed for the better, as the garments of Christ on the mount were not displaced, but transfigured: \"Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all be changed, but we shall all rise.\"[fn-13-P1348_714540:10-nf] Then he shows who are to be changed: \"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\" And if it should be said that it is not as regards our mortal and corruptible body, but as regards our soul, that we are to be changed, it should be observed that the apostle is not speaking of the soul, but of the body, as is evident from the question he starts with: \"But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?\" So also, in the conclusion of his argument, he leaves no doubt of what he is speaking: \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-13-P1349_715270:11-nf] Faustus denies this; and the God whom Paul declares to be \"immortal, incorruptible, to whom alone is glory and honor,\"[fn-13-P1350_715412:12-nf] he makes corruptible. For in this monstrous and horrible fiction of theirs, the substance and nature of God was in danger of being wholly corrupted by the race of darkness, and to save the rest part actually was corrupted. And to crown all this, he tries to deceive the ignorant who are not learned in the sacred Scriptures, by making this profession: I assuredly believe the Apostle Paul; when he ought to have said, I assuredly do not believe.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_19_lecture_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"10.

Again, every one must be impressed, and be either enlightened or confirmed in the faith, by the blessing of the two sons who honored the nakedness of their father, though they turned away their faces, as displeased with the evil done by the vine. \"Blessed,\" he says, \"be the Lord God of Shem.\" For although God is the God of all nations, even the Gentiles acknowledge Him to be in a peculiar sense the God of Israel. And how is this to be explained but by the blessing of Japhet? The occupation of all the world by the Church among the Gentiles was exactly foretold in the words: \"Let God enlarge Japhet, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem.\" That is for the Manichaean to attend to. You see what the state of the world actually is. The very thing that you are astonished and grieved at in us is this, that God is enlarging Japhet. Is He not dwelling in the tents of Shem?-that is, in the churches built by the apostles, the sons of the prophets. Hear what Paul says to the believing Gentiles: \"Ye were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants; having no hope of the promise, and without God in the world.\" In these words there is a description of the state of Japhet before he dwelt in the tents of Shem. But observe what follows: \"Now then;\" he says, \"ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone.\"[fn-14-P1443_774064:42-nf] Here we have Japhet enlarged, and dwelling in tile tents of Shem. These testimonies are taken from the epistles of the apostles, which you yourselves acknowledge, and read, and profess to follow. You occupy an unhappy middle position in a building of which Christ is not the chief corner-stone. For you do not belong to the wall of those who, like the apostles, being of the circumcision, believed in Christ; nor to the wall of those who, being of the uncircumcision, like all the Gentiles, are joined in the unity of faith, as in the fellowship of the corner-stone. However, all who accept and read any books of our canon in which Christ is spoken of as having been born and having suffered in the flesh, and who do not unite with us in a common veiling with the sacrament of the mortality, uncovered by the passion, but without the knowledge of piety and charity make known that from which we all are born, -although they differ among themselves, whether as Jews and heretics, or as heretics of one kind or other,-are still all useful to the Church, as being all alike servants, either in bearing witness to or in proving some truth. For of heretics it is said: \"There must be heresies, that those who are approved among you may be manifested.\"[fn-14-P1444_775337:43-nf] Go on, then, with your objections to the Old Testament Scriptures! Go on, ye servants of Ham! You have despised the flesh from which you were born when uncovered. For you could not have called yourselves Christians unless Christ had come into the world, as foretold by the prophets, and had drunk of His own vine that cup which could not pass from Him, and had slept in His passion, as in the drunkenness of the folly which is wiser than men; and so, in the hidden counsel of God, the disclosure had been made of that infirmity of mortal flesh which is stronger than men. For unless the Word of God had taken on Himself this infirmity, the name of Christian, in which you also glory, would not exist in the earth. Go on, then, as I have said. Declare in mockery what we may honor with reverence. Let the Church use you as her servants to make manifest those members who are approved. So particular are the predictions of the prophets regarding the state and the sufferings of the Church, that we can find a place even for you in what is said of the destructive error by which the reprobate are to perish, while the approved are to be manifested.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_22_book_iv_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"When those who maintained the Nicene doctrines demanded of the Acacians how they could say that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, and that He proceeded out of nothing, when it was affirmed in their own formulary that He is \"God of God,\" they replied that the Apostle Paul had declared that \"All things are of God,\"[fn-37-P3733_1640459:75-nf] and that the Son is included in the term \"all things\"; and that it was in this sense, and in accordance with the Sacred Scriptures, that the expressions in their formulary were to be understood.

With respect to the Holy Spirit, however, there has not been as yet, on the part of learned and distinguished investigators of the Scriptures, a discussion of the subject full enough or careful enough to make it possible for us to obtain an intelligent conception of what also constitutes His special individuality (proprium): in virtue of which special individuality it comes to be the case that we cannot call Him either the Son or the Father, but only the Holy Spirit; excepting that they predicate Him to be the Gift of God, so that we may believe God not to give a gift inferior to Himself. At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without beginning (ne duo constituamus principia isne principio), which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain heretics.[fn-32-P3275_1506357:92-nf] Some, however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead (deitatem), which the Greeks designate qeotha, is the Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each other,-to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by cleaving to the Father,[fn-32-P3276_1506799:93-nf] -should [thereby] be constituted equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other, they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which says, \"For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,\"[fn-32-P3277_1507383:94-nf] or many other proofs texts of a similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the express fact that it is through the Holy Spirit that we are reconciled unto God; whence also, when He is called the Gift of God, they will have it that sufficient indication is offered of the love of God and the Holy Spirit being identical. For we are not reconciled unto Him except through that love in virtue of which we are also called sons:[fn-32-P3278_1507839:95-nf] as we are no more \"under fear, like servants,\"[fn-32-P3279_1507954:96-nf] because \"love, when it is made perfect, casteth out fear;\"[fn-32-P3280_1508033:97-nf] and [as] \"we have received the spirit of liberty, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-32-P3281_1508134:98-nf] And inasmuch as, being reconciled and called back into friendship through love, we shall be able to become acquainted with all the secret things of God, for this reason it is said of the Holy Spirit that \"He shall lead you into all truth.\"[fn-32-P3282_1508394:99-nf] For the same reason also, that confidence in preaching the truth, with which the apostles were filled at His advent,[fn-32-P3283_1508531:100-nf] is rightly ascribed to love; because diffidence also is assigned to fear, which the perfecting of love excludes. Thus, likewise, the same is called the Gift of God,[fn-32-P3284_1508715:101-nf] because no one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to the same in love (ei dilectione cohaerere). Neither does any one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (Spiritus Sanctus), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned (sanciuntur)[fn-32-P3285_1509135:102-nf] are sanctioned with a view to their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity (sanctitatem) is derived from sanction (a sanciendo). Above all, however, that testimony is employed by the upholders of this opinion, where it is thus written, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;\"[fn-32-P3286_1509634:103-nf] \"for God is a Spirit.\"[fn-32-P3287_1509677:104-nf] For here He speaks of our regeneration,[fn-32-P3288_1509737:105-nf] which is not, according to Adam, of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit, when it is said, \"For God is a Spirit,\" they maintain that we must take note that it is not said, \"for the Spirit is God,\"[fn-32-P3289_1510223:106-nf] but, \"for God is a Spirit;\" so that the very Godhead of the Father and the Son is in this passage called God, and that is the Holy Spirit. To this is added another testimony which the Apostle John offers, when he says, \"For God is love.\"[fn-32-P3290_1510571:107-nf] For here, in like manner, what he says is not, \"Love is God,\"[fn-32-P3291_1510655:108-nf] but, \"God is love;\" so that the very Godhead is taken to be love. And with respect to the circumstance that, in that enumeration of mutually connected objects which is given when it is said, \"All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's,\"[fn-32-P3292_1511009:109-nf] as also, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God,\"[fn-32-P3293_1511143:110-nf] there is no mention of the Holy Spirit; this they affirm to be but an application of the principle that, in general, the connection itself is not wont to be enumerated among the things which are connected with each other. Whence, also, those who read with closer attention appear to recognize the express Trinity likewise in that passage in which it is said, \"For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things.\"[fn-32-P3294_1511582:111-nf] \"Of Him,\" as if it meant, of that One who owes it to no one that He is: \"through Him,\" as if the idea were, through a Mediator; \"in Him,\" as if it were, in that One who holds together, that is, unites by connecting.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_27_book_i_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now, if to the God of our fathers, who is likewise our God, such a plurality of wives had not been displeasing for the purpose that lust might have a fuller range of indulgence; then, on such a supposition, the holy women also ought each to have rendered service to several husbands. But if any woman had so acted, what feeling but that of a disgraceful concupiscence could impel her to have more husbands, seeing that by such licence she could not have more children? That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair, which was made by the Divine Being Himself, with the intention of marriages taking their beginning therefrom, and of its affording to them a more honourable precedent. In the advance, however, of the human race, it came to pass that to certain good men were united a plurality of good wives,-many to each; and from this it would seem that moderation sought rather unity on one side for dignity, while nature permitted plurality on the other side for fecundity. For on natural principles it is more feasible for one to have dominion over many, than for many to have dominion over one. Nor can it be doubted, that it is more consonant with the order of nature that men should bear rule over women, than women over men. It is with this principle in view that the apostle says, \"The head of the woman is the man;\"[fn-38-P3881_1472966:28-nf] and, \"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.\"[fn-38-P3882_1473041:29-nf] So also the Apostle Peter writes: \"Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.\"[fn-38-P3883_1473144:30-nf] Now, although the fact of the matter is, that while nature loves singleness in her dominations, but we may see plurality existing more readily in the subordinate portion of our race; yet for all that, it was at no time lawful for one man to have a plurality of wives, except for the purpose of a greater number of children springing from him.

But then after saying, \"That they also may be one in us,\" He added, \"That the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" What does He mean by this? Is it that the world will then be brought to the faith, when we shall all be one in the Father and Son? Is not such a state the everlasting peace, and the reward of faith, rather than faith itself?

What, then, is meant by the words, \"That they all may be one, that the world may believe\"? This, doubtless, that the \"all\" are themselves the believing world. For those who shall be one are not of one class, and the world that is thereafter to believe on this very ground that these shall be one, of another; since it is perfectly certain that He says, \"That they all may be one,\" of those of whom He had said before, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on me through their word,\" immediately adding as He does, \"That they all may be one.\" And this \"all,\" what is it but the world; not certainly that which is hostile, but that which is believing? For you see here that He who had said, \"I pray not for the world,\" now prayeth for the world that it may believe. For there is a world whereof it is written, \"That we might not be condemned with this world.\"[fn-35-P3541_1962170:3-nf] For that world He prayeth not, for He is fully aware to what it is predestinated. And there is a world whereof it is written, \"For the Son of man came not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved ;\"[fn-35-P3542_1962414:4-nf] and hence the apostle also says, \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.\"[fn-35-P3543_1962522:5-nf] For this world it is that He prayeth, in saying, \"That the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" For through this faith the world is reconciled unto God when it believes in the Christ whom God has sent. How, then, are we to understand Him when He says, \"That they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me,\" but just in this way, that He did not assign the cause of the world believing to the fact that those others are one, as if it believed on the ground that it saw them to be one; for the world itself here consisteth of all who by their own believing become one; but in His prayer He said, \"That the world may believe,\" just as in His prayer He also said, \"That they all may be one;\" and still further in the same prayer, \"That they also may be one in us.\" For the words, \"they all may be one,\" are equivalent to \"the world may believe,\" since it is by believing that they become one, perfectly one; that is, those who, although one by nature, had ceased to be so by their mutual dissensions. In fine, if the verb which He uses, \"I pray,\" be understood in the third clause, or rather, to make the whole fuller, be everywhere supplied, the explanation of this sentence will be all the clearer: I pray \"that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, in me, and I in Thee ;\" I pray \"that they also may be one in us ;\" I pray \"that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" And, mark, He added the words \"in us\" in order that we may know that our being made one in that love of unchanging faithfulness is to be attributed to the grace of God, and not to ourselves: just as the apostle, after saying, \"For ye were at one time darkness, but now are ye light,\" that none might attribute the doing of this to themselves, added, \"in the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3544_1964316:6-nf] ","title":"Tractate CX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"2","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The first part of my contentions against Eunomius has with God's help been sufficiently established in the preceding work, as all who will may see from what I have worked out, how in that former part his fallacy has been completely exposed, and its falsehood has no further force against the truth, except in the case of those who show a very shameless animus against her.

Since then, that shepherd who is in the record, when he had cast down the alien with his sling, and broken his helmet with the stone, so that it gaped under the violence of the blow, did not confine his valour to gazing on his fallen foe, but running in upon him, and depriving him of his head, returns bearing it as a trophy to his people, parading that braggart head through the host of his countrymen; looking to this example it becomes us also to advance nothing daunted to the second part of our labours, but as far as possible to imitate David's valour, and, like him, after the first blow to plant our foot upon the fallen foe, so that enemy of the truth may be exhibited as much as possible as a headless trunk.

For since Christ is the head of every man, as saith the Apostle[fn-21-P2162_1316972:3-nf] , and it is only reasonable that the believer alone should be so termed (for Christ, I take it, cannot be the head of the unbelieving also), it follows that he who is severed from the saving faith must be headless like Goliath, being severed from the true head by his own sword which he had whetted against the truth; which head it shall be our task not to cut off, but to show that it is cut off.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":11,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"24. If what we have made mention of out of the Apostolic Epistles seem to you to fall short of an answer, hear yet others, if ye have ears. What saith the utterly mad Manichaean of the Flesh of Christ?

How was there in Christ no evil, in Whom was so great a lie? Because forsooth to men over-clean true flesh is an evil, and false flesh instead of true is not an evil: it is an evil, true flesh of one born of the seed of David, and it is no evil,false tongue of one saying, \"Handle, and see, that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me to have.\" Of the Church what saith the deceiver of men with deadly error? That on the side of souls it pertains unto Christ, on the side of bodies unto the devil? What to this saith the Teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth? \"Know ye not,\" saith he, \"that your bodies are members of Christ?\"[fn-36-P3683_1739634:86-nf] Of the sex of male and female what saith the son of perdition? That either sex is not of God, but of the devil. What to this saith the Vessel of Election? \"As,\" saith he, \"the woman from out the man, so also the man through the woman: but all things of God.\"[fn-36-P3684_1739913:87-nf] Of the flesh what saith the unclean spirit through the Manichaean? That it is an evil substance, and not the creation of God, but of an enemy. What to this saith the Holy Spirit through Paul? \"For as the body is one,\" saith he, \"and hath many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.\"[fn-36-P3685_1740264:88-nf] And a little after; \"God hath set,\" saith he, \"the members, each one of them in the body, as He willed.\"[fn-36-P3686_1740390:89-nf] Also a little after; \"God,\" saith he, \"hath tempered the body, giving greater honor unto that to which it was wanting, that there should be no schisms in the body, but that the members have the self-same care one for another: and whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it: or one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with it.\"[fn-36-P3687_1740762:90-nf] How is the flesh evil, when the souls themselves are admonished to imitate the peace of its members? How is it the creation of the enemy, when the souls themselves, which rule the bodies, take pattern from the members of the body, not to have schisms of enmities among themselves, in order that, what God hath granted unto the body by nature, this themselves also may love to have by grace?

But, say they, how is the flesh by a certain likeness compared unto the Church? What! doth the Church lust against Christ? whereas the same Apostle said, \"The Church is subject unto Christ.\"[fn-36-P3690_1741741:92-nf] Clearly the Church is subject unto Christ; because the spirit therefore lusteth against the flesh, that on every side the Church may be made subject to Christ; but the flesh lusteth against the spirit, because not as yet hath the Church received that peace which was promised perfect. And for this reason the Church is made subject unto Christ for the pledge of salvation, and the flesh lusteth against the spirit from the weakness of sickness. For neither were those other than members of the Church, unto whom he thus spake, \"Walk in the spirit, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed the one to the other; that ye do not what we would.\"[fn-36-P3691_1742498:93-nf] These things were assuredly spoken unto the Church, which if it were not made subject unto Christ, the spirit would not in it lust against the flesh through continence. By reason of which they were indeed able not to perfect the lusts of the flesh, but through the flesh lusting against the Spirit they were not able to do the things which they would, that is, not even to have the very lusts of the flesh. Lastly, why should we not confess that in spiritual men the Church is subject unto Christ, but in carnal men yet lusteth against Christ? Did not they lust against Christ unto whom it was said, \"Is Christ divided?\"[fn-36-P3692_1743141:94-nf] and, \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. I have given unto yon milk to drink as unto babes in Christ, not meat, for ye were not as yet able; but not even now are ye able: for ye are still carnal. For whereas there is among you emulation, and strife, are ye not carnal?\"[fn-36-P3693_1743461:95-nf] Against whom doth emulation and strife lust, but against Christ? For these lusts of the flesh Christ healeth in His own, but loveth in none. Whence the holy Church, so long as it hath such members, is not yet without spot or wrinkle. To these are added those other sins also, for which the daily cry of the whole Church is, \"Forgive us our debts:\"[fn-36-P3694_1743835:96-nf] and, that we should not think spiritual persons exempt from these, not any one soever of carnal persons, nor any one soever of spiritual persons themselves, but he, who lay on the breast of the Lord,[fn-36-P3695_1744054:97-nf] and whom He loved before others, saith, \"If we shall say that we have not sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-36-P3696_1744204:98-nf] But in every sin, more in what is greater, less in what is less, there is an act of lust against righteousness. And of Christ it is written: \"Who was made unto us by God, Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.\"[fn-36-P3697_1744457:99-nf] In every sin therefore without doubt there is an act of lust against Christ. But when He, Who \"healeth all our sicknesses,\"[fn-36-P3698_1744601:100-nf] a shall have led His Church unto the promised healing of sickness, then in none of its members shall there be any, even the very least spot or wrinkle. Then in no way shall the flesh lust against the spirit, and therefore there shall be no cause why the spirit also lust against the flesh. Then all this conflict shall come to an end, then there shall be the highest concord of both substances; then to such a degree shall no one there be carnal, that even the flesh itself shall be spiritual. What therefore each one living after Christ doth with his flesh, whereas he both lusts against its evil lust, which he restrains, hereafter to be healed, which he holds, not yet healed; and yet nourisheth and cherisheth its good nature, since \"no one ever hated his own flesh,\"[fn-36-P3699_1745393:101-nf] this also Christ doth with the Church, so far as it is lawful to compare lesser with greater matters. For He both represses it with rebukes, that it burst not being puffed up with impunity; and raises it up with consolations, that it sink not being weighed down with infirmity. Hence is that of the Apostle, \"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are rebuked of the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.\"[fn-37-P3700_1745874:102-nf] And that in the Psalm, \"After the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have gladdened my soul.\"[fn-37-P3701_1746012:103-nf] We are therefore then to hope for perfect soundness of our flesh without any opposition, when there shall be sure security of the Church of Christ without any fear.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_31_book_i_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"For whence comes it that he is so careless about the Scriptures, which he talks of, as not to notice that when he reads of human beings being from God, it is not merely, as he contends, in respect of their soul and spirit, but also as regards their body?

Hence it follows that if the apostle, when he said the words we have quoted from him, spoke of men's bodies, undoubtedly the bodies of persons of both sexes are of God. Furthermore, if he insists that nothing in man comes from God except their souls and spirits, then, of course, the woman is of the man even as regards her soul and spirit; so that nothing is left to those who dispute against the propagation of souls. But if he is for dividing the subject in such a manner as to say that the woman is of the man as regards her body, but is of God in respect of her soul and spirit, how, then, will that be true which the apostle says, \"All things of God,\" if the woman's body is of the man in such a sense that it is not of God?

But what reasons does (the apostle) allege for continence? Because \"the time is short.\"[fn-74-P7478_2148427:313-nf] I had almost thought it was because in Christ there was another god!

But when he says, \"although there be that are called gods, whether in l heaven or in earth,\"[fn-74-P7480_2149111:315-nf] the meaning of his words is clear-not as if there were gods in reality, but as if there were some who are called gods, without being truly so. He introduces his discussion about meats offered to idols with a statement concerning idols (themselves): \"We know that an idol is nothing in the world.\"[fn-74-P7481_2149431:316-nf] Marcion, however, does not say that the Creator is not God; so that the apostle can hardly be thought to have ranked the Creator amongst those who are called gods, without being so; since, even if they had been gods, \"to us there is but one God, the Father.\"[fn-74-P7482_2149713:317-nf] Now, from whom do all things come to us, but from Him to whom all things belong? And pray, what things are these?

From Him, therefore, amongst the \"all things\" comes also Christ.[fn-74-P7484_2150275:319-nf] When he teaches that every man ought to live of his own industry,[fn-74-P7485_2150364:320-nf] he begins with a copious induction of examples-of soldiers, and shepherds, and husbandmen.[fn-74-P7486_2150477:321-nf] But he[fn-74-P7487_2150505:322-nf] wanted divine authority. What was the use, however, of adducing the Creator's, which he was destroying? It was vain to do so; for his god had no such authority! (The apostle) says: \"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,\"[fn-74-P7488_2150779:323-nf] and adds: \"Doth God take care of oxen? \"Yes, of oxen, for the sake of men! For, says he, \"it is written for our sakes.\"[fn-74-P7489_2150937:324-nf] Thus he showed that the law had a symbolic reference to ourselves, and that it gives its sanction in favour of those who live of the gospel. (He showed) also, that those who preach the gospel are on this account sent by no other god but Him to whom belongs the law, which made provision for them, when he says: \"For our sakes was this writ. ten.\"[fn-74-P7490_2151306:325-nf] Still he declined to use this power which the law gave him, because he preferred working without any restraint.[fn-74-P7491_2151474:326-nf] Of this he boasted, and suffered no man to rob him of such glory[fn-74-P7492_2151554:327-nf] -certainly with no view of destroying the law, which he proved that another man might use. For behold Marcion, in his blindness, stumbled at the rock whereof our fathers drank in the wilderness. For since \"that rock was Christ,\"[fn-74-P7493_2151805:328-nf] it was, of course, the Creator's, to whom also belonged the people. But why resort to the figure of a sacred sign given by an extraneous god?[fn-74-P7494_2151967:329-nf] Was it to teach the very truth, that ancient things prefigured the Christ who was to be educed[fn-74-P7495_2152098:330-nf] out of them? For, being about to take a cursory view of what befell the people (of Israel) he begins with saying: \"Now these things happened as examples for us.\"[fn-74-P7496_2152280:331-nf] Now, tell me, were these examples given by the Creator to men belonging to a rival god? Or did one god borrow examples from another, and a hostile one too? He withdraws me to himself in alarm[fn-74-P7497_2152492:332-nf] from Him from whom he transfers my allegiance. Will his antagonist make me better disposed to him? Should I now commit the same sins as the people, shall I have to suffer the same penalties, or not?[fn-74-P7498_2152714:333-nf] But if not the same, how vainly does he propose to me terrors which I shall not have to endure! From whom, again, shall I have to endure them? If from the Creator, What evils does it appertain to Him to inflict? And how will it happen that, jealous God as He is, He shall punish the man who offends His rival, instead of rather encouraging[fn-74-P7499_2153077:334-nf] him. If, however, from the other god-but he knows not how to punish. So that the whole declaration of the apostle lacks a reasonable basis, if it is not meant to relate to the Creator's discipline. But the fact is, the apostle's conclusion corresponds to the beginning: \"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-75-P7500_2153513:335-nf] What a Creator! how prescient already, and considerate in warning Christians who belong to another god! Whenever cavils occur the like to those which have been already dealt with, I pass them by; certain others I despatch briefly. A great argument for another god is the permission to eat of all kinds of meats, contrary to the law.[fn-75-P7501_2153867:336-nf] Just as if we did not ourselves allow that the burdensome ordinances of the law were abrogated-but by Him who imposed them, who also promised the new condition of things.[fn-75-P7502_2154063:337-nf] The same, therefore, who prohibited meats, also restored the use of them, just as He had indeed allowed them from the beginning.

We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God. Here, then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"The head of every man is Christ.\"[fn-75-P7506_2154731:338-nf] What Christ, if He is not the author of man?

Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards: \"The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-75-P7507_2155063:339-nf] Since then he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become man, said, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness\"[fn-75-P7508_2155252:340-nf] ), how can I possibly have another head but Him whose image I am?

He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty.

He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God. Here, then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"The head of every man is Christ.\"[fn-75-P7506_2154731:338-nf] What Christ, if He is not the author of man? The head he has here put for authority; now \"authority\" will accrue to none else than the \"author.\" Of what man indeed is He the head? Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards: \"The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-75-P7507_2155063:339-nf] Since then he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become man, said, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness\"[fn-75-P7508_2155252:340-nf] ), how can I possibly have another head but Him whose image I am? For if I am the image of the Creator there is no room in me for another head But wherefore \"ought the woman to have power over her head, because of the angels? \"[fn-75-P7509_2155499:341-nf] If it is because \"she was created for the man,\"[fn-75-P7510_2155569:342-nf] and taken out of the man, according to the Creator's purpose, then in this way too has the apostle maintained the discipline of that God from whose institution he explains the reasons of His discipline. He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata.

Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it.

This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God. Here, then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"The head of every man is Christ.\"[fn-75-P7506_2154731:338-nf] What Christ, if He is not the author of man? The head he has here put for authority; now \"authority\" will accrue to none else than the \"author.\" Of what man indeed is He the head? Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards: \"The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-75-P7507_2155063:339-nf] Since then he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become man, said, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness\"[fn-75-P7508_2155252:340-nf] ), how can I possibly have another head but Him whose image I am? For if I am the image of the Creator there is no room in me for another head But wherefore \"ought the woman to have power over her head, because of the angels? \"[fn-75-P7509_2155499:341-nf] If it is because \"she was created for the man,\"[fn-75-P7510_2155569:342-nf] and taken out of the man, according to the Creator's purpose, then in this way too has the apostle maintained the discipline of that God from whose institution he explains the reasons of His discipline. He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it.

Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his.

But if any one should venture to oppose this statement, and reply, that the apostle teaches that we hate not only the evil which is in thought, but that we do that which we will not, and we hate it even in the very act of doing it, for he says,\" The good which I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do; \"[fn-58-P5872_1779261:75-nf] if he who says so speaks the truth, let us ask him to explain what was the evil which the apostle hated and willed not to do, but did; and the good which he willed to do, but did not; and conversely, whether as often as he willed to do good, so often he did not do the good which he willed, but did the evil which he willed not? And how he can say, when exhorting us to shake off all manner of sin, \"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ? \"[fn-58-P5873_1779734:76-nf] Thus he meant the things already mentioned which he willed not to do, not to be done, but only to be thought of. For how otherwise could he be an exact imitation of Christ? It would be excellent then, and most delightful, if we had not those who oppose us, and contend with us; but since this is impossible, we cannot do what we will. For we will not to have those who lead us to passion, for then we could be saved without weariness and effort; but that does not come to pass which we will, but that which we will not. For it is necessary, as I said, that we should be tried. Let us not then, O my soul, let us not give in to the Evil One; but putting on\" the whole armour of God,\" which is our protection, let us have \"the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel (of peace).

For remember how it has been already shown that, from the time when man went astray and disobeyed the law, thence sin, receiving its birth from his disobedience, dwelt in him. For thus a commotion was stirred up, and we were filled with agitations and foreign imaginations, being emptied of the divine inspiration and filled with carnal desire, which the cunning serpent infused into us. And, therefore, God invented death for our sakes, that He might destroy sin, lest rising up in us immortals, as I said, it should be immortal. When the apostle says, \"for I know that in me-that is, in my flesh-dwelleth no good thing,\" by which words he means to indicate that sin dwells in us, from the transgression, through lust; out of which, like young shoots, the imaginations of pleasure rise around us. For there are two kinds of thoughts in us; the one which arises from the lust which lies in the body, which, as I said, came from the craft of the Evil Spirit; the other from the law, which is in accordance with the commandment, which we had implanted in us as a natural law, stirring up our thoughts to good, when we delight in the law of God according to our mind, for this is the inner man; but in the law of the devil according to the lust which dwells in the flesh.

The third rule relates to the promises and the law, and may be designated in other terms as relating to the spirit and the letter, which is the name I made use of when writing a book on this subject. It may be also named, of grace and the law. This, however, seems to me to be a great question in itself, rather than a rule to be applied to the solution of other questions. It was the want of clear views on this question that originated, or at least greatly aggravated, the Pelagian heresy. And the efforts of Tichonius to clear up this point were good, but not complete. For, in discussing the question about faith and works, he said that works were given us by God as the reward of faith, but that faith itself was so far our own that it did not come to us from God; not keeping in mind the saying of the apostle: \"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-52-P5234_2779975:73-nf] But he had not come into contact with this heresy, which has arisen in our time, and has given us much labor and trouble in defending against it the grace of God which is through our Lord Jesus Christ, and which (according to the saying of the apostle, \"There must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you\"[fn-52-P5235_2780347:74-nf] ) has made us much more watchful and diligent to discover in Scripture what escaped Tichonius, who, having no enemy to guard against, was less attentive and anxious on this point, namely, that even faith itself is the gift of Him who \"hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.\"[fn-52-P5236_2780649:75-nf] Whence it is said to certain believers: \"Unto you it is given, in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\"[fn-52-P5237_2780817:76-nf] Who, then, can doubt that each of these is the gift of God, when he learns from this passage, and believes, that each of them is given?

Yes, if we live religiously, if we believe Christ, if we do not desire to fly out of the nest before the time, they only bring us to this-to the knowledge of mysteries. Mark then, holy brethren,[fn-29-P2936_1297014:32-nf] the usefulness of heretics; their usefulness, that is, in respect of the designs of God, who makes a good use even of those that are bad; whereas, as regards themselves, the fruit of their own designs is rendered to them, and not that good which God brings out of them. Just as in the case of Judas; what great good did he! By the Lord's Passion all nations are saved; but that the Lord might suffer, Judas betrayed Him. God then both delivers the nations by the Passion of His Son, and punishes Judas for his own wickedness. For the mysteries which lie hid in Scripture, no one who is content with the simplicity of the faith would curiously sift them, and therefore as no one would sift them, no one would discover them but for cavillers who force us. For when heretics cavil, the little ones are disturbed; when disturbed, they make search, and their search is, so to say, a beating of the head at the mother's breasts, that they may yieldas much milk as is sufficient for these little ones. They search then, because they are troubled; but they who know and have learnt these things, because they have investigated them, and God hath opened to their knocking, they in their turn open to those who are in trouble. And so it happens that heretics serve usefully for the discovery of the truth, whilst they cavil to seduce men into error.

He might say that Christ was angry with both His friends and His enemies: with His friends, because He said, \"The servant that knows his lord's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes;\" and with His enemies, because He said, \"If any one shall not receive you, shake off against him the dust of your shoes; verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for that city;\"[fn-20-P2059_1207896:27-nf] as Faustus accuses God of being angry at one time with His friends, and at another with His enemies; both of whom are spoken of thus by the apostle: \"They that have sinned without law shall perish without law, and they that have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-20-P2060_1208194:28-nf] Or he might say that Christ shed the blood of many without mercy, for a slight offense or for nothing. For to a Pagan there would appear to be little or no harm in not having a wedding garment at the marriage feast, for which our King in the Gospel commanded a man to be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness;[fn-20-P2061_1208534:29-nf] or in not wishing to have Christ for a king, which is the sin of which Christ says, \"Those that would not have me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me;\"[fn-20-P2062_1208727:30-nf] as Faustus blames God in the Old Testament for slaughtering thousands of human beings for slight offenses, as Faustus calls them, or for nothing. Again, if Faustus finds fault with God's threatening to come with the sword, and to spare neither the righteous nor the wicked, might not the Pagan. find as much fault with the words of the Apostle Paul, when he says of our God,\" He spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all;\"[fn-20-P2063_1209178:31-nf] or of Peter, when, in exhorting the saints to be patient in the midst of persecution and slaughter, he says, \"It is time that judgment begin from the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that believe not the gospel of the Lord? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?\"[fn-20-P2064_1209546:32-nf] What can be more righteous than the Only-Begotten, whom nevertheless the Father did not spare? And what can be plainer than that the righteous also are not spared, but chastised with manifold afflictions, as is clearly implied in the words, \"If the righteous scarcely are saved\"? As it is said in the Old Testament, \"Whom the Lord loveth He correcteth, and chastiseth every son whom He receiveth;\"[fn-20-P2065_1209968:33-nf] and, \"If we receive good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not also receive evil?\"[fn-20-P2066_1210071:34-nf] So we read also in the New Testament, \"Whom I love I rebuke and chasten;\"[fn-20-P2067_1210162:35-nf] and, \"If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of the Lord; but when we are judged, we are corrected of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.\"[fn-20-P2068_1210346:36-nf] If a Pagan were to make such objections to the New Testament, would not the Manichaeans try to answer them, though they themselves make similar objections to the Old Testament? But supposing them able to answer the Pagan, how absurd it would be to defend in the one Testament what they find fault with in the other! But if they could not answer the objections of the Pagan, why should they not allow in both Testaments, instead of in one only, that what appears wrong to unbelievers, from their ignorance, should be believed to be right by pious readers even when they also are ignorant?","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_37_of_the_work_of_monks_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"39.

Augustin replied: The Apostle Paul certainly uses the expression the inner man for the spirit of the mind, and the outer man for the body and for this mortal life; but we nowhere find him making these two different men, but one, which is all made by God, both the inner and the outer. However, it is made in the image of God only as regards the inner, which, besides being immaterial, is rational, and is not possessed by the lower animals. God, then, did not make one man after His own image, and another man not after that image; but the one man, which includes both the inner and the outer, He made after His own image, not as regards the possession of a body and of mortal life, but as regards the rational mind with the power of knowing God, and with the superiority as compared with all irrational creatures which the possession of reason implies. Faustus allows that the inner man is made by God, when, as he says, it is renewed in the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him. I readily admit this on the apostle's authority. Why does not Faustus admit on the same authority that \"God has placed the members every one in the body, as it has pleased Him\"?[fn-23-P2350_1423689:9-nf] Here we learn from the same apostle that God is the framer of the outer man too. Why does Faustus take only what he thinks to be in his own favor, while he leaves out or rejects what upsets the follies of the Manichaeans? Moreover, in treating of the earthy and the heavenly man, and making the distinction between the mortal and the immortal, between that which we are in Adam and that which we shall be in Christ, the apostle quotes the declaration of the law regarding the earthy or natural body, referring to the very book and the very passage where it is written that God made the earthy man too. Speaking of the manner in which the dead shall rise again, and of the body with which they shall come, after using the similitude of the seeds of corn, that they are sown bare grain, and that God gives them a body as it pleases Him, and to every seed his own body,-thus, by the way, overthrowing the error of the Manichaeans, who say that grains and plants, and all roots and shoots, are created by the race of darkness, and not by God, who, according to them, instead of exerting power in the production of these objects, is Himself subject to confinement in them,-he goes on, after this refutation of Manichaean impieties, to describe the different kinds of flesh. \"All flesh,\" he says, \"is not the same flesh.\" Then he speaks of celestial and terrestrial bodies, and then of the change of our body by which it will become spiritual and heavenly. \"It is sown,\" he says, \"in dishonor, it shall rise in glory; it is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power; it is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body.\" Then, in order to show the origin of the animal body, he says, \"There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body; as it is written, The first man, Adam, was made a living soul.\"[fn-23-P2351_1425513:10-nf] Now this is written in Genesis,[fn-23-P2352_1425568:11-nf] where it is related how God made man, and animated the body which He had formed of the earth. By the old man the apostle simply means the old life, which is a life in sin, and is after the manner of Adam, of whom it is said, \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned.\"[fn-23-P2353_1425928:12-nf] Thus the whole of this man, both the inner and the outer part, has become old because of sin, and liable to the punishment of mortality. There is, however, a restoration of the inner man, when it is renewed after the image of its Creator, in the putting off of unrighteousness-that is, the old man, and putting on righteousness-that is, the new man. But when that which is sown a natural body shall rise a spiritual body, the outer man too shall attain the dignity of a celestial character; so that all that has been created may be created anew, and all that has been made be remade by the Creator and Maker Himself. This is briefly explained in the words: \"The body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit dwelling in you.\"[fn-23-P2354_1426867:13-nf] No one instructed in the Catholic doctrine but knows that it is in the body that some are male and some female, not in the spirit of the mind, in which we are renewed after the image of God. But elsewhere the apostle teaches that God is the Maker of both; for he says, \"Neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord; for as the woman is of the man, so is the man by the woman; but all things are of God.\"[fn-23-P2355_1427331:14-nf] The only reply given to this, by the perverse stupidity of those who are alienated from the life of God by the ignorance which is in them, on account of the blindness of their heart, is, that whatever pleases them in the apostolic writings is true, and whatever displeases them is false. This is the insanity of the Manichaeans, who will be wise if they cease to be Manichaeans. As it is, if they are asked whether it is He that remakes and renews the inner man (which they acknowledge to be renewed after the image of God, and they themselves quote the passage in support of this; and, according to Faustus, God makes man when the inner man is renewed in the image of God), they will answer, yes. And if we then go on to ask when God made what He now renews, they must devise some subterfuge to prevent the exposure of their absurdities. For, according to them, the inner man is not formed or created or originated by God, but is part of His own substance sent against His enemies; and instead of becoming old by sin, it is through necessity captured and damaged by the enemy. Not to repeat all the nonsense they talk, the first man they speak of is not the man of the earth earthy that the apostle speaks of,[fn-23-P2356_1428566:15-nf] but an invention proceeding from their own magazine of untruths. Faustus, though he chooses man as a subject for discussion, says not a word of this first man; for he is afraid that his opponents in the discussion might come to know something about him.","title":"Book XXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"147","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now it is no matter of surprise if arguments are captiously taken from the writings of (the apostle) himself, inasmuch as there \"must needs be heresies; \"[fn-100-P10059_2797637:260-nf] but these could not be, if the Scriptures were not capable of a false interpretation. Well, then, heresies finding that the apostle had mentioned two \"men\"-\"the inner man,\" that is, the soul, and \"the outward man,\" that is, the flesh-awarded salvation to the soul or inward man, and destruction to the flesh or outward man, because it is written (in the Epistle) to the Corinthians: \"Though our outward man decayeth, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.\"[fn-100-P10060_2798119:261-nf] Now, neither the soul by itself alone is \"man\" (it was subsequently implanted in the clayey mould to which the name man had been already given), nor is the flesh without the soul \"man \": for after the exile of the soul from it, it has the title of corpse. Thus the designation man is, in a certain sense, the bond between the two closely united substances, under which designation they cannot but be coherent natures. As for the inward man, indeed, the apostle prefers its being regarded as the mind and heart[fn-100-P10061_2798651:262-nf] rather than the soul;[fn-100-P10062_2798688:263-nf] in other words, not so much the substance itself as the savour of the substance. Thus when, writing to the Ephesians, he spoke of \"Christ dwelling in their inner man,\" he meant, no doubt, that the Lord ought to be admitted into their senses.[fn-100-P10063_2798945:264-nf] He then added, \"in your hearts by faith, rooted and grounded in love,\"-making \"faith\" and \"love\" not substantial parts, but only conceptions of the soul. But when he used the phrase \"in your hearts,\" seeing that these are substantial parts of the flesh, he at once assigned to the flesh the actual \"inward man,\" which he placed in the heart. Consider now in what sense he alleged that \"the outward man decayeth, while the inward man is renewed day by day.\" You certainly would not maintain that he could mean that corruption of the flesh which it undergoes from the moment of death, in its appointed state of perpetual decay; but the wear and tear which for the name of Christ it experiences during its course of life before and until death, in harassing cares and tribulations as well as in tortures and persecutions. Now the inward man will have, of course, to be renewed by the suggestion of the Spirit, advancing by faith and holiness day after day, here in this life, not there after the resurrection, were our renewal is not a gradual process from day to day, but a consummation once for all complete. You may learn this, too, from the following passage, where the apostle says: \"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for as a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen,\" that is, our sufferings, \"but at the things which are not seen,\" that is, our rewards: \"for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\"[fn-100-P10064_2800499:265-nf] For the afflictions and injuries wherewith the outward man is worn away, he affirms to be only worthy of being despised by us, as being light and temporary; preferring those eternal recompenses which are also invisible, and that \"weight of glory\" which will be a counterpoise for the labours in the endurance of which the flesh here suffers decay. So that the subject in this passage is not that corruption which they ascribe to the outward man in the utter destruction of the flesh, with the view of nullifying the resurrection. So also he says elsewhere: \"If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together; for I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.\"[fn-100-P10065_2801286:266-nf] Here again he shows us that our sufferings are less than their rewards. Now, since it is through the flesh that we suffer with Christ-for it is the property of the flesh to be worn by sufferings-to the same flesh belongs the recompense which is promised for suffering with Christ. Accordingly, when he is going to assign afflictions to the flesh as its especial liability-according to the statement he had already made-he says, \"When we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest; \"[fn-100-P10066_2801800:267-nf] then, in order to make the soul a fellow-sufferer with the body, he adds, \"We were troubled on every side; without were fightings,\" which of course warred down the flesh, \"within were fears,\" which afflicted the soul.[fn-100-P10067_2802040:268-nf] Although, therefore, the outward man decays-not in the sense of missing the resurrection, but of enduring tribulation-it will be understood from this scripture that it is not exposed to its suffering without the inward man. Both therefore, will be glorified together, even as they have suffered together. Parallel with their participation in troubles, must necessarily run their association also in rewards.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":65,"source_paragraph":"194","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And so the flesh shall rise again, wholly in every man, in its own identity, in its absolute integrity.

The flesh, too, has her departures for a while-in waters, in fires, in birds, in beasts; she may seem to be dissolved into these, but she is only poured into them, as into vessels. And should the vessels themselves afterwards fail to hold her, escaping from even these, and returning to her mother earth, she is absorbed once more, as it were, by its secret embraces, ultimately to stand forth to view, like Adam when summoned to hear from his Lord and Creator the words, \"Behold, the man is become as one of us!\"[fn-103-P10342_2899959:473-nf] -thoroughly \"knowing\" by that time \"the evil\" which she had escaped, \"and the good\" which she has acquired. Why, then, O soul, should you envy the flesh? There is none, after the Lord, whom you should love so dearly; none more like a brother to you, which is even born along with yourself in God. You ought rather to have been by your prayers obtaining resurrection for her: her sins, whatever they were, were owing to you. However, it is no wonder if you hate her; for you have repudiated her Creator.[fn-103-P10343_2900483:474-nf] You have accustomed yourself either to deny or change her existence even in Christ[fn-103-P10344_2900635:475-nf] -corrupting the very Word of God Himself, who became flesh, either by mutilating or misinterpreting the Scripture,[fn-103-P10345_2900787:476-nf] and introducing, above all, apocryphal mysteries and blasphemous fables.[fn-103-P10346_2901156:477-nf] But yet Almighty God, in His most gracious providence, by \"pouring out of His Spirit in these last days, upon all flesh, upon His servants and on His handmaidens,\"[fn-103-P10347_2901362:478-nf] has checked these impostures of unbelief and perverseness, reanimated men's faltering faith in the resurrection of the flesh, and cleared from all obscurity and equivocation the ancient Scriptures (of both God's Testaments[fn-103-P10348_2901834:479-nf] ) by the clear light of their (sacred) words and meanings. Now, since it was \"needful that there should be heresies, in order that they which are approved might be made manifest; \"[fn-103-P10349_2902066:480-nf] since, however, these heresies would be unable to put on a bold front without some countenance from the Scriptures, it therefore is plain enough that the ancient Holy Writ has furnished them with sundry materials for their evil doctrine, which very materials indeed (so distorted) are refutable from the same Scriptures. It was fit and proper, therefore, that the Holy Ghost should no longer withhold the effusions of His gracious light upon these inspired writings, in order that they might be able to disseminate the seeds of truth with no admixture of heretical subtleties, and pluck out from it their tares. He has accordingly now dispersed all the perplexities of the past, and their self-chosen allegories and parables, by the open and perspicuous explanation of the entire mystery, through the new prophecy, which descends in copious streams from the Paraclete. If you will only draw water from His fountains, you will never thirst for other doctrine: no feverish craving after subtle questions will again consume you; but by drinking in evermore the resurrection of the flesh, you will be satisfied with the refreshing draughts.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_34_rufinus_s_epilogue_to_pamphilus_the_martyr_s_apology_for_origen","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"What has been said may suffice to show what opinion we ought to form of the books of Origen.

When Moses in Egypt desired to see the face of the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself unto me, that I may see Thee and know Thee,\"[fn-105-P10573_2968798:154-nf] God said, \"Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live: \"[fn-105-P10574_2968903:155-nf] in other words, he who sees me shall die. Now we find that God has been seen by many persons, and yet that no one who saw Him died (at the sight). The truth is, they saw God according to the faculties of men, but not in accordance with the full glory of the Godhead. For the patriarchs are said to have seen God (as Abraham and Jacob), and the prophets (as, for instance Isaiah and Ezekiel), and yet they did not die. Either, then, they ought to have died, since they had seen Him-for (the sentence runs), \"No man shall see God, and live ; \"or else if they saw God, and yet did not die, the Scripture is false in stating that God said, \"If a man see my face, he shall not live.\" Either way, the Scripture misleads us, when it makes God invisible, and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must be a different Being who was seen, because of one who was seen it could not be predicated that He is invisible. It will therefore follow, that by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fulness of His majesty, while we recognise the Son as visible by reason of the dispensation of His derived existence;[fn-105-P10575_2970046:156-nf] even as it is not permitted us to contemplate, the sun, in the full amount of his substance which is in the heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray, by reason of the tempered condition of this portion which is projected from him to the earth. Here some one on the other side may be disposed to contend that the Son is also invisible as being the Word, and as being also the Spirit;[fn-105-P10576_2970472:157-nf] and, while claiming one nature for the Father and the Son, to affirm that the Father is rather One and the Same Person with the Son. But the Scripture, as we have said, maintains their difference by the distinction it makes between the Visible and the Invisible. They then go on to argue to this effect, that if it was the Son who then spake to Moses, He must mean it of Himself that His face was visible to no one, because He was Himself indeed the invisible Father in the name of the Son. And by this means they will have it that the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same, just as the Father and the Son are the same; (and this they maintain) because in a preceding passage, before He had refused (the sight of) His face to Moses, the Scripture informs us that \"the Lord spake face to face with Moses, even as a man speaketh unto his friend; \"[fn-105-P10577_2971380:158-nf] just as Jacob also says, \"I have seen God face to face.\"[fn-105-P10578_2971460:159-nf] Therefore the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same; and both being thus the same, it follows that He is invisible as the Father, and visible as the Son. As if the Scripture, according to our exposition of it, were inapplicable to the Son, when the Father is set aside in His own invisibility. We declare, however, that the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is invisible, in that He is God, and the Word and Spirit of God; but that He was visible before the days of His flesh, in the way that He says to Aaron and Miriam, \"And if there shall be a prophet amongst you, I will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream; not as with Moses, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, that is to say, in truth, and not enigmatically\" that is to say, in image;[fn-105-P10579_2972302:160-nf] as the apostle also expresses it, \"Now we see through a glass, darkly (or enigmatically), but then face to face.\"[fn-105-P10580_2972438:161-nf] Since, therefore, He reserves to some future time His presence and speech face to face with Moses-a promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount (of transfiguration), when as we read in the Gospel,\" Moses appeared talking with Jesus\"[fn-105-P10581_2972721:162-nf] -it is evident that in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were, )and an enigma, in vision and dream, that God, I mean the Son of God, appeared-to the prophets and the patriarchs, as also to Moses indeed himself. And even if the Lord did possibly[fn-105-P10582_2973011:163-nf] speak with him face to face, yet it was not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a glass, (as it were, ) and by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spake with Moses, that Moses actually discerned His face, eye to eye,[fn-105-P10583_2973267:164-nf] how comes it to pass that immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he desires to see His face,[fn-105-P10584_2973391:165-nf] which he ought not to have desired, because he had already seen it? And how, in like manner, does the Lord also Say that His face cannot be seen, because He had shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose.) Or what is that fade of God, the sight of which is refused, if there was one which was visible to man? \"I have seen God,\" says Jacob, \"face to face, and my life is preserved.\"[fn-105-P10585_2973840:166-nf] There ought to be some other face which kills if it be only seen. Well, then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not,[fn-105-P10586_2973973:167-nf] ) although He was the face of God, except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because the Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form. But, (they say, ) He calls the invisible Father His face. For who is the Father? Must He not be the face of the Son, by reason of that authority which He obtains as the begotten of the Father? For is there not a natural propriety in saying of some personage greater (than yourself), That man is my face; he gives me his countenance? \"My Father,\"says Christ, \"is greater than I.\"[fn-105-P10587_2974560:168-nf] Therefore the Father must be the face of the Son. For what does the Scripture say? \"The Spirit of His person is Christ the Lord.\"[fn-105-P10588_2974711:169-nf] As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father's person, there is good reason why, in virtue indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose person He belonged-that is to say, the Father-pronounced Him to be His \"face.\" Now this, to be sure, is an astonishing thing, that the Father can be taken to be the face of the Son, when He is His head; for \"the head of Christ is God.\"[fn-105-P10589_2975553:170-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_13_book_ix_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-05","text":"A lengthened conflict, then, having been maintained concerning all heresies by us who, at all events, have not left any unrefuted, the greatest struggle now remains behind, viz., to furnish an account and refutation of those heresies that have sprung up in our own day, by which certain ignorant and presumptuous men have attempted to scatter abroad the Church, and have introduced the greatest confusion[fn-21-P2143_667743:3-nf] among all the faithful throughout the entire world.

Here they find it to be the name of the sex, not a class of the sex: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname \"woman\" and \"female\"[fn-119-P11946_3335110:116-nf] -(\"female,\" whereby the sex generally; \"woman,\" hereby a class of the sex, is marked).[fn-119-P11947_3335285:117-nf] So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word \"woman,\" that word has been made common even to a virgin.[fn-119-P11948_3335569:118-nf] Nor is it wonderful that the apostle-guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up-has used the selfsame word in writing \"women,\" which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a \"virgin.\" In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not named \"virgins\" (as he does in another place[fn-119-P11949_3336175:119-nf] where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching every woman, and touching the whole sex; and that there is no distinction made between a \"virgin\" and any other, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere-namely, where the difference requires-remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names, ) wishes, where he makes no distinction (while he does not name each), no difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, \"women\" rather than \"females; \"that is, gunai=kaj (gunaikas) rather than qhlei/aj (theleias)? Therefore if that word,[fn-119-P11950_3336952:120-nf] which by interpretation represents what \"female\" (femina) represents,[fn-119-P11951_3337036:121-nf] is frequently used instead of the name of the sex[fn-119-P11952_3337467:122-nf] he has named the sex in saying gunai=ka; but in the sex even the virgin is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: \"Every woman,\" saith he, \"praying and prophesying with head uncovered,[fn-119-P11953_3337678:123-nf] dishonoureth her own head.\"[fn-119-P11954_3337729:124-nf] What is \"every woman, but woman of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying\" every\" he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from not being covered; for just so he says, \"Every man.\"[fn-119-P11955_3337983:125-nf] As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of\" man\" even the\" youth\" is forbidden to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of \"woman,\" even the \"virgin\" is bidden to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male \"virgins,\"[fn-119-P11956_3338307:126-nf] too, be veiled, if the female virgins withal are not veiled, because they are not mentioned by name. Let \"man\" and \"youth\" be different, if \"woman\" and \"virgin\" are different. For indeed it is \"on account of the angels\"[fn-119-P11957_3338591:127-nf] that he saith women must be veiled, because on account of \"the daughters of men\" angels revolted from God.[fn-119-P11958_3338720:128-nf] Who then, would contend that \"women\" alone-that is,[fn-119-P11959_3339001:129-nf] such as were already wedded and had lost their virginity-were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless \"virgins\" are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not virgins alone whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith \"the daughters of men; \"[fn-119-P11960_3339369:130-nf] inasmuch as it might have named \"wives of men,\" or \"females,\" indifferently.[fn-119-P11961_3339465:131-nf] Likewise, in that it saith, \"And they took them to themselves for wives,\"[fn-119-P11962_3339657:132-nf] it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are \"received for wives\" as are devoid of that title.

All things that are read from the Holy Scriptures in order to our instruction and salvation, it behoves us to hear with earnest heed. Yet most of all must those things be commended to our memory, which are of most force against heretics; whose insidious designs cease not to circumvent all that are weaker and more negligent. Remember that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ both died for us, and rose again; died, to wit, for our offenses, rose again for our justification.[fn-40-P4056_2225496:2-nf] Even as ye have just heard concerning the two disciples whom He met with in the way, how \"their eyes were holden that they should not know Him:\"[fn-40-P4057_2225658:3-nf] and He found them despairing of the redemption that was in Christ, and deeming that now He had suffered and was dead as a man, not accounting that as Son of God He ever liveth; and deeming too that He was so dead in the flesh as not to come to life again, but just as one of the prophets: as those of you who were attentive have just now heard their own words. Then\"He opened to them the Scriptures, beginning at Moses,\" and going through all the prophets, showing them that all He had suffered had been foretold, lest they should be more staggered if the Lord should rise again, and the more fail to believe Him, if these things had not been told before concerning Him. For the firmness of faith is in this, that all things which came to pass in Christ were foretold. The disciples, then, knew Him not, save \"in the breaking of bread.\" And truly he that eateth and drinketh not judgment to himself in the breaking of bread doth know Christ.[fn-40-P4058_2226621:4-nf] Afterward also those eleven \"thought they saw a spirit.\" He gave Himself to be handled by them, who also gave Himself to be crucified; to be crucified by enemies, to be handled by friends: yet the Physician of all, both of the ungodliness of those, and of the unbelief of these. For ye heard when the Acts of the Apostles were read, how many thousands of Christ's slayers believed.[fn-40-P4059_2227021:5-nf] If those believed afterwards who had killed, should not those believe who for a little while doubted? And yet even in regard of them, (a thing which ye ought especially to observe, and to commit to your memory, because that which shall make us strong against insidious errors, God has been pleased to put in the Scriptures, against which no man dares to speak, who in any sort wishes to seem a Christian), when He had given Himself to be handled by them, that did not suffice Him, but He would also confirm by means of the Scriptures the heart of them that believe: for He looked forward to us who should be afterwards; seeing that in Him we have nothing that we can handle, but have that which we may read. For if those believed only because they held and handled, what shall we do? Now, Christ is ascended into heaven; He is not to come save at the end, to judge the quick and the dead. Whereby shall we believe, but by that whereby it was His will that even those who handled Him should be confirmed? For He opened to them the Scriptures and showed them that it behoved Christ to suffer, and that all things should be fulfilled which were written of Him in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms. He embraced in His discourse the whole ancient text of the Scriptures. All that there is of those former Scriptures tells of Christ; but only if it find ears.

For you may see such people, liker swine or dogs for gluttony than men, in such a hurry to feed themselves full, that both jaws are stuffed out at once, the veins about the face raised, and besides, the perspiration running all over, as they are tightened with their insatiable greed, and panting with their excess; the food pushed with unsocial eagerness into their stomach, as if they were stowing away their victuals for provision for a journey, not for digestion. Excess, which in all things is an evil, is very highly reprehensible in the matter of food. Gluttony, called o0yofagi/a, is nothing but excess in the use of relishes (o !yon); and laimargi/a is insanity with respect to the gullet; and gastrimargi/a is excess with respect to food-insanity in reference to the belly, as the name implies; for ma/rgoj is a madman. The apostle, checking those that transgress in their conduct at entertainments,[fn-37-P3750_1138624:34-nf] says: \"For every one taketh beforehand in eating his own supper; and one is hungry, and another drunken.

We are to partake of what is set before us, as becomes a Christian, out of respect to him who has invited us, by a harmless and moderate participation in the social meeting; regarding the sumptuousness of what is put on the table as a matter of indifference, despising the dainties, as after a little destined to perish. \"Let him who eateth, not despise him who eateth not; and let him who eateth not, not judge him who eateth.\"[fn-37-P3742_1134943:26-nf] And a little way on he explains the reason of the command, when he says, \"He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, and giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.\"[fn-37-P3743_1135170:27-nf] So that the right food is thanksgiving. And he who gives thanks does not occupy his time in pleasures. And if we would persuade any of our fellow-guests to virtue, we are all the more on this account to abstain from those dainty dishes; and so exhibit ourselves as a bright pattern of virtue, such as we ourselves have in Christ. \"For if any of such meats make a brother to stumble, I shall not eat it as long as the world lasts,\" says he, \"that I may not make my brother stumble.\"[fn-37-P3744_1135670:28-nf] I gain the man by a little self-restraint. \"Have we not power to eat and to drink? \"[fn-37-P3745_1135777:29-nf] And \"we know\"-he says the truth-\"that an idol is nothing in the world; but we have only one true God, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus. But,\" he says, \"through thy knowledge thy weak brother perishes, for whom Christ died; and they that wound the conscience of the weak brethren sin against Christ.\"[fn-37-P3746_1136107:30-nf] Thus the apostle, in his solicitude for us, discriminates in the case of entertainments, saying, that \"if any one called a brother be found a fornicator, or an adulterer, or an idolater, with such an one not to eat; \"[fn-37-P3747_1136354:31-nf] neither in discourse or food are we to join, looking with suspicion on the pollution thence proceeding, as on the tables of the demons. \"It is good, then, neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine,\"[fn-37-P3748_1136569:32-nf] as both he and the Pythagoreans acknowledge. For this is rather characteristic of a beast; and the fumes arising from them being dense, darken the soul. If one partakes of them, he does not sin.

For a voice will whisper to him, saying, \"Destroy not the work of God for the sake of food.\"[fn-37-P3749_1136961:33-nf] For it is the mark of a silly mind to be amazed and stupefied at what is presented at vulgar banquets, after the rich fare which is in the Word; and much sillier to make one's eyes the slaves of the delicacies, so that one's greed is, so to speak, carried round by the servants. And how foolish for people to raise themselves on the couches, all but pitching their faces into the dishes, stretching out from the couch as from a nest, according to the common saying, \"that they may catch the wandering steam by breathing it in!\" And how senseless, to besmear their hands with the condiments, and to be constantly reaching to the sauce, cramming themselves immoderately and shamelessly, not like people tasting, but ravenously seizing! For you may see such people, liker swine or dogs for gluttony than men, in such a hurry to feed themselves full, that both jaws are stuffed out at once, the veins about the face raised, and besides, the perspiration running all over, as they are tightened with their insatiable greed, and panting with their excess; the food pushed with unsocial eagerness into their stomach, as if they were stowing away their victuals for provision for a journey, not for digestion. Excess, which in all things is an evil, is very highly reprehensible in the matter of food. Gluttony, called o0yofagi/a, is nothing but excess in the use of relishes (o !yon); and laimargi/a is insanity with respect to the gullet; and gastrimargi/a is excess with respect to food-insanity in reference to the belly, as the name implies; for ma/rgoj is a madman. The apostle, checking those that transgress in their conduct at entertainments,[fn-37-P3750_1138624:34-nf] says: \"For every one taketh beforehand in eating his own supper; and one is hungry, and another drunken.

In short, we may see how great an evil in itself is envy, which cannot be other than malicious. Let us not look for other testimony. Cyprian himself is sufficient for us, through whose mouth the Lord poured forth so many thunders in most perfect truth, and uttered so many useful precepts about envy and malignity. Let us therefore read the letter of Cyprian about envy and malignity, and see how great an evil it is to envy those better than ourselves,-an evil whose origin he shows in memorable words to have sprung from the devil himself. \"To feel jealousy,\" he says, \"of what you regard as good, and to envy those who are better than yourselves, to some, dearest brethren, seems a light and minute offense.\"[fn-34-P3478_1974582:40-nf] And again a little later, when he was inquiring into the source and origin of the evil, he says, \"From this the devil, in the very beginning of the world, perished first himself, and led others to destruction.\"[fn-34-P3479_1974826:41-nf] And further on in the same chapter: \"What an evil, dearest brethren, is that by which an angel fell! by which that exalted and illustrious loftiness was able to be deceived and overthrown! by which he was deceived who was the deceiver! From that time envy stalks upon the earth, when man, about to perish through malignity, submits himself to the teacher of perdition,-when he who envies imitates the devil, as it is written, `Through envy of the devil came death into the world, and they that do hold of his side do find it.'\"[fn-34-P3480_1975369:42-nf] How true, how forcible are these words of Cyprian, in an epistle known throughout the world, we cannot fail to recognize. It was truly fitting for Cyprian to argue and warn most forcibly about envy and malignity, from which most deadly evil he proved his own heart to be so far removed by the abundance of his Christian love; by carefully guarding which he remained in the unity of communion with his colleagues, who without ill-feeling entertained different views about baptism, whilst he himself differed in opinion from them, not through any contention of ill will, but through human infirmity, erring in a point which God, in His own good time, would reveal to him by reason of his perseverance in love. For he says openly, \"Judging no one, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from us. For no one of us setteth himself up as a bishop of bishops, or by tyrannical terror forces his colleagues to a necessity of obeying.\"[fn-34-P3481_1976338:43-nf] And in the end of the epistle before us he says, \"These things I have written to you briefly, dearest brother, according to my poor ability, prescribing to or prejudging no one, so as to prevent each bishop from doing what he thinks right in the free exercise of his own judgment. We, so far as in us lies, do not strive on behalf of heretics with our colleges and fellow-bishops, with whom we hold the harmony that God enjoins, and the peace of our Lord, especially as the apostle says, `If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.'[fn-34-P3482_1976942:44-nf] Christian love in our souls, the honor of our fraternity, the bond of faith, the harmony of the priesthood, all these are maintained by us with patience and gentleness. For this cause we have also, so far as our poor ability admitted, by the permission and inspiration of the Lord, written now a treatise on the benefit of patience,[fn-34-P3483_1977295:45-nf] which we have sent to you in consideration of our mutual affection.\"[fn-34-P3484_1977452:46-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"198","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Further, Plato the philosopher says that the end is twofold: that which is communicable, and exists first in the ideal forms themselves, which he also calls\"the good; \"and that which partakes of it, and receives its likeness from it, as is the case in the men who appropriate virtue and true philosophy. Wherefore also Cleanthes, in the second book, On Pleasure, says that Socrates everywhere teaches that the just man and the happy are one and the same, and execrated the first man who separated the just from the useful, as having done an impious thing. For those are in truth impious who separate the useful from that which is tight according to the law. Plato himself says that happiness (eu0daimoni/a) is to possess rightly the daemon, and that the ruling faculty of the soul is called the daemon; and he terms happiness (eu0daimoni/a) the most perfect and complete good. Sometimes he calls it a consistent and harmonious life, sometimes the highest perfection in accordance with virtue; and this he places in the knowledge of the Good, and in likeness to God, demonstrating likeness to be justice and holiness with wisdom. For is it not thus that some of our writers have understood that man straightway on his creation received what is\"according to the image,\" but that what is according\"to the likeness\" he will receive afterwards on his perfection? Now Plato, teaching that the virtuous man shall have this likeness accompanied with humility, explains the following: \"He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\"[fn-60-P6077_1854965:259-nf] He says, accordingly, in The Laws: \"God indeed, as the ancient saying has it, occupying the beginning, the middle, and the end of all things, goes straight through while He goes round the circumference. And He is always attended by Justice, the avenger of those who revolt from the divine law.\" You see how he connects fear with the divine law. He adds, therefore: \"To which he, who would be happy, cleaving, will follow lowly and beautified.\" Then, connecting what follows these words, and admonishing by fear, he adds: \"What conduct, then, is dear and conformable to God? That which is characterized by one word of old date: Like will be dear to like, as to what is in proportion; but things out of proportion are neither dear to one another, nor to those which are in proportion. And that therefore he that would be dear to God, must, to the best of his power, become such as He is. And in virtue of the same reason, our self-controlling man is dear to God. But he that has no self-control is unlike and diverse.\" In saying that it was an ancient dogma, he indicates the teaching which had come to him from the law. And having in the Theataetus admitted that evils make the circuit of mortal nature and of this spot, he adds: \"Wherefore we must try to flee hence as soon as possible. For flight is likeness to God as far as possible. And likeness is to become holy and just with wisdom.\" Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, says that happiness is a perfect state in those who conduct themselves in accordance with nature, or the state of the good: for which condition all men have a desire, but the good only attained to quietude; consequently the virtues are the authors of happiness. And Xenocrates the Chalcedonian defines happiness to be the possession of virtue, strictly so called, and of the power subservient to it. Then he clearly says, that the seat in which it resides is the soul; that by which it is effected, the virtues; and that of these as parts are formed praiseworthy actions, good habits and dispositions, and motions, and relations; and that corporeal and external objects are not without these. For Polemo, the disciple of Xenocrates, seems of the opinion that happiness is sufficiency of all good things, or of the most and greatest. He lays down the doctrine, then, that happiness never exists without virtue; and that virtue, apart from corporeal and external objects, is sufficient for happiness. Let these things be so. The contradictions to the opinions specified shall be adduced in due time. But on us it is incumbent to reach the unaccomplished end, obeying the commands-that is, God-and living according to them, irreproachably and intelligently, through knowledge of the divine will; and assimilation as far as possible in accordance with right reason is the end, and restoration to perfect adoption by the Son, which ever glorifies the Father by the great High Priest who has deigned to call us brethren and fellow-heirs. And the apostle, succinctly describing the end, writes in the Epistle to the Romans: \"But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\"[fn-60-P6078_1858156:260-nf] And viewing the hope as twofold-that which is expected, and that which has been received-he now teaches the end to be the restitution of the hope.\"For patience,\" he says, \"worketh experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that is given to us.\"[fn-60-P6079_1858512:261-nf] On account of which love and the restoration to hope, he says, in another place, \"which rest is laid up for us.\"[fn-60-P6080_1858646:262-nf] You will find in Ezekiel the like, as follows: \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die. And the man who shall be righteous, and shall do judgment and justice, who has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, and hath not approached to a woman in the time of her uncleanness (for he does not wish the seed of man to be dishonoured), and will not injure a man; will restore the debtor's pledge, and will not take usury; will turn away his hand from wrong; will do true judgment between a man and his neighbour; will walk in my ordinances, and keep my commandments, so as to do the truth; he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith Adonai the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6081_1859410:263-nf] Isaiah too, in exhorting him that hath not believed to gravity of life, and the Gnostic to attention, proving that man's virtue and God's are not the same, speaks thus: \"Seek the Lord, and on finding Him call on Him. And when He shall draw near to you, let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his ways; and let him return to the Lord, and he shall obtain mercy,\" down to \"and your thoughts from my thoughts.\"[fn-60-P6082_1859862:264-nf] \"We,\" then, according to the noble apostle, \"wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.\"[fn-60-P6083_1860086:265-nf] And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope,\" down to \"made an high priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.\"[fn-60-P6084_1860276:266-nf] Similarly with Paul \"the All-virtuous Wisdom\" says, \"He, that heareth me shall dwell trusting in hope.\"[fn-60-P6085_1860403:267-nf] For the restoration of hope is called by the same term \"hope.\" To the expression \"will dwell\" it has most beautifully added\" trusting,\" showing that such an one has obtained rest, having received the hope for which he hoped. Wherefore also it is added, \"and shall be quiet, without fear of any evil.\" And openly and expressly the apostle, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians says, \"Be ye followers of me, as also I am of Christ,\"[fn-60-P6086_1860857:268-nf] in order that that may take place. If ye are of me, and I am of Christ, then ye are imitators of Christ, and Christ of God. Assimilation to God, then, so that as far as possible a man becomes righteous and holy with wisdomhe lays down as the aim of faith, and the end to be that restitution of the promise which is effected by faith. From these doctrines gush the fountains, which we specified above, of those who have dogmatized about \"the end.\" But of these enough.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":11,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_30_part_i_introduction_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Now the place where they say the cup was broken, was not a Church; there was no Presbyter in occupation of the place; and the day on which they say that Macarius did the deed, was not the Lord's day.

And the man who is in this condition, cannot praise the Lord, according to the saying of the prophet which tells us: \"The dead cannot praise Thee, O Lord; neither all they that go down into the grave (doubtless of sin).

For the Lord would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At least we must avoid, and shunwith the utmost horror, that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ could be found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into hell, thus punctuate \"Verily, I say unto you to-day,\" and making a stop apply \"thou shall be with.

And indeed to put aside for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and likeness of God consists,[fn-35-P3567_1331546:39-nf] will, when the burden of the body with which it is oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh sensible, by participation with it: especially when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that when the mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it will restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a purer and finer condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:\" and therefore \"we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.

Wherefore, as the apostle said of the law, \"The law is good, if a man use it lawfully,\"[fn-36-P3658_2049499:8-nf] so we may fairly say of baptism, Baptism is good, if a man use it lawfully. And as they who used the law unlawfully could not in that case cause that it should not be in itself good, or make it null and void, so any one who uses baptism unlawfully, either because he lives in heresy, or because he lives the worst of lives, yet cannot cause that the baptism should be otherwise than good, or altogether null and void. And so, when he is converted either to Catholic unity, or to a mode of living worthy of so great a sacrament, he begins to have not another and a lawful baptism, but that same baptism in a lawful manner. Nor does the remission of irrevocable sins follow on baptism, unless a man not only have lawful baptism, but have it lawfully; and yet it does not follow that if a man have it not lawfully, so that his sins are either not remitted, or, being remitted, are brought on him again, therefore the sacrament of baptism should be in the baptized person either bad or null and void.

Wretched men indeed! who wish to be pseudo-prophets, forsooth, but who set aside the gift of prophecy from the Church; acting like those (the Encratitae)[fn-75-P7521_2022273:156-nf] who, on account of such as come in hypocrisy, hold themselves aloof from the communion of the brethren.

Indeed, they have arrived at such a pitch of audacity, as to entitle their comparatively recent writing \"the Gospel of Truth,\" though it agrees in nothing with the Gospels of the Apostles, so that they have really no Gospel which is not full of blasphemy. For if what they have published is the Gospel of truth, and yet is totally unlike those which have been handed down to us from the apostles, any who please may learn, as is shown from the Scriptures themselves, that that which has been handed down from the apostles can no longer be reckoned the Gospel of truth. But that these Gospels alone are true and reliable, and admit neither an increase nor diminution of the aforesaid number, I have proved by so many and such [arguments]. For, since God made all things in due proportion and adaptation, it was fit also that the outward aspect of the Gospel should be well arranged and harmonized.

And we admit that the same nature exists in every race, and the same virtue. As far as respects human nature, the woman does not possess one nature, and the man exhibit another, but the same: so also with virtue. If, consequently, a self-restraint and righteousness, and whatever qualities are regarded as following them, is the virtue of the male, it belongs to the male alone to be virtuous, and to the woman to be licentious and unjust. But it is offensive even to say this. Accordingly woman is to practise self-restraint and righteousness, and every other virtue, as well as man, both bond and free; since it is a fit consequence that the same nature possesses one and the same virtue.[fn-67-P6797_2066800:91-nf] We do not say that woman's nature is the same as man's, as she is woman. For undoubtedly it stands to reason that some difference should exist between each of them, in virtue of which one is male and the other female. Pregnancy and parturition, accordingly, we say belong to woman, as she is woman, and not as she is a human being. But if there were no difference between man and woman, both would do and suffer the same things. As then there is sameness, as far as respects the soul, she will attain to the same virtue; but as there is difference as respects the peculiar construction of the body, she is destined for child-bearing and housekeeping. \"For I would have you know,\" says the apostle, \"that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man: for the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. For neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.\"[fn-67-P6798_2067877:92-nf] For as we say that the man ought to be continent, and superior to pleasures; so also we reckon that the woman should be continent and practised in fighting against pleasures. \"But I say, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh,\" counsels the apostolic command; \"for the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. These, then, are contrary\" (not as good to evil, but as fighting advantageously), he adds therefore, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornication uncleanness, profligacy, idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, strifes, jealousies, wrath, contentions, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I tell you before, as I have also said before, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, temperance, goodness, faith, meekness.\"[fn-67-P6799_2068894:93-nf] He calls sinners, as I think, \"flesh,\" and the righteous \"spirit.\" Further, manliness is to be assumed in order to produce confidence and forbearance, so as \"to him that strikes on the one cheek, to give to him the other; and to him that takes away the cloak, to yield to him the coat also,\" strongly, restraining anger. For we do not train our women like Amazons to manliness in war; since we wish the men even to be peaceable. I hear that the Sarmatian women practise war no less than the men; and the women of the Sacae besides, who shoot backwards, feigning flight as well as the men. I am aware, too, that the women near Iberia practise manly work and toil, not refraining from their tasks even though near their delivery; but even in the very struggle of her pains, the woman, on being delivered, taking up the infant, carries it home. Further, the females no less than the males manage the house, and hunt, and keep the flocks:-","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":11,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"136","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The ruling power is therefore the head.

Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the Church; and He is the Saviour of the body. Husbands, love your wives, as also Christ loved the Church. So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh.\"[fn-68-P6810_2071419:96-nf] And in that to the Colossians it is said, \"Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord.[fn-68-P6811_2071552:97-nf] Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well pleasing to the Lord. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. Servants, be obedient in all things to those who are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but with singleness of heart, fearing the Lord. And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as serving the Lord and not men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer shall receive the Wrong, which he hath done; and there is no respect of persons. Masters, render to your servants justice and equity; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free: but Christ is all, and in all.\"[fn-68-P6812_2072754:98-nf] And the earthly Church is the image of the heavenly, as we pray also \"that the will of God may be done upon the earth as in heaven.\"[fn-68-P6813_2072925:99-nf] \"Putting on, therefore, bowels of mercy, gentleness, humbleness, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if one have a quarrel against any man; as also Christ hath forgiven us, so also let us. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which ye are called in one body; and be thankful.\"[fn-68-P6814_2073352:100-nf] For there is no obstacle to adducing frequently the same Scripture in order to put Marcion[fn-68-P6815_2073621:101-nf] to the blush, if perchance he be persuaded and converted; by learning that the faithful ought to be grateful to God the Creator, who hath called us, and who preached the Gospel in the body. From these considerations the unity of the faith is clear, and it is shown who is the perfect man; so that though some are reluctant, and offer as much resistance as they can, though menaced with punishments at the hand of husband or master, both the domestic and the wife will philosophize. Moreover, the free, though threatened with death at a tyrant's hands, and brought before the tribunals, and all his substances imperilled, will by no means abandon piety; nor will the wife who dwells with a wicked husband, or the son if he has a bad father, or the domestic if he has a bad master, ever fail in holding nobly to virtue. But as it is noble for a man to die for virtue, and for liberty, and for himself, so also is it for a woman. For this is not peculiar to the nature of males, but to the nature of the good. Accordingly, both the old man, the young, and the servant will live faithfully, and if need be die; which will be to be made alive by death. So we know that both children, and women, and servants have often, against their fathers', and masters', and husbands' will, reached the highest degree of excellence. Wherefore those who are determined to live piously ought none the less to exhibit alacrity, when some seem to exercise compulsion on them; but much more, I think, does it become them to show eagerness, and to strive with uncommon vigour, lest, being overcome, they abandon the best and most indispensable counsels. For it does not, I think, admit of comparison, whether it be better to be a follower of the Almighty than to choose the darkness of demons. For the things which are done by us on account of others we are to do always, endeavouring to have respect to those for whose sake it is proper that they be done, regarding the gratification rendered in their case, as what is to be our rule; but the things which are done for our own sake rather than that of others, are to be done with equal earnestness, whether they are like to please certain people or not. If some indifferent things have obtained such honour as to appear worthy of adoption, though against the will of some; much more is virtue to be regarded by us as worth contending for, looking the while to nothing but what can be rightly done, whether it seem good to others or not. Well then, Epicurus, writing to Menoeceus, says, \"Let not him who is young delay philosophizing, and let not the old man grow weary of philosophizing; for no one is either not of age or past age for attending to the health of his soul. And he who says that the time for philosophizing is not come or is past, is like the man who says that the time for happiness is not come or has gone. So that young[fn-68-P6816_2076523:102-nf] as well as old ought to philosophize: the one, in order that, while growing old, he may grow young in good things out of favour accruing from what is past; and the other, that he may be at once young and old, from want of fear for the future.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":11,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_34_de_decretis_or_defence_of_the_nicene_definition","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"20. Again, when the Bishops said that the Word must be described as the True Power t and Image of the Father, in all things exact[fn-33-P3378_1336430:146-nf] and like the Father, and as unalterable, e and as always, and as in Him without division (for never was the Word not, but He was always, existing everlastingly with the Father, as the radiance of light), Eusebius and his fellows endured indeed, as not daring to contradict, being put to shame by the arguments which were urged against them; but withal they were caught whispering to each other and winking with their eyes, that `like,' and `always,' and `power,' and `in Him,' were, as before, common to us and the Son, and that it was no difficulty to agree to these. As to `like,' they said that it is written of us, `Man is the image and glory of God[fn-33-P3379_1337105:147-nf] :' `always,' that it was written, `For we which live are alway[fn-33-P3380_1337189:148-nf] :' `in Him,' `In Him we live and move and have our being[fn-33-P3381_1337268:149-nf] :'`unalterable,' that it is written, `Nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ[fn-33-P3382_1337378:150-nf] :' as to `power,' that the caterpillar and the locust are called `power' and `great power[fn-33-P3383_1337509:151-nf] ,' and that it is often said of the people, for instance, `All the power of the Lord came out of the land of Egypt[fn-33-P3384_1337644:152-nf] :' and there are others also, heavenly ones, for Scripture says, `The Lord of powers is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge[fn-33-P3385_1337792:153-nf] .' Indeed Asterius, by title the sophist, had said the like in writing, having learned it from them, and before him Arius[fn-33-P3386_1337934:154-nf] having learned it also, as has been said. But the Bishops discerning in this too their dissimulation, and whereas it is written, `Deceit is in the heart of the irreligious that imagine evil[fn-33-P3387_1338154:155-nf] ,' were again compelled on their part to collect the sense of the Scriptures, and to re-say and re-write what they had said before, more distinctly still, namely, that the Son is `one in essence[fn-33-P3388_1338371:156-nf] ' with the Father: by way of signifying, that the Son was from the Father, and not merely like, but the same in likeness[fn-33-P3389_1339525:157-nf] , and of shewing that the Son's likeness and unalterableness was different from such copy of the same as is ascribed to us, which we acquire from virtue on the ground of observance of the commandments. For bodies which are like each other may be separated and become at distances from each other, as are human sons relatively to their parents (as it is written concerning Adam and Seth, who was begotten of him that he was like him after his own pattern[fn-33-P3390_1341177:158-nf] ); but since the generation of the Son from the Father is not according to the nature of men, and not only like, but also inseparable from the essence of the Father, and He and the Father are one, as He has said Himself, and the Word is ever in the Father and the Father in the Word, as the radiance stands towards the light (for this the phrase itself indicates), therefore the Council, as understanding this, suitably wrote `one in essence,' that they might both defeat the perverseness of the heretics, and shew that the Word was other than originated things. For, after thus writing, they at once added, `But they who say that the Son of God is from nothing, or created, or alterable, or a work, or from other essence, these the Holy Catholic Church anathematizes[fn-33-P3391_1341963:159-nf] .' And by saying this, they shewed clearly that `of the essence,' and `one in essence,' are destructive of those catchwords of irreligion, such as `created,' and `work,' and `originated,' and `alterable,' and `He was not before His generation.' And he who holds these, contradicts the Council; but he who does not hold with Arius, must needs hold and intend the decisions of the Council, suitably regarding them to signify the relation of the radiance to the light, and from thence gaining the illustration of the truth.","title":"De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":11,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":48,"source_paragraph":"262","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"110. Augustin answered: This psalm speaks of those who receive baptism aright, and use as holy what is so holy. For those words have no reference even to Simon Magus, who yet received the same holy baptism; and because he would not use it in a holy way, he did not therefore pollute it, or show that in such cases it should be repeated. But since you have made mention of Goliath. listen to the psalm which treats of Goliath himself, and see that he is portrayed in a new song; for there it is said, \"I will sing a new song unto Thee, O God: upon a psaltery, and an instrument, of ten strings, will I sing praise unto Thee.\"[fn-50-P5084_2485736:162-nf] And see whether he belongs to this song who refuses to communicate with the whole earth. For elsewhere it is said, \"O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.\"[fn-50-P5085_2485942:163-nf] Therefore the whole earth, with whom you are not in unity, sings the new song. And these too are the words of the whole earth, \"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want,\" etc. These are not the words of the tares, though they be endured until the harvest in the same crop. They are not the words of the chaff, but of the wheat, although they are nourished by one and the same rain, and are threshed out on the same threshing-floor at the same time, till they shall be separated the one from the other by the winnowing at the last day. And yet these both assuredly have the same baptism, though they are not the same themselves. But if your party also were the Church of God, you would certainly confess that this psalm has no application to the infuriated bands of the Circumcelliones. Or if they too themselves are led through the paths of righteousness, why do you deny that they are your associates, when you are reproached with them, although, for the most part, you console yourselves for the scantiness of your section, not by the rod and staff of the Lord, but by the cudgels of the Circumcelliones, with which you think that you are safe even against the Roman laws,-to bring oneself into collision with which is surely nothing less than to walk through the valley of the shadow of death? But he with whom the Lord is, fears no evils. Surely, however, you will not venture to say that the words which are sung in this song belong even to those infuriated men, and yet you not only acknowledge, but ostentatiously set forth the fact that they have baptism. These words, therefore, are not used by any who are not refreshed by the holy water, as are all the righteous men of God; not by those who are brought to destruction by using it, as was that magician when baptized by Philip: and yet the water itself in both kinds of men is the same, and of the same degree of sanctity. These words are not used except by those who will belong to the right hand; but yet both sheep and goats feed in the same pasture under one Shepherd, until they shall be separated, that they may receive their due reward. These words are not used except by those who, like Peter, receive life from the table of the Lord, not judgment, as did Judas; and yet the supper was itself the same to both, but it was not of the same profit to both, because they were not one. These words are not used except by those who, by being anointed with the sacred oil, are blessed in spirit also, as was David; not merely consecrated in the body only, as was Saul: and yet, as they had both received the same outward sign, it was not the sacrament, but the personal merit that was different in the two cases. These words are not used except by those who, with converted heart, receive the cup of the Lord unto eternal life; not by those who eat and drink damnation to themselves, as the apostle says:[fn-50-P5086_2488831:164-nf] and yet, though they are not one, the cup which they receive is one, exerting its power on the martyrs that they should obtain a heavenly reward, not on the Circumcelliones, that they should mark precipices with death. Remember, therefore, that the characters of bad men in no wise interfere with the virtue of the sacraments, so that their holiness should either be destroyed, or even diminished; but that they injure the unrighteous men themselves, that they should have them as witnesses of their damnation, not as aids to health. For beyond all doubt you should have taken into consideration the actual concluding words of this psalm, and have understood that, on account of those who forsake the faith after they have been baptized, it cannot be said by all who receive holy baptism that \"I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever:\" and yet, whether they abide in the faith, or whether they have fallen away, though they themselves are not one, their baptism is one, and though they themselves are not both holy, yet the baptism in both is holy; because even apostates, if they return, are not baptized as though they had lost the sacrament, but undergo humiliation, because they have done a despite to it which remains in them.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":73,"source_paragraph":"343","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"166.

The things which I speak relate neither to the pleasure of the ears, nor to the eyes, nor to the smell, nor to the taste, nor to the touch; by the mind alone are they received, by the understanding alone are they drawn up: that understanding is not with thee, how canst thou apprehend what I am saying? `Call thy husband,' bring thy understanding forward. What is it for thee to have a soul? It is not much, for a beast has a soul. Wherein art thou better than the beast? In having understanding, which the beast has not.\" Then what is \"Call thy husband\"? \"Thou dost not apprehend me, thou dost not understand me: I am speaking to thee of the gift of God, and thy thought is of the flesh; thou wishest not to thirst in a carnal sense, I am addressing myself to the spirit: thy understanding is absent. `Call thy husband.' Be not as the horse and mule, which have no understanding.\" Therefore, my brethren, to have a soul, and not to have understanding, that is, not to use it, not to live according to it, is a beast's life. For we have somewhat in common with the beasts, that by which we live in the flesh, but it must be ruled by the understanding. For the motions of the soul, which moves after the flesh, and longs to run unrestrainedly loose after carnal delights, are ruled over by the understanding. Which is to be called the husband?-that which rules, or that which is ruled? Without doubt, when the life is well ordered the understanding rules the soul, for itself belongs to the soul. For the understanding is not something other than the soul, but a thing of the soul: as the eye is not something other than the flesh, but a thing of the flesh. But whilst the eye is a thing of the flesh, yet it alone enjoys the light; and the other fleshy members may be steeped in light, but they cannot feel the light: the eye alone is both bathed in it, and enjoys it. Thus in our soul there is a something called the understanding. This something of the soul, which is called understanding and mind, is enlightened by the higher light. Now that higher light, by which the human mind is enlightened, is God; for \"that was the true light which enlighteneth every man coming into this world.\" Such a light was Christ, such a light was speaking with the woman yet she was not present with the understanding, to have it enlightened with that light; not merely to have it shed upon it, but to enjoy it. Therefore the Lord said, \"Call thy husband,\" as if He were to say, I wish to enlighten, and yet there is not here whom I may enlighten: bring hither the understanding through which thou mayest be taught, by which thou mayest be ruled. Thus, put the soul without the understanding for the woman; and having the understanding as having the husband. But this husband does not rule the wife well, except when he is ruled by a higher. \"For the head of the woman is the man, but the head of the man is Christ.\"[fn-8-P877_482799:10-nf] The head of the man was talking with the woman, and the man was not present. And so the Lord, as if He said, Bring hither thy head, that he may receive his head, says, \"Call thy husband, and come hither;\" that is, Be here, be present: for thou art as absent, while thou understandest not the voice of the Truth here present; be thou present here, but not alone; be thou here with thy husband.","title":"Tractate XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_64_xiv_the_first_conference_of_abbot_nesteros_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But to return to the explanation of the knowledge from which our discourse took its rise. Thus, as we said above, practical knowledge is distributed among many subjects and interests, but theoretical is divided into two parts, i.e., the historical interpretation and the spiritual sense. Whence also Solomon when he had summed up the manifold grace of the Church, added: \"for all who are with her are clothed with double garments.\"[fn-54-P5478_1960098:8-nf] But of spiritual knowledge there are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical,[fn-54-P5479_1960213:9-nf] of which we read as follows in Proverbs: \"But do you describe these things to yourself in three ways according to the largeness of your heart.\"[fn-54-P5480_1961149:10-nf] And so the history embraces the knowledge of things past and visible, as it is repeated in this way by the Apostle: \"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he who was of the free was by promise.\" But to the allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to have prefigured the form of some mystery \"For these,\" says he, \"are the two covenants the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth into bondage, which is Agar. For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is compared to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.\" But the anagogical sense rises from spiritual mysteries even to still more sublime and sacred secrets of heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in these words: \"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate more than of her that hath an husband.\"[fn-54-P5481_1962255:11-nf] The tropological sense is the moral explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: \"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.\"[fn-54-P5482_1962637:12-nf] And so these four previously mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses: historically as the city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of Christ, anagogically as the heavenly city of God \"which is the mother of us all,\" tropologically, as the soul of man, which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title. Of these four kinds of interpretation the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by doctrine?\"[fn-54-P5483_1963322:13-nf] For \"revelation\" belongs to allegory whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is revealed in its spiritual sense and interpretation, as for instance if we tried to expound how \"all our fathers were under the cloud and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea,\" and how they \"all ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ.\"[fn-54-P5484_1963776:14-nf] And this explanation where there is a comparison of the figure of the body and blood of Christ which we receive daily, contains the allegorical sense. But the knowledge, which is in the same way mentioned by the Apostle, is tropological, as by it we can by a careful study see of all things that have to do with practical discernment whether they are useful and good, as in this case, when we are told to judge of our own selves \"whether it is fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered.\"[fn-54-P5485_1964301:15-nf] And this system, as has been said, contains the moral meaning. So \"prophecy\" which the Apostle puts in the third place, alludes to the anagogical sense by which the words are applied to things future and invisible, as here: \"But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those that sleep: that ye be not sorry as others also who have no hope. For if we believe that Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say to you by the word of God, that we which are alive at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent those that sleep in Christ, for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.\"[fn-54-P5486_1965091:16-nf] In which kind of exhortation the figure of anagoge is brought forward. But \"doctrine\" unfolds the simple course of historical exposition, under which is contained no more secret sense, but what is declared by the very words: as in this passage: \"For I delivered unto you first of all what I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again on the third day, and that he was seen of Cephas;\"[fn-54-P5487_1965583:17-nf] and: \"God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;\"[fn-54-P5488_1965706:18-nf] or this: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord the God is one Lord.\"[fn-54-P5489_1965783:19-nf] ","title":"XIV.

And the Lord said unto him, \"Because I said, When thou wast under the fig-tree I saw thee, believest thou? thou shall see greater things than these.\" What are these \"greater things\"? \"Verily I say unto you\" (for he \"is an Israelite in whom is no guile;\" remember Jacob in whom was no guile; and recollect of what he is speaking, the stone at his head, the vision in his sleep, the ladder from earth to heaven, the Angels ascending and descending; and so see what it is that the Lord would say to \"the Israelite without guile\"); \"Verily I say unto you, Ye shall see heaven opened\" (hear, thou guileless Nathanael, what guileless Jacob saw); \"ye shall see heaven opened, and Angels ascending and descending\" (unto whom?) \"unto the Son of Man.\" Therefore was He, as the Son of Man, anointed on the head; for \"the head of the woman is the man, and the Head of the man is Christ.\"[fn-48-P4814_2067035:31-nf] Now observe, He did not say, \"ascending from the Son of Man, and descending to the Son of Man,\" as if He were only above; but \"ascending and descending unto the Son of Man.\" Hear the Son of Man crying out from above, \"Saul, Saul.\" Hear the Son of Man from below, \"Why persecutest thou Me?\"[fn-48-P4815_2067344:32-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXXIX.

The Lord our God then reveals it, and by His Scriptures puts us in mind how it may be understood when judgment is spoken of. I exhort you, therefore, to give attention. Sometimes judgment means punishment, sometimes it means discrimination. According to that mode of speech in which judgment means discrimination, \"we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ that\" a man \"may there receive what things he has done in the body, whether it be good or ill.\" For this same is a discrimination, to distribute good things to the good, evil things to the evil. For if judgment were always to be taken in a bad sense, the psalm would not say, \"Judge me, O God.\" Perhaps some one is surprised when he hears one say, \"Judge me, O God.\" For man is wont to say, \"Forgive me, O God;\" \"Spare me, O God.\" Who is it that says, \"Judge me, O God\"? Sometimes in the psalm this very verse even is placed in the pause,[fn-11-P1130_690561:4-nf] to be given out by the reader and responded by the people. Does it not perhaps strike some man's heart so much that he is afraid to sing and to say to God, \"Judge me, O God\"? And yet the people sing it with confidence, and do not imagine that they wish an evil thing in that which they have learned from the divine word; even if they do not well understand it, they believe that what they sing is something good. And yet even the psalm itself has not left a man without an insight into the meaning of it. For, going on, it shows in the words that follow what kind of judgment it spoke of; that it is not one of condemnation, but of discrimination. For saith it, \"Judge me, O God.\" What means \"Judge me, O God, and discern my cause from an unholy nation\"? According to this judgment of discerning, then, \"we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ.\" But again, according to the judgment of condemnation, \"Whoso heareth my words,\" saith He, \"and believeth Him that sent me, hath eternal life, and shall not come into judgment, but makes a passage from death to life.\" What is \"shall not come into judgment?\" Shall not come into condemnation. Let us prove from the Scriptures that judgment is put where punishment is understood; although also in this very passage, a little further on, you will hear the same term judgment put for nothing else than for condemnation and punishment. Yet the apostle says in a certain place, writing to those who abused the body, what the faithful among you know; and because they abused it, they were chastised by the scourge of the Lord. For he says to them, \"Many among you are weak and sickly, and deeply sleep.\" For many therefore even died. And he went on: \"For if we judged ourselves, we should not be judged by the Lord;\" that is, if we reproved ourselves, we should not be reproved by the Lord. \"But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.\"[fn-11-P1131_692519:5-nf] There are therefore those who are judged here according to punishment, that they may be spared there; there are those who are spared here, that they may be the more abundantly tormented there; and there are those to whom the very punishments are meted out without the scourge of punishment, if they be not corrected by the scourge of God; that, since here they have despised the Father that scourgeth, they may there feel the Judge that punisheth. Therefore there is a judgment into which God, that is, the Son of God, will in the end send the devil and his angels, and all the unbelieving and ungodly with him. To this judgment, he who, now believing, passes from death unto life, shall not come.","title":"Tractate XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_31_tractate_xxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"11. \"I am,\" saith He, \"the bread of life.\" And what was the source of their pride? \"Your fathers,\" saith He, \"did eat manha in the wilderness, and are dead.\" What is it whereof ye are proud? \"They ate manna, and are dead.\" Why they ate and are dead? Because they believed that which they saw; what they saw not, they did not understand. Therefore were they \"your\" fathers, because you are like them. For so far, my brethren, as relates to this visible corporeal death, do not we too die who eat the bread that cometh down from heaven? They died just as we shall die, so far, as I said, as relates to the visible and carnal death of this body. But so far as relates to that death, concerning which the Lord warns us by fear, and in which their fathers died: Moses ate manna, Aaron ate manna, Phinehas ate manna, and many ate manna, who were pleasing to the Lord, and they are not dead. Why? Because they understood the visible food spiritually, hungered spiritually, tasted spiritually, that they might be filled spiritually. For even we at this day receive visible food: but the sacrament is one thing, the virtue of the sacrament another. How many do receive at the altar and die, and die indeed by receiving? Whence the apostle saith, \"Eateth and drinketh judgment to himself.\"[fn-12-P1288_814324:16-nf] For it was not the mouthful given by the Lord that was the poison to Judas.

Before ye approach the altar, consider well what ye are to say: \"Forgive us our debts, even as we forgive our debtors.\"[fn-12-P1289_814879:17-nf] Thou forgivest, it shall be forgiven thee: approach in peace, it is bread, not poison. But see whether thou forgivest; for if thou dost not forgive, thou liest, and liest to Him whom thou canst not deceive. Thou canst lie to God, but thou canst not deceive God. He knows what thou doest. He sees thee within, examines thee within, inspects within, judges within, and within He either condemns or crowns. But the fathers of these Jews were evil fathers of evil sons, unbelieving fathers of unbelieving sons, murmuring fathers of murmurers. For in no other thing is that people said to have offended the Lord more than in murmuring against God. And for that reason, the Lord, willing to show those men to be the children of such murmurers, thus begins His address to them: \"Why murmur ye among yourselves,\" ye murmurers, children of murmurers?

Are not men who even conceive such thoughts, more than insensate? For if for us the Word was made, He has not precedence[fn-60-P6028_2403622:185-nf] of us with God; for He did not take counsel about us having Him within Him, but having us in Himself, counselled, as they say, concerning His own Word. But if so, perchance the Father had not even a will for the Son at all; for not as having a will for Him, did He create Him, but with a will for us, He formed Him for our sake; for He designed Him after designing usso that, according to these irreligious men, henceforth the Son, who was made as an instrument, is superfluous, now that they are made for whom He was created. But if the Son alone was made by God alone, because He could endure it, but we, because we could not, were made by the Word, why does He not first take counsel about the Word, who could endure His making, instead of taking counsel about us? or why does He not make more of Him who was strong, than of us who were weak? or why making Him first, does He not counsel about Him first? or why counselling about us first, does He not make us first, His will being sufficient for the constitution of all things?

And they wished to set down in writing the acknowledged language of Scripture, namely that the Word is of God by nature Only-begotten, Power, Wisdom of the Father, Very God, as John says, and as Paul wrote, brightness of the Father's glory and express image of His person[fn-78-P7861_3148329:22-nf] .

But the Bishops, beholding their craftiness, and the cunning of their impiety, expressed more plainly the sense of the words `of God,' by writing that the Son is of the Essence of God, so that whereas the Creatures, since they do not exist of themselves without a cause, but have a beginning of their existence, are said to be `of God,' the Son alone might be deemed proper to the Essence of the Father. For this is peculiar to one who is Only-begotten and true Word in relation to a Father, and this was the reason why the words `of the essence' were adopted. Again[fn-78-P7865_3149446:26-nf] , upon the bishops asking the dissembling minority if they agreed that the Son was not a Creature, but the Power and only Wisdom of the Father, and the Eternal Image, in all respects exact, of the Father, and true God, Eusebius and his fellows were observed exchanging nods with one another, as much as to say `this applies to us men also, for we too are called \"the image and glory of God[fn-78-P7866_3149869:27-nf] ,\" and of us it is said, \"For we which live are alway[fn-78-P7867_3149942:28-nf] ,\" and there are many Powers, and \"all the power[fn-78-P7868_3150046:29-nf] of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt,\" while the caterpillar and the locust are called His \"great power[fn-78-P7869_3150182:30-nf] .\" And \"the Lord of powers[fn-78-P7870_3150227:31-nf] is with us, the God of Jacob is our help.\" For we hold that we are proper[fn-78-P7871_3150329:32-nf] to God, and not merely so, but insomuch that He has even called us brethren.

It was not then that he perished, but he was already a thief, and a reprobate, when following the Lord; for it was with his body and not with his heart that he followed. He made up the apostolic number of twelve, but had no part in the apostolic blessedness: he had been made the twelfth in semblance, and on his departure, and the succession of another, the apostolic reality was completed, and the entireness of the number conserved.[fn-22-P2203_1353903:14-nf] What lesson then, my brethren, did our Lord Jesus Christ wish to impress on His Church, when it pleased Him to have one castaway among the twelve, but this, that we should bear with the wicked, and refrain from dividing the body of Christ?

Of one bread did both Peter and Judas partake, and yet what communion had the believer with the infidel? Peter's partaking was unto life, but that of Judas unto death.

But we shall be able, with His help, to handle what is in need of more elaborate handling, if we linger not at what is perfectly clear. Accordingly, after uttering these words, the Lord added, \"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but, that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel upon me.\" And what is this, but that he shall trample upon me?We know of whom He speaks: it is Judas, that betrayer of His, who is referred to.

He speaketh not so of them all; for He knows whom He has chosen to be associated with Himself in blessedness. Of such he is not one, who ate His bread in order that he might lift up his heel upon Him. The bread they ate was the Lord Himself; he ate the Lord's bread in enmity to the Lord: they ate life, and he punishment. \"For he that eateth unworthily,\" says the apostle, \"eateth judgment unto himself.\"[fn-24-P2490_1482922:2-nf] \"From this time,\"[fn-24-P2491_1482958:3-nf] Christ adds, \"I tell you before it come; that when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am He:\" that is, I am He of whom the Scripture that preceded has just said, \"He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel upon me.\"","title":"Tractate LIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_67_tractate_lxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. I Know, dearly beloved, that some may be moved, as the godly to inquire into the meaning of, and the ungodly to find fault with, the statement, that it was after the Lord had given the bread, that had been dipped, to His betrayer that Satan entered into him. For so it is written: \"And when He had dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the Son of Simon. And after the bread, then entered Satan into him.\" For they say, Was this the worth of Christ's bread, given from Christ's own table, that after it Satan should enter into His disciple? And the answer we give them is, that thereby we are taught rather how much we need to beware of receiving. what is good in a sinful spirit. For the point of special importance is, not the thing that is received, but the person that receives it; and not the character of the thing that is given, but of him to whom it is given. For even good things are hurtful, and evil things are beneficial, according to the character of the recipients. \"Sin,\" says the apostle, \"that it might appear sin, wrought death to me by that which is good.\"[fn-25-P2543_1505493:1-nf] Thus, you see, evil is brought about by the good, so long as that which is good is wrongly received. It is he also that says: \"Lest I should be exalted unduly through the greatness of my revelations, there was given to me a thorn in my flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me. For which thing I besought the Lord thrice, that He would take it away from me; and He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-25-P2544_1505967:2-nf] And here, you see, good was brought about by that which was evil, when the evil was received in a good spirit. Why, then, do we wonder if Christ's bread was given to Judas, that thereby he should be made over to the devil; when we see, on the other hand, that Paul was visited by a messenger of the devil, that by such an instrumentality he might be perfected in Christ? In this way, both the good was injurious to the evil man, and the evil was beneficial to the good. Bear in mind the meaning of the Scripture, \"Whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.\"[fn-25-P2545_1506625:3-nf] And when the apostle said this, he was dealing with those who were taking the body of the Lord, like any other food, in an undiscerning and careless spirit. If, then, he is thus taken to task who does not discern, that is, does not distinguish from the other kinds of food, the body of the Lord, what condemnation must be his, who in the guise of a friend comes as an enemy to His table! If negligence in the guest is thus visited with blame, what must be the punishment that will fall on the man that sells the very person who has invited him to his table!

On hearing these matters, those who were present gave great glory to God, and ascribed to Him such praise as it is meet for Him to receive. And on Archelaus himself they bestowed many tokens of honour. Then Marcellus rose up; and casting off his cloak.[fn-36-P3682_1029750:405-nf] he threw his arms round Archelaus, and kissed him, and embraced him, and clung to him.

But when Archelaus observed this, he raised his voice like a trumpet above the din, in his anxiety to restrain the multitude, and addressed them thus: \"Stop, my beloved brethren, lest mayhap we be found to have the guilt of blood on us at the day of judgment; for it is written of men like this, that 'there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.'\"[fn-36-P3684_1030628:407-nf] And when he had uttered these words, the crowds of people were quieted again.[fn-36-P3685_1030728:408-nf] -Now, because it was the pleasure of Marcellus that this disputation should have a place given it,[fn-36-P3686_1030999:409-nf] and that it should also be described, I could not gainsay his wish, but trusted to the kind consideration of the readers, believing that they would pardon me if my discourse should sound somewhat inartistic or boorish: for the great thing which we have had in view has been, that the means of knowing what took place on this occasion should not fail to be brought within the reach of all who desired to understand the subject. Thereafter, it must be added, when Manes had once taken to flight, he made his appearance nowhere there again. His attendant Turbo, however, was handed over by Marcellus to Archelaus; and on Archelaus ordaining him as a deacon, he remained in the suite of Marcellus. But Manes in his flight came to a certain village which was at a considerable distance from the city, and bore the name of Diodorus. Now in that place there was also a presbyter whose name likewise was Diodorus,[fn-36-P3687_1031920:410-nf] a man of quiet and gentle disposition, and well reputed both for his faith and for the excellence of his general character.

He was a true disciple of the Apostle who says, \"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth Iris head.\"[fn-50-P5040_1576353:8-nf] And \"a man indeed ought not to cover his bead forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-50-P5041_1576454:9-nf] Oaths were shunned by Gregory, that pure soul, worthy of the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, content with yea and nay, in accordance with the commandment of the Lord Who said, \"I say unto you swear not at all?\"[fn-50-P5042_1576681:10-nf] Gregory could not bear to call his brother a fool,[fn-50-P5043_1576750:11-nf] for he stood in awe of the threat of the Lord. Passion, wrath, and bitterness never proceeded out of his mouth. Railing he hated, because it leads not to the kingdom of heaven. Envy and arrogance had been shut out of that guiltless sold. He would never have stood at the altar before being reconciled to his brother. A lie, or any word designed to slander any one, he abominated, as one who knew that lies come from the devil, and that the Lord will destroy all that utter a lie.[fn-50-P5044_1577252:12-nf] If you have none of these things, and are clear of all, then are you verily disciples of the disciple of the Lord. if not, beware lest, in your disputes about the mode of singing psalms, you are straining at the gnat and setting at naught the greatest of the commandments.","title":"Letter CCVII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":11,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_71_letter_liii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2. I exhort you, then, abandon this gain, or, I would rather says this approach to Hell. Do not, by defiling your hands with such bribes, render yourselves unfit to celebrate holy mysteries. But forgive me. I began by discrediting; and now I am threatening as though I were convinced. If, after this letter of mine, any one do anything of the kind, he will depart from the altars here and will seek a place where he is able to buy and to sell God's gift. We and the Churches of God have no such custom.[fn-33-P3395_1111715:5-nf] One word more, and I have done. These things come of covetousness. Now covetousness is the root of all evil and is called idolatry.[fn-33-P3396_1111869:6-nf] Do not then price idols above Christ for the sake of a little money. Do not imitate Judas and once more betray for a bribe Him who was crucified for us.
