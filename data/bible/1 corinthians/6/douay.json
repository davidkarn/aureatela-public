{"verses":["Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged\nbefore the unjust:  and not before the saints?","Know you not that the saints shall judge this world?  And if the\nworld shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest\nmatters?","Know you not that we shall judge angels?  How much more things of\nthis world?","If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this\nworld, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.","I speak to your shame.  Is it so that there is not among you any\none wise man that is able to judge between his brethren?","But brother goeth to law with brother:  and that before\nunbelievers.","Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have\nlaw suits one with another.  Why do you not rather take wrong?  Why do\nyou not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?","But you do wrong and defraud:  and that to your brethren.","Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God?\nDo not err:  Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers:","Nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor\ncovetous nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the\nkingdom of God.","And such some of you were.  But you are washed:  but you are\nsanctified:  but you are justified:  in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ\nand the Spirit of our God.","All things are lawful to me:  but all things are not expedient.\nAll things are lawful to me:  but I will not be brought under the power\nof any.","Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats:  but God shall\ndestroy both it and them.  But the body is not for fornication, but for\nthe Lord:  and the Lord for the body.","Now God hath raised up the Lord and will raise us up also by his\npower.","Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ?  Shall I\nthen take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot?\nGod forbid!","Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one\nbody?  For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.","But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.","Fly fornication.  Every sin that a man doth is without the body:\nbut he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.","Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy\nGhost, who is in you, whom you have from God:  and you are not your own?","For you are bought with a great price.  Glorify and bear God in\nyour body."]}
