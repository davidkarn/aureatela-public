For when to an age[fn-2-P280_55168:11-nf] much more ignorant (than ours) they had disclosed certain well-concealed material substances, and several not well-revealed scientific arts-if it is true that they had laid bare the operations of metallurgy, and had divulged the natural properties of herbs, and had promulgated the powers of enchantments, and had traced out every curious art,[fn-2-P281_55527:12-nf] even to the interpretation of the stars-they conferred properly and as it were peculiarly upon women that instrumental mean of womanly ostentation, the radiances of jewels wherewith necklaces are variegated, and the circlets of gold wherewith the arms are compressed, and the medicaments of orchil with which wools are coloured, and that black powder itself wherewith the eyelids and eyelashes are made prominent.[fn-2-P282_56002:13-nf] What is the quality of these things may be declared meantime, even at this point,[fn-2-P283_56136:14-nf] from the quality and condition of their teachers: in that sinners could never have either shown or supplied anything conducive to integrity, unlawful lovers anything conducive to chastity, renegade spirits anything conducive to the fear of God. If (these things) are to be called teachings, ill masters must of necessity have taught ill; if as wages of lust, there is nothing base of which the wages are honourable. But why was it of so much importance to show these things as well as[fn-2-P284_56688:15-nf] to confer them? Was it that women, without material causes of splendour, and without ingenious contrivances of grace, could not please men, who, while still unadorned, and uncouth and-so to say-crude and rude, had moved (the mind of) angels? or was it that the lovers[fn-2-P285_56999:16-nf] would appear sordid and-through gratuitous use-contumelious, if they had conferred no (compensating) gift on the women who had been enticed into connubial connection with them? But these questions admit of no calculation. Women who possessed angels (as husbands) could desire nothing more; they had, forsooth, made a grand match! Assuredly they who, of course, did sometimes think whence they had fallen,[fn-2-P286_57435:17-nf] and, after the heated impulses of their lusts, looked up toward heaven, thus requited that very excellence of women, natural beauty, as (having proved) a cause of evil, in order that their good fortune might profit them nothing; but that, being turned from simplicity and sincerity, they, together with (the angels) themselves, might become offensive to God. Sure they were that all ostentation, and ambition, and love of pleasing by carnal means, was displeasing to God. And these are the angels whom we are destined to judge:[fn-2-P287_57986:18-nf] these are the angels whom in baptism we renounce:[fn-2-P288_58059:19-nf] these, of course, are the reasons why they have deserved to be judged by man. What business, then, have their things with their judges? What commerce have they who are to condemn with them who are to be condemned? The same, I take it, as Christ has with Belial.[fn-2-P289_58349:20-nf] With what consistency do we mount that (future) judgment-seat to pronounce sentence against those whose gifts we (now) seek after? For you too, (women as you are, ) have the self-same angelic nature promised[fn-2-P290_58586:21-nf] as your reward, the self-same sex as men: the self-same advancement to the dignity of judging, does (the Lord) promise you.

With all this, no one is pressed to endure hardships for which he is unfit; nothing is imposed on any one against his will; nor is he condemned by the rest because he confesses himself too feeble to imitate them: for they bear in mind how strongly Scripture enjoins charity on all: they bear in mind \"To the pure all things are pure,\"[fn-5-P539_241192:98-nf] and \"Not that which entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out of it.\"[fn-5-P540_241302:99-nf] Accordingly, all their endeavors are concerned not about the rejection of kinds of food as polluted, but about the subjugation of inordinate desire and the maintenance of brotherly love. They remember, \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them;\"[fn-5-P541_241612:100-nf] and again, \"Neither if we eat shall we abound, nor if we refrain from eating shall we be in want;\"[fn-5-P542_241733:101-nf] and, above all, this: \"It is good, my brethren, not to eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother is offended;\" for this passage shows that love is the end to be aimed at in all these things. \"For one man,\" he says, \"believes that he can eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. He that eateth, let him not despise him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath approved him.

To his own master he stands or fails; but he shall stand: for God is able to make him to stand.\" And a little after: \"He that eateth, to the Lord he eateth, and giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.\" And also in what follows: \"So every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

Read the rest: it is too long to quote all. You will find that those able to think lightly of such things,-that is, those of greater strength and stability,-are told that they must nevertheless abstain, lest those should be offended who from their weakness are still in need of such abstinence. The people I was describing know and observe these things; for they are Christians, not heretics. They understand Scripture according to the apostolic teaching, not according to the presumptuous and fictitious name of apostle.[fn-5-P545_243904:103-nf] Him that eats not no one despises; him that eats no one judges; he who is weak eats herbs. Many who are strong, however, do this for the sake of the weak; with many the reason for so doing is not this, but that they may have a cheaper diet, and may lead a life of the greatest tranquillity, with the least expensive provision for the support of the body. \"For all things are lawful for me,\" he says; \"but I will not be brought under the power of any.\"[fn-5-P546_244427:104-nf] Thus many do not eat flesh, and yet do not superstitiously regard it as unclean. And so the same people who abstain when in health take it when unwell without any fear, if it is required as a cure. Many drink no wine; but they do not think that wine defiles them; for they cause it to be given with the greatest propriety and moderation to people of languid temperament, and, in short, to all who cannot have bodily health without it. When some foolishly refuse it, they counsel them as brothers not to let a silly superstition make them weaker instead of making them holier. They read to them the apostle's precept to his disciple to \"take a little wine for his many infirmities.\"[fn-5-P547_245131:105-nf] Then they diligently exercise piety; bodily exercise, they know, profiteth for a short time, as the same apostle says.[fn-5-P548_245271:106-nf] ","title":"Of the Morals of the Catholic Church.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"13. Similar evidence has been collected also concerning the Holy Spirit, of which those who have discussed the subject before ourselves have most fully availed themselves, that He too is God, and not a creature. But if not a creature, then not only God (for men likewise are called gods[fn-2-P238_83452:44-nf] ), but also very God; and therefore absolutely equal with the Father and the Son, and in the unity of the Trinity consubstantial and co-eternal. But that the Holy Spirit is not a creature is made quite plain by that passage above all others, where we are commanded not to serve the creature, but the Creator;[fn-2-P239_83782:45-nf] not in the sense in which we are commanded to \"serve\" one another by love,[fn-2-P240_83874:46-nf] which is in Greek douleuein, but in that in which God alone is served, which is in Greek latreuein. From whence they are called idolaters who tender that service to images which is due to God. For it is this service concerning which it is said, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-2-P241_84207:47-nf] For this is found also more distinctly in the Greek Scriptures, which have latreuseij. Now if we are forbidden to serve the creature with such a service, seeing that it is written, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve\" (and hence, too, the apostle repudiates those who worship and serve the creature more than the Creator), then assuredly the Holy Spirit is not a creature, to whom such a service is paid by all the saints; as says the apostle, \"For we are the circumcision, which serve the Spirit of God,\"[fn-2-P242_84764:48-nf] which is in the Greek latreuontej. For even most Latin copies also have it thus, \"We who serve the Spirit of God;\" but all Greek ones, or almost all, have it so. Although in some Latin copies we find, not \"We worship the Spirit of God,\" but, \"We worship God in the Spirit.\" But let those who err in this case, and refuse to give up to the more weighty authority, tell us whether they find this text also varied in the mss.: \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\" Yet what can be more senseless or more profane, than that any one should dare to say that the members of Christ are the temple of one who, in their opinion, is a creature inferior to Christ? For the apostle says in another place, \"Your bodies are members of Christ.\" But if the members of Christ are also the temple of the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit is not a creature; because we must needs owe to Him, of whom our body is the temple, that service wherewith God only is to be served, which in Greek is called latreia. And accordingly the apostle says, \"Therefore glorify God in your body.\"[fn-2-P243_85922:49-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_09_canonical_epistle_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The meats are no burden to us, most holy father,[fn-4-P410_84924:2-nf] if the captives ate things which their conquerors set before them, especially since there is one report from all, viz., that the barbarians who have made inroads into our parts have not sacrificed to idols. For the apostle says, \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.\"[fn-4-P411_85270:3-nf] But the Saviour also, who cleanseth all meats, says, \"Not that which goeth into a man defileth the man, but that which cometh out.\"[fn-4-P412_85420:4-nf] And this meets the case of the captive women defiled by the barbarians, who outraged their bodies. But if the previous life of any such person convicted him of going, as it is written, after the eyes of fornicators, the habit of fornication evidently becomes an object of suspicion also in the time of captivity. And one ought not readily to have communion with such women in prayers.

Was an angel, then, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

But why is He previously called the Angel of the Lord, when He appeared in a flame of fire out of the bush? Was it because it was one of many angels, who by an economy [or arrangement] bare the person of his Lord? or was something of the creature assumed by Him in order to bring about a visible appearance for the business in hand, and that words might thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord might be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of man, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of the angels, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of the Son which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the Holy Spirit, or that of God the Father, or altogether of the Trinity itself, who is the one and only God, in order that he might say, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\" For we cannot say that the Son of God is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and that the Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that either the Holy Spirit, or the Trinity itself, whom we believe and understand to be the one God, is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he who is not God, is not the God of those fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is God, as all, even heretics, admit; but also the Son, which, whether they will or not, they are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, \"Who is over all, God blessed for ever;\" and the Holy Spirit, since the same apostle says, \"Therefore glorify God in your body;\" when he had said above, \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\"[fn-5-P567_212549:82-nf] and these three are one God, as catholic soundness believes: it is not sufficiently apparent which person of the Trinity that angel bare, if he was one of the rest of the angels, and whether any person, and not rather that of the Trinity itself. But if the creature was assumed for the purpose of the business in hand, whereby both to appear to human eyes, and to sound in human ears, and to be called the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord, and God; then cannot God here be understood to be the Father, but either the Son or the Holy Spirit.

By them you will understand why the first man, obeying his belly and not God, was cast down from paradise into this vale of tears;[fn-6-P672_130882:407-nf] and why Satan used hunger to tempt the Lord Himself in the wilderness;[fn-6-P673_130980:408-nf] and why the apostle cries: \"Meats for the belly and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both it and them;\"[fn-6-P674_131127:409-nf] and why he speaks of the self-indulgent as men \"whose God is their belly.\"[fn-6-P675_131224:410-nf] For men invariably worship what they like best. Care must be taken, therefore, that abstinence may bring back to Paradise those whom satiety once drove out.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"522","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8. In the sequel we go on to Speak thus:[fn-15-P1586_359893:1092-nf] \"The apostle, in concluding his discussion of marriage and of virginity, is careful to observe a mean course in discriminating between them, and, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, he keeps to the King's highway,[fn-15-P1587_360147:1093-nf] and thus fulfils the injunction, `Be not righteous overmuch.'[fn-15-P1588_360230:1094-nf] Moreover, when he goes on to compare monogamy with digamy, he puts digamy after monogamy, just as before he subordinated marriage to virginity.\" Do we not clearly show by this language what is typified in the Holy Scriptures by the terms right and left, and also what we take to be the meaning of the words \"Be not righteous overmuch\"? We turn to the left if, following the lust of Jews and Gentiles, we burn for sexual intercourse; we turn to the right if, following the error of the Manichaeans, we under a pretence of chastity entangle ourselves in the meshes of unchastity. But we keep to the King's highway if we aspire to virginity yet refrain from condemning marriage. Can any one, moreover, be so unfair in his criticism of my poor treatise as to allege that I condemn first marriages, when he reads my opinion on second ones as follows:[fn-15-P1589_361102:1095-nf] \"The apostle, it is true, allows second marriages, but only to such women as are bent upon them, to such as cannot contain,[fn-15-P1590_361251:1096-nf] lest `when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they marry, having condemnation because they have rejected their first faith,'[fn-15-P1591_361410:1097-nf] and he makes this concession because many `are turned aside after Satan.'[fn-15-P1592_361526:1098-nf] But they will be happier if they abide as widows. To this he immediately adds his apostolical authority, `after my judgment.' Moreover, lest any should consider that authority, being human, to be of small weight, he goes on to say, `and I think also that I have the spirit of God.'[fn-15-P1593_361831:1099-nf] Thus, where he urges men to continence he appeals not to human authority, but to the Spirit of God; but when he gives them permission to marry he does not mention the Spirit of God, but allows prudential considerations to turn the balance, relaxing the strictness of his code in favor of individuals according to their several needs.\" Having thus brought forward proofs that second marriages are allowed by the apostle, we at once added the remarks which follow:[fn-15-P1594_362319:1100-nf] \"As marriage is permitted to virgins by reason of the danger of fornication, and as what in itself is not desirable is thus made excusable, so by reason of the same danger widows are permitted to marry a second time. For it is better that a woman should know one man (though he should be a second husband or a third) than that she should know several. In other words, it is preferable that she should prostitute herself to one rather than to many.\" Calumny may do its worst. We have spoken here not of a first marriage, but of a second, of a third, or (if you like) of a fourth. But lest any one should apply my words (that it is better for a woman to prostitute herself to one man than to several) to a first marriage when my whole argument dealt with digamy and trigamy, I marked my own view of these practices with the words:[fn-15-P1595_363173:1101-nf] \"`All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient.'[fn-15-P1596_363258:1102-nf] I do not condemn digamists nor yet trigamists, nor even, to put an extreme, case, octogamists. I will make a still greater concession: I am ready to receive even a whore-monger, if penitent.

I speak plainly. To use the language of Scripture, I do not spare to pluck out my own eye if it cause me to offend, nor to cut off my hand and my foot if they cause me to do so.[fn-18-P1802_437773:1250-nf] And you must be treated in the same way whether you are my eyes, or my hands, or my feet. For what Catholic, what Christian who adorns his faith with good works, can hear with calmness Origen's teaching and counsel, or believe in his extraordinary preaching? \"The Son,\" he tells us, \"cannot see the Father, and the Holy Spirit cannot see the Son.\" These words occur in his book \"On First Principles;\" thus we read, and thus Origen has spoken. \"For as it is unsuitable to say that the Son can see the Father, it is consequently unsuitable to suppose that the Spirit can see the Son.\"[fn-18-P1803_438397:1251-nf] Can any one, moreover, brook Origen's assertion that men's souls were once angels in heaven, and that having sinned in the upper world, they have been cast down into this, and have been confined in bodies as in barrows or tombs, to pay the penalty for their former sins; and that the bodies of believers are not temples of Christ,[fn-18-P1804_438768:1252-nf] but prisons of the condemned? Again, he tampers with the true meaning of the narrative by a false use of allegory, multiplying words without limit; and undermines the faith of the simple by the most varied arguments. Now he maintains that souls, in Greek the \"cool things,\" from a word meaning to be cool,[fn-18-P1805_439113:1253-nf] are so called because in coming down from the heavenly places to the lower world they have lost their former heat;[fn-18-P1806_439318:1254-nf] and now, that our bodies are called by the Greeks chains, from a word meaning chain,[fn-18-P1807_439436:1255-nf] or else (on the analogy of our own Latin word) \"things fallen,\"[fn-18-P1808_439541:1256-nf] because our souls have fallen from heaven; and that the other word for body which the abundance of the Greek idiom supplies[fn-18-P1809_439715:1257-nf] is by many taken to mean a funeral monument,[fn-18-P1810_439775:1258-nf] because the soul is shut up within it in the same way as the corpses of the dead are shut up in tombs and barrows. If this doctrine is true what becomes of our faith? Where is the preaching of the resurrection? Where is the teaching of the apostles, which lasts on to this day in the churches of Christ? Where is the blessing to Adam, and to his seed, and to Noah and his sons? \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\"[fn-18-P1811_440222:1259-nf] According to Origen, these words must be a curse and not a blessing; for he turns angels into human souls, compelling them to leave the place of highest rank and to come down lower, as though God were unable through the action of His blessing to grant souls to the human race, had the angels not sinned, and as though for every birth on earth there must be a fall in heaven. We are to give up, then, the teaching of apostles and prophets, of the law, and of our Lord and Saviour Himself, in spite of His language loud as thunder in the gospel. Origen, on the other hand, commands and urges-not to say binds-his disciples not to pray to ascend into heaven, lest sinning once more worse than they had sinned on earth they should be hurled down into the world again. Such foolish and insane notions he generally confirms by distorting the sense of the Scriptures and making them mean what they do not mean at all. He quotes this passage from the Psalms: \"Before thou didst humble me by reason of my wickedness, I went wrong;\"[fn-18-P1812_441278:1260-nf] and this, \"Return unto thy rest, O my soul;\"[fn-18-P1813_441398:1261-nf] this also, \"Bring my soul out of prison;\"[fn-18-P1814_441462:1262-nf] and this, \"I will make confession unto the Lord in the land of the living,\"[fn-18-P1815_441562:1263-nf] although there can be no doubt that the meaning of the divine Scripture is different from the interpretation by which he unfairly wrests it to the support of his own heresy. This way of acting is common to the Manichaeans, the Gnostics, the Ebionites, the Marcionites, and the votaries of the other eighty heresies,[fn-18-P1816_441946:1264-nf] all of whom draw their proofs from the pure well of the Scriptures, not, however, interpreting it in the sense in which it is written, but trying to make the simple language of the Church's writers accord with their own wishes.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"664","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9.

Many trample covetousness under foot, and lay it down as readily as they lay down their purse. An enforced silence serves to make amends for a railing tongue. The outward appearance and the mode of dress can be changed in a single hour. All other sins are external, and what is external can easily be cast away. Desire alone, implanted in men by God to lead them to procreate children, is internal; and this, if it once oversteps its own bounds, becomes a sin, and by a law of nature cries out for sexual intercourse. It is therefore a work of great merit, and one which requires unremitting diligence to overcome that which is innate in you; while living in the flesh not to live after the flesh; to strive with yourself day by day and to watch the foe shut up within you with the hundred eyes of the fabled Argus.[fn-22-P2214_545641:1572-nf] This is what the apostle says in other words: \"Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\"[fn-22-P2215_545887:1573-nf] Physicians and others who have written on the nature of the human body, and particularly Galen in his books entitled On matters of health, say that the bodies of boys and of young men and of full grown men and women glow with an interior heat and consequently that for persons of these ages all food is injurious which tends to promote this heat: while on the other hand it is highly conducive to health in eating and in drinking to take things cold and cooling. Contrariwise they tell us that warm food and old wine are good for the old who suffer from humours and from chilliness.

The face is the mirror of the mind and a woman's eyes without a word betray the secrets of her heart. I have lately seen a most miserable scandal traverse the entire East. The lady's age and style, her dress and mien, the indiscriminate company she kept, her dainty table and her regal appointments bespoke her the bride of a Nero or of a Sardanapallus. The scars of others should teach us caution. `When he that causeth trouble is scourged the fool will be wiser.'[fn-22-P2241_553213:1594-nf] A holy love knows no impatience. A false rumor is quickly crushed and the after life passes judgment on that which has gone before. It is not indeed possible that any one should come to the end of life's race without suffering from calumny; the wicked find it a consolation to carp at the good, supposing the guilt of sin to be less, in proportion as the number of those who commit it is greater. Still a fire of straw quickly dies out and a spreading flame soon expires if fuel to it be wanting.

Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body,\"[fn-22-P2288_569235:1629-nf] and so on. The holy apostle has been arguing against excess and has just before said \"meats for the belly and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.\"[fn-22-P2289_569435:1630-nf] Now he comes to treat of fornication. For excess in eating is the mother of lust; a belly that is distended with food and saturated with draughts of wine is sure to lead to sensual passion. As has been elsewhere said \"the arrangement of man's organs suggests the course of his vices.\"[fn-22-P2290_569744:1631-nf] Accordingly all such sins as theft, manslaughter, pillage, perjury, and the like can be repented of after they have been committed; and, however much interest may tempt him, conscience always smites the offender.

Let every man examine his own conscience and let him deplore the violence he has done to it at every period of his life; and then when he has brought himself to deliver a true judgment on his own former misdeeds, let him give ear to the chiding of Jesus: \"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shall thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\"[fn-28-P2856_755013:2031-nf] Truly like the scribes and pharisees we strain out the gnat and swallow the camel, we pay tithe of mint and anise, and we omit the just judgment which God requires.[fn-28-P2857_755201:2032-nf] What parallel can be drawn between a wife and a prostitute?

Perhaps indeed you will say that you feared to contract marriage lest by so doing you might disqualify yourself for ordination.

And because at the very outset there is a rock in the path and she is overwhelmed by a storm of censure, for having forsaken her first husband and having taken a second, I will not praise her for her conversion till I have first cleared her of this charge. So terrible then were the faults imputed to her former husband that not even a prostitute or a common slave could have put up with them. If I were to recount them, I should undo the heroism of the wife who chose to bear the blame of a separation rather than to blacken the character and expose the stains of him who was one body with her. I will only urge this one plea which is sufficient to exonerate a chaste matron and a Christian woman. The Lord has given commandment that a wife must not be put away \"except it be for fornication, and that, if put away, she must remain unmarried.\"[fn-32-P3210_839707:2325-nf] Now a commandment which is given to men logically applies to women also. For it cannot be that, while an adulterous wife is to be put away, an incontinent husband is to be retained. The apostle says: \"he which is joined to an harlot is one body.\"[fn-32-P3211_839993:2326-nf] Therefore she also who is joined to a whoremonger and unchaste person is made one body with him. The laws of Caesar are different, it is true, from the laws of Christ: Papinianus[fn-32-P3212_840196:2327-nf] commands one thing; our own Paul another. Earthly laws give a free rein to the unchastity of men, merely condemning seduction and adultery; lust is allowed to range unrestrained among brothels and slave girls, as if the guilt were constituted by the rank of the person assailed and not by the purpose of the assailant. But with us Christians what is unlawful for women is equally unlawful for men, and as both serve the same God both are bound by the same obligations. Fabiola then has put away-they are quite right-a husband that was a sinner, guilty of this and that crime, sins-I have almost mentioned their names-with which the whole neighbourhood resounded but which the wife alone refused to disclose. If however it is made a charge against her that after repudiating her husband she did not continue unmarried, I readily admit this to have been a fault, but at the same time declare that it may have been a case of necessity. \"It is better,\" the apostle tells us, \"to marry than to burn.\"[fn-32-P3213_841351:2328-nf] She was quite a young woman, she was not able to continue in widowhood. In the words of the apostle she saw another law in her members warring against the law of her mind;[fn-32-P3214_841548:2329-nf] she felt herself dragged in chains as a captive towards the indulgences of wedlock. Therefore she thought it better openly to confess her weakness and to accept the semblance of an unhappy marriage than, with the flame of a monogamist, to ply the trade of a courtesan. The same apostle wills that the younger widows should marry, bear children, and give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.[fn-32-P3215_841978:2330-nf] And he at once goes on to explain his wish: \"for some are already turned aside after Satan.\"[fn-32-P3216_842094:2331-nf] Fabiola therefore was fully persuaded in her own mind: she thought she had acted legitimately in putting away her husband, and that when she had done so she was free to marry again. She did not know that the rigour of the gospel takes away from women all pretexts for re-marriage so long as their former husbands are alive; and not knowing this, though she contrived to evade other assaults of the devil, she at this point unwittingly exposed herself to a wound from him.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1254","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"4.

Your former wife, who is now your sister and fellow-servant, has told me that, acting on the apostolic precept,[fn-45-P4505_1222587:3205-nf] you and she lived apart by consent that you might give yourselves to prayer; but that after a time your feet sank beneath you as if resting on water and indeed-to speak plainly-gave way altogether. For her part she heard the Lord saying to her as to Moses: \"as for thee stand thou here by me;\"[fn-45-P4506_1222905:3206-nf] and with the psalmist she said of Him: \"He hath set my feet upon a rock.\"[fn-45-P4507_1223001:3207-nf] But your house-she went on-having no sure foundation of faith fell before a whirlwind of the devil.[fn-45-P4508_1223121:3208-nf] Hers however still stands in the Lord, and does not refuse its shelter to you; you can still be joined in spirit to her to whom you were once joined in body.

Perform, now, the vow which you then made in the presence of God. Human life is uncertain.

I beseech you therefore, my devout daughter in Christ, not to dwell on those passages which offer succour to the incontinent and the unhappy but rather to read those in which chastity is crowned. It is enough for you that you have lost the first and highest kind, that of virginity, and that you have passed through the third to the second; that is to say, having formerly fulfilled the obligations of a wife, that you now live in continence as a widow. Think not of the lowest grade, nay of that which does not count at all, I mean, second marriage; and do not seek for far fetched precedents to justify you in marrying again. You cannot too closely imitate your grandmother, your mother, and your aunt; whose teaching and advice as to life will form for you a rule of virtue. For if many wives in the lifetime of their husbands come to realize the truth of the apostle's words: \"all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient,\"[fn-45-P4583_1248147:3264-nf] and make eunuchs of themselves for the kingdom of heaven's sake[fn-45-P4584_1248235:3265-nf] either by consent after their regeneration through the baptismal laver, or else in the ardour of their faith immediately after their marriage; why should not a widow, who by God's decree has ceased to have a husband, joyfully cry again and again with Job: \"the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,\"[fn-45-P4585_1248562:3266-nf] and seize the opportunity offered to her of having power over her own body instead of again becoming the servant of a man. Assuredly it is much harder to abstain from enjoying what you have than it is to regret what you have lost. Virginity is the easier because virgins know nothing of the promptings of the flesh, and widowhood is the harder because widows cannot help thinking of the license they have enjoyed in the past. And it is harder still if they suppose their husbands to be lost and not gone before; for while the former alternative brings pain, the latter causes joy.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1274","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"13.

Hence also the devil mocks those who are his own until this very day, to whom he presents himself as a false mediator, as though they would be cleansed or rather entangled and drowned by his rites, in that he very easily persuades the proud to ridicule and despise the death of Christ, from which the more he himself is estranged, the more is he believed by them to be the holier and more divine. Yet those who have remained with him are very few, since the nations acknowledge and with pious humility imbibe the price paid for themselves, and in trust upon it abandon their enemy, and gather together to their Redeemer. For the devil does not know how the most excellent wisdom of God makes use of both his snares and his fury to bring about the salvation of His own faithful ones, beginning from the former end, which is the beginning of the spiritual creature, even to the latter end, which is the death of the body, and so \"reaching from the one end to the other, mightily and sweetly ordering all things.\"[fn-9-P930_358007:81-nf] For wisdom \"passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness, and no defiled thing can fall into her.\"[fn-9-P931_358144:82-nf] And since the devil has nothing to do with the death of the flesh, whence comes his exceeding pride, a death of another kind is prepared in the eternal fire of hell, by which not only the spirits that have earthly, but also those who have aerial bodies, can be tormented. But proud men, by whom Christ is despised, because He died, wherein He bought us with so great a price,[fn-9-P932_358544:83-nf] both bring back the former death, and also men, to that miserable condition of nature, which is derived from the first sin, and will be cast down into the latter death with the devil.

Neither will they take into account that the case may possibly be, that the Word of God, remaining in Himself, and in Himself in no way changeable, may yet, through the taking upon Him of a lower nature, be able to suffer somewhat of a lower kind, which the unclean spirit cannot suffer, because he has not an earthly body. And so, whereas they themselves are better than the devils, yet, because they bear a body of flesh, they can so die, as the devils certainly cannot die, who do not bear such a body. They presume much on the deaths of their own sacrifices, which they do not perceive that they sacrifice to deceitful and proud spirits; or if they have come to perceive it. think their friendship to be of some good to themselves, treacherous and envious although they are, whose purpose is bent upon nothing else except to hinder our return.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-04","text":"If these things are so, it is certain that believers contracting marriages with Gentiles are guilty of fornication,[fn-8-P868_209361:23-nf] and are to be excluded from all communication with the brotherhood, in accordance with the letter of the apostle, who says that \"with persons of that kind there is to be no taking of food even.\"[fn-8-P869_209611:24-nf] Or shall we \"in that day\"[fn-8-P870_209662:25-nf] produce (our) marriage certificates before the Lord's tribunal, and allege that a marriage such as He Himself has forbidden has been duly contracted?

Did then God give to a whole people and to the Church the boon of the life with Christ, and yet the life with Christ does not belong to the Holy Spirit? But if this is impious even to think of, is it not rightly reverent so to make our confession, as They are by nature in close conjunction? Furthermore what boundless lack of sensibility does it not shew in these men to confess that the Saints are with Christ,(if, as we know is the case, Paul, on becoming absent from the body, is present with the Lord,[fn-18-P1881_505000:580-nf] and, after departing, is with Christ[fn-18-P1882_505057:581-nf] ) and, so far as lies in their power, to refuse to allow to the Spirit to be with Christ even to the same extent as men? And Paul calls himself a \"labourer together with God\"[fn-18-P1883_505252:582-nf] in the dispensation of the Gospel; will they bring an indictment for impiety against us, if we apply the term \"fellow-labourer\" to the Holy Spirit, through whom in every creature under heaven the Gospel bringeth forth fruit?[fn-18-P1884_505501:583-nf] The life of them that have trusted in the Lord \"is hidden,\" it would seem, \"with Christ in God, and when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall\" they themselves also \"appear with Him in glory;\"[fn-18-P1885_505730:584-nf] and is the Spirit of life Himself, \"Who made us free from the law of sin,\"[fn-18-P1886_505827:585-nf] not with Christ, both in the secret and hidden life with Him, and in the manifestation of the glory which we expect to be manifested in the saints? We are \"heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,\"[fn-18-P1887_506048:586-nf] and is the Spirit without part or lot in the fellowship of God and of His Christ? \"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God;\"[fn-18-P1888_506238:587-nf] and are we not to allow to the Spirit even that testimony of His fellowship with God which we have learnt from the Lord? For the height of folly is reached if we through the faith in Christ which is in the Spirit[fn-18-P1889_506472:588-nf] hope that we shall be raised together with Him and sit together in heavenly places,[fn-18-P1890_506578:589-nf] whenever He shall change our vile body from the natural to the spiritual,[fn-18-P1891_506792:590-nf] and yet refuse to assign to the Spirit any share in the sitting together, or in the glory, or anything else which we have received from Him. Of all the boons of which, in accordance with the indefeasible grant of Him who has promised them, we have believed ourselves worthy, are we to allow none to the Holy Spirit, as though they were all above His dignity?

But now, when we are contending with those who allow that the children of the baptized ought to be baptized, we may much more conveniently conduct our discussion, and can say: You who assert that the children of such persons as have been cleansed from the pollution of sin ought to have been born without sin, why do you not perceive that by the same rule you might just as well say that the children of Christian parents ought to have been born Christians? Why, therefore, do you rather maintain that they ought to become Christians? Was there not in their parents, to whom it is said, \"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?\"[fn-12-P1206_623829:39-nf] a Christian body? Perhaps you suppose that a Christian body may be born of Christian parents, without having received a Christian soul? Well, this would render the case much more wonderful still. For you would think of the soul one of two things as you pleased, -because, of course, you hold with the apostle, that before birth it had done nothing good or evil:[fn-12-P1207_624211:40-nf] -either that it was derived by transmission, and just as the body of Christians is Christian, so should also their soul be Christian; or else that it was created by Christ, either in the Christian body, or for the sake of the Christian body, and it ought therefore to have been created or given in a Christian condition. Unless perchance you shall pretend that, although Christian parents had it in their power to beget a Christian body, yet Christ Himself was not able to produce a Christian soul. Believe then the truth, and see that, as it has been possible (as [you yourselves admit) for one who is not a Christian to be born of Christian parents, forone who is not a member of Christ to be born of members of Christ, and (that we may answer all, who, however falsely, are yet in some sense possessed with a sense of religion) for a man who is not consecrated to be born of parents who are consecrated; so also it is quite possible for one who is not cleansed to be born of parents who are cleansed. Now what account will you give us, of why from Christian parents is born one who is not a Christian, unless it be that not generation, but regeneration makes Christians? Resolve therefore your own question with a like reason, that cleansing from sin comes to no one by being born, but to all by being born again. And thus any child who is born of parents who are cleansed, because born again, must himself be born again, in order that he too may be cleansed. For it has been quite possible for parents to transmit to their children that which they did not possess themselves,- thus resembling not only the wheat which yielded the chaff, and the circumcised the foreskin, but also the instance which you yourselves adduce, even that of believers who convey unbelief to their posterity; which, however, does not accrue to the faithful as regenerated by the Spirit, but it is owing to the fault of the mortal seed by which they have been born of the flesh. For in respect of the infants whom you judge it necessary to make believers by the sacrament of the faithful you do not deny that they were born in unbelief although of believing parents.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_08_lecture_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"8.

In the above discussion the Apostle has taught that the believer ought not to depart from the unbeliever, but remain in marriage as the faith found them, and that each man whether married or single should continue as he was when baptized into Christ; and then he suddenly introduces the metaphors of circumcision and uncircumcision, of bond and free, and under those metaphors treats of the married and unmarried.[fn-62-P6202_1874009:58-nf] \"Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: but even if thou canst become free, use it rather. For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman; likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant. Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.\" Some, I suppose, will find fault with the Apostle's way of reasoning. I would therefore ask first, What we are to infer from his suddenly passing in a discussion concerning husbands and wives to a comparison of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, and then returning, when this point is settled, to the question about virgins, and telling us \"Concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord\"; what has a comparison of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, to do with wedlock and virginity? In the next place, how are we to understand the words \"Hath any been called in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised\"?[fn-62-P6203_1875260:59-nf] Can a man who has lost his foreskin restore it again at his pleasure? Then, in what sense are we to explain \"For he that was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant.\" Fourthly, how is it that he who commanded servants to obey their masters according to the flesh, now says, \"Become net bondservants of men.\" Lastly, how are we to connect with slavery, or with circumcision, his saying \"Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God,\" which even contradicts his previous opinion. We heard him say \"Become not bondservants of men.\" How can we then possibly abide in that vocation wherein we were called, when many at the time they became believers had masters according to the flesh, whose bondservants they are now forbidden to be? Moreover, what has the argument about our abiding in the vocation wherein we were called, to do with circumcision? for in another place the same Apostle cries aloud \"Behold I Paul tell you that, if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing\"? We must conclude, therefore, that a higher meaning should be given to circumcision and uncircumcision, bond and free, and that these words must be taken in close connection with what has gone before. \"Was anyone called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.\" If, he says, at the time you were called and became a believer in Christ, if I say, you were called being circumcised from a wife, that is, unmarried, do not marry a wife, that is, do not become uncircumcised, lest you lay upon the freedom of circumcision and chastity the burden of marriage. Again, if anyone was called in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised. You had a wife, he says, when you believed: do not think the faith of Christ a reason for disagreement, because God called us in peace.[fn-62-P6204_1877420:60-nf] \"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.\" For neither celibacy nor marriage availeth anything without works, since even faith, which is specially characteristic of Christians, if it have not works, is said to be dead, and vestal virgins and Juno's widows might upon these terms be numbered with the saints. \"Let each man in the vocation wherein he was called, therein abide.\" Whether he had, or had not, a wife when he believed, let him remain in that condition in which he was when called. Accordingly he does not so strongly urge virgins to be married, as forbid divorce. And as he debars those who have wives from putting them away, so he cuts off from virgins the power of being married. \"Thou wast called being a slave, heed it not; but even if thou canst become free, use it rather.\" Even if you have, he says, a wife, and are bound to her, and pay her due, and have not power over your own body; or if, to speak more clearly, you are the bondservant of your wife, be not sad upon that account, nor sigh for the loss of your virginity. But even if you can find some causes of discord, do not, for the sake of thoroughly enjoying the liberty of chastity, seek your own welfare by destroying another. Keep your wife awhile, and do not go too fast for her lagging footsteps: wait till she follows. If you are patient, your spouse will become a sister, \"For he that was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise, he that was called being free, is Christ's bondservant.\" He gives his reasons for not wishing wives to be forsaken. He therefore says, I command that Gentiles who believe on Christ do not abandon the married state in which they were before embracing the faith: for he who had a wife when he became a believer, is not so strictly devoted to the service of God as virgins and unmarried persons. But, in a manner, he has more freedom, and the reins of his bondage are relaxed; and, while he is the bondservant of a wife, he is, so to speak, the freedman of the Lord. Moreover, he who when called by the Lord had not a wife and was free from the bondage of wedlock, he is truly Christ's bondservant. What happiness to be the bondservant, not of a wife but of Christ, to serve not the flesh, but the spirit![fn-62-P6205_1879747:61-nf] \"For he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.\" There was some fear that by saying \"Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: but, even if thou canst become free, use it rather,\" he might seem to have flouted continence, and to have given us up to the slavery of marriage. He therefore makes a remark which removes all cavil: \"Ye were bought with a price, become not servants of men.\" We have been redeemed with the most precious blood of Christ: the Lamb was slain for us, and having been sprinkled with hyssop and the warm drops of His blood, we have rejected poisonous pleasure.

The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

But he had withal said above: \"Are we, then, making void the law through faith? Far be it; but we are establishing the law \"[fn-13-P1360_376068:61-nf] -forsooth in those (points) which, being even now interdicted by the New Testament, are prohibited by an even more emphatic precept: instead of, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" \"Whoever shall have seen with a view to concupiscence, hath already committed adultery in his own heart; \"[fn-13-P1361_376373:62-nf] and instead of, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" \"Whoever shall have said to his brother, Racha, shall be in danger of hell.\"[fn-13-P1362_376511:63-nf] Ask (yourself) whether the law of not committing adultery be still in force, to which has been added that of not indulging concupiscence. Besides, if any precedents (taken from the Old Dispensation) shall favour you in (the secrecy of) your bosom, they shall not be set in opposition to this discipline which we are maintaining. For it is in vain that an additional law has been reared, condemning the origin even of sins-that is, concupiscences and wills-no less than the actual deeds; if the fact that pardon was of old in some cases conceded to adultery is to be a reason why it shall be conceded at the present day. \"What will be the reward attaching to the restrictions imposed upon the more fully developed discipline of the present day, except that the eider (discipline) may be made the agent for granting indulgence to your prostitution? \"In that case, you will grant pardon to the idolater too, and to every apostate, because we find the People itself, so often guilty of these crimes, as often reinstated in their former privileges.

We, too, indeed have precedents in the self-same antiquity on the side of our opinion,-(precedents) of judgment not merely not waived, but even summarily executed upon fornication. And of course it is a sufficient one, that so vast a number-(the number) of 24, 000-of the People, when they committed fornication with the daughters of Madian, fell in one plague.[fn-13-P1368_378811:69-nf] But, with an eye to the glory of Christ, I prefer to derive (my) discipline from Christ. Grant that the pristine days may have had-if the Psychics please-even a right of (indulging) every immodesty; grant that, before Christ, the flesh may have disported itself, nay, may have perished before its Lord went to seek and bring it back: not yet was it worthy of the gift of salvation; not yet apt for the office of sanctity. It was still, up to that time, accounted as being in Adam, with its own vicious nature, easily indulging concupiscence after whatever it had seen to be \"attractive to the sight,\"[fn-13-P1369_379449:70-nf] and looking back at the lower things, and checking its itching with fig-leaves.[fn-13-P1370_379576:71-nf] Universally inherent was the virus of lust-the dregs which are formed out of milk contain it-(dregs) fitted (for so doing), in that even the waters themselves had not yet been bathed.

Some other, then, it was to whom he willed the \"rebuke\" to be sufficient; if, that is, the fornicator had incurred not \"rebuke\" from his sentence, but \"condemnation.\" For I offer you withal, for your investigation, this very question: Whether there were in the first Epistle others, too, who \"wholly saddened\" the apostle by \"acting disorderly,\"[fn-14-P1469_425029:137-nf] and \"were wholly saddened\" by him, through incurring (his) \"rebuke,\" according to the sense of the second Epistle; of whom some particular one may in that (second Epistle) have received pardon.

I will follow in detail the views now expounded, and before I come to Scripture and show by it that fasting is pleasing to God, and chastity accepted by him, I will meet philosophic argument with argument, and will prove that we are not followers of Empedocles and Pythagoras, who on account of their doctrine of the transmigration of souls think nothing which lives and moves should be eaten, and look upon him who fells a fir-tree or an oak as equally guilty with the parricide or the poisoner: but that we worship our Creator Who made all things for the use of man. And as the ox was created for ploughing, the horse for riding, dogs for watching, goats for milk, sheep for their wool: so it was with swine and stags, and roes and hares, and other animals: but the immediate purpose of their creation was not that they might serve for food, but for other uses of men. For if everything that moves and lives was made for food, and prepared for the stomach, let my opponents tellme why elephants, lions, leopards, and wolves were created; why vipers, scorpions, bugs, lice, and fleas; why the vulture, the eagle, the crow, the hawk; why whales, dolphins, seals, and small snails were created. Which of us ever eats the flesh of a lion, a viper, a vulture, a stork, a kite, or the worms that crawl upon our shores? As then these have their proper uses, so may we say that other beasts, fishes, birds, were created not for eating, but for medicine. In short, to how many uses the flesh of vipers, from which we make our antidotes against poison, may be applied, physicians know well. Ivory dust is an ingredient in many remedies. Hyena's gall restores brightness to the eyes, and its dung and that of dogs cures gangrenous wounds. And (it may seem strange to the reader) Galen asserts in his treatise on Simples, that human dung is of service in a multitude of cases. Naturalists say that snake-skin, boiled in oil, gives wonderful relief in ear-ache. What to the uninitiated seems so useless as a bug? Yet, suppose a leech to have fastened on the throat, as soon as the odour of a bug is inhaled the leech is vomited out, and difficulty in urinating is relieved by the same application. As for the fat of pigs, geese, fowls, and pheasants, how useful they are is told in all medical works, and if you read these books you will see there that the vulture has as many curative properties as it has limbs. Peacock's dung allays the inflammation of gout. Cranes, storks, eagle's gall, hawk's blood, the ostrich, frogs, chameleons, swallow's dung and flesh-in what diseases these are suitable remedies, I could tell if it were my purpose to discuss bodily ailments and their cure. If you think proper you may read Aristotle and[fn-66-P6666_2093457:73-nf] Theophrastus in prose, or[fn-66-P6667_2093508:74-nf] Marcellus of Side, and our[fn-66-P6668_2093703:75-nf] Flavius, who discourse on these subjects in hexameter verse; the[fn-66-P6669_2094046:76-nf] second Pliny also, and[fn-66-P6670_2094294:77-nf] Dioscorides, and others, both naturalists and physicians, who assign to every herb, every stone, every animal whether reptile, bird, or fish, its own use in the art of which they treat. So then when you ask me why the pig was created, I immediately reply, as if two boys were disputing, by asking you why were vipers and scorpions? You must not judge that anything from the hand of God is superfluous, because there are many beasts and birds which your palate rejects. But this may perhaps look more like contentiousness and pugnacity than truth. Let me tell you therefore that pigs and wild-boars, and stags, and the rest of living creatures were created, that soldiers, athletes, sailors, rhetoricians, miners, and other slaves of hard toil, who need physical strength, might have food: and also those who carry arms and provisions, who wear themselves out with the work of hand or foot, who ply the oar, who need good lungs to shout and speak, who level mountains and sleep out rain or fair. But our religion does not train boxers, athletes, sailors, soldiers, or ditchers, but followers of wisdom, who devote themselves to the worship of God, and know why they were created and are in the world from which they are impatient to depart. Hence also the Apostle says:[fn-66-P6671_2095753:78-nf] \"When I am weak, then am I strong.\" And.[fn-66-P6672_2095815:79-nf] \"Though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.\" And[fn-66-P6673_2095919:80-nf] \"I have the desire to depart and be with Christ.\" And,[fn-66-P6674_2095992:81-nf] \"Make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.\" Are all commanded[fn-66-P6675_2096094:82-nf] not to have two coats, nor food in their scrip, money in their purse, a staff in the hand, shoes on the feet? or to sell all they possess and give to the poor, and follow Jesus? Of course not: but the command is for those who wish to be perfect. On the contrary John the Baptist lays down one rule for the soldiers, another for the publicans. But the Lord says in the Gospel to him who had boasted of having kept the whole law:[fn-66-P6676_2096566:83-nf] \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow me.\" That He might not seem to lay a heavy burden on unwilling shoulders, He sent His hearer away with full power to please himself, saying \"If thou wilt be perfect.\" And so I too say to you: If you wish to be perfect, it is good not to drink wine, and eat flesh. If you wish to be perfect, it is better to enrich the mind than to stuff the body.

Then, again, as regards the parable of the sower? the Gospel, we read that the good ground brought forth fruit, some a hundred fold, some sixty fold, and some thirty fold; and, on the other hand, that the bad ground admitted of three degrees of sterility: but Jovinianus makes only two classes, the good soil and the bad.[fn-68-P6800_2151489:187-nf] And as in one Gospel our Lord promises the Apostles a hundred fold, in another seven fold, for leaving children and wives, and in the world to come life eternal; and the seven and the hundred mean the same thing: so, too, in the passage before us, the numbers describing the fertility of the soil need not create any difficulty, particularly when the Evangelist Mark gives the inverse order, thirty, sixty, and a hundred. The Lord says,[fn-68-P6801_2152012:188-nf] \"He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him.\" As, then, there are not varying degrees of Christ's presence in us, so neither are there degrees of our abiding in Christ.[fn-68-P6802_2152235:189-nf] \"Every one that loveth me will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\" He that is righteous, loves Christ: and if a man thus loves, the Father and the Son come to him, and make their abode with him. Now I suppose that when the guest is such asthis the host cannot possibly lack anything. And if our Lord says,[fn-68-P6803_2152629:190-nf] \"In my Father's houseare many mansions,\" His meaning is not that there are different mansions in the kingdom of heaven, but He indicates the number oft Churches in the whole world, for though theChurch be seven-fold she is but one \"I go,\" He says, \"to prepare a place for you,\" not places. If this promise is peculiar to the twelve apostles, then Paul is shut out from that place, and the chosen vessel will be thought superfluous and unworthy. John and James, because they asked more than the others, did not obtain it; and yet their dignity is not diminished, because they were equal to the rest of the apostles.[fn-68-P6804_2153267:191-nf] \"Know ye not that your bodies are a temple of the Holy Ghost?\" A temple, He says, not temples, in order to show that God dwells in all alike.[fn-68-P6805_2153447:192-nf] \"Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word; as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, are one, so they may be all one in us.

It is mere trifling to quote the passage:[fn-68-P6867_2188545:244-nf] \"Know ye not that your bodies are a temple of the Holy Ghost,\" for it is customary in Holy Scripture to speak of a single object as though it were many, and of many as though they were one. And Jovinianus himself should know that even in a temple there are many divisions-the outer and the inner courts, the vestibules, the holy place, and the Holy of Holies. There are also in a temple kitchens, pantries, oil-cellars, and cupboards for the vessels. And so in the temple of our body there are different degrees of merit. God does not dwell in all alike, nor does He impart Himself to all in the same degree. A portion of the spirit of Moses was taken and given to the seventy elders. I suppose there is a difference between the abundance of the river, and that of the rivulets.[fn-68-P6868_2189346:245-nf] Elijah's spirit was given in double measure to Elisha, and thus double grace wrought greater miracles. Elijah while living restored a dead man to life; Elisha after death did the same. Elijah invoked famine on the people; Elisha in a single day put the enemy's forces in the power of the city which they besieged. No doubt the words, \"Know ye not that your bodies are a temple of the Holy Ghost,\" refer to the whole assembly of the faithful, who, joined together, make up the one body of Christ. But the question now is, who in the body is worthy to be the feet of Christ, and who the head? who is His eye, and who His hand? -a distinction indicated by the[fn-68-P6869_2190089:246-nf] two women in the Gospel, the penitent and the holy woman,one of whom held His feet, the other His head. Some authorities. however, think there was only one woman, and that she who began at His feet gradually advanced to His head. Jovinianus further urges against us our Lord's words,[fn-68-P6870_2190437:247-nf] \"I pray not for these only, but also for those who shall believe on me through their word: that as I, Father, in thee and thou in me are one, so they all may be one in us,\" and reminds us that the whole Christian people is one in God, and, as His well-beloved sons, are[fn-68-P6871_2190747:248-nf] \"partakers of the divine nature.\" We have already said, and the truth must now be inculcated more in detail, that we are not one in the Father and the Son according to nature, but according to grace. For the essence of the human soul and the essence of God are not the same, as the Manichaeans constantly assert. But, says our Lord:[fn-68-P6872_2191100:249-nf] \"Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.\" You see, then, that we are privileged to partake of His essence, not in the realm of nature, but of grace, and the reason why we are beloved of the Father is that He has loved the Son; and the members are loved, those namely of the body.[fn-68-P6873_2191409:250-nf] \"For as many as received Christ, to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\" The Word was made flesh that we might pass from the flesh into the Word. The Word did not cease to be what He had been; nor did the human nature lose that which it was by birth. The glory was increased, the nature was not changed.

As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven.\" But the Evangelist John, who had drunk in wisdom from the breast of Christ, agrees herewith, and says:[fn-68-P6875_2192350:252-nf] \"Hereby know we that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.\" If you believe in Christ, as the apostles believed, you shall be made one body with them in Christ.

What had he that was spiritual? Is it because he prophetically declared \"the great mystery of Christ and the church? \"[fn-27-P2796_947493:165-nf] \"This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman.

If, again, the evil of sin was developed in him, this must not be accounted as a natural disposition: it was rather produced by the instigation of the (old) serpent as far from being incidental to his nature as it was from being material in him, for we have already excluded belief in \"Matter.\"[fn-27-P2798_948173:167-nf] Now, if neither the spiritual element, nor what the heretics call the material element, was properly inherent in him (since, if he had been created out of matter, the germ of evil must have been an integral part of his constitution), it remains that the one only original element of his nature was what is called the animal (the principle of vitality, the soul), which we maintain to be simple and uniform in its condition. Concerning this, it remains for us to inquire whether, as being called natural, it ought to be deemed subject to change. (The heretics whom we have referred to) deny that nature is susceptible of any change,[fn-27-P2799_948836:168-nf] in order that they may be able to establish and settle their threefold theory, or \"trinity,\" in all its characteristics as to the several natures, because \"a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree good fruit; and nobody gathers figs of thorns, nor grapes of brambles.\"[fn-28-P2800_949154:169-nf] If so, then \"God will not be able any longer to raise up from the stones children unto Abraham; nor to make a generation of vipers bring forth fruits of repentance.\"[fn-28-P2801_949344:170-nf] And if so, the apostle too was in error when he said in his epistle, \"Ye were at one time darkness, (but now are ye light in the Lord: )\"[fn-28-P2802_949505:171-nf] and, \"We also were by nature children of wrath; \"[fn-28-P2803_949573:172-nf] and, \"Such were some of you, but ye are washed.\"[fn-28-P2804_949641:173-nf] The statements, however, of holy Scripture will never be discordant with truth. A corrupt tree will never yield good fruit, unless the better nature be grafted into it; nor will a good tree produce evil fruit, except by the same process of cultivation. Stones also will become children of Abraham, if educated in Abraham's faith; and a generation of vipers will bring forth the fruits of penitence, if they reject the poison of their malignant nature. This will be the power of the grace of God, more potent indeed than nature, exercising its sway over the faculty that underlies itself within us-even the freedom of our will, which is described as au0tecou/sioj (of independent authority); and inasmuch as this faculty is itself also natural and mutable, in whatsoever direction it turns, it inclines of its own nature. Now, that there does exist within us naturally this independent authority (to\\ au0tecou/sion), we have already shown in opposition both to Marcion[fn-28-P2805_950631:174-nf] and to Hermogenes.[fn-28-P2806_950688:175-nf] if, then, the natural condition has to be submitted to a definition, it must be determined to be twofold-there being the category of the born and the unborn, the made and not-made. Now that which has received its constitution by being made or by being born, is by nature capable of being changed, for it can be both born again and re-made; whereas that which is not-made and unborn will remain for ever immoveable. Since, however, this state is suited to God alone, as the only Being who is unborn and not-made (and therefore immortal and unchangeable), it is absolutely certain that the nature of all other existences which are born and created is subject to modification and change; so that if the threefold state is to be ascribed to the soul, it must be supposed to arise from the mutability of its accidental circumstances, and not from the appointment of nature.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"20.

Lest, then, he make such a rejoinder, consider, some other words of his on this subject: \"The man,\" says he, \"who hastens to the Lord, and desires to be directed by Him, that is, who makes his own will depend upon God's, who moreover cleaves so closely to the Lord as to become (as the apostle says) 'one spirit' with Him,[fn-33-P3329_1288612:57-nf] does all this by nothing else than by his freedom of will.\" Observe how great a result he has here stated to be accomplished only by our freedom of will; and how, in fact, he supposes us to cleave to God without the help of God: for such is the force of his words, \"by nothing else than by his own freedom of will.\" So that, after we have cleaved to the Lord without His help, we even then, because of such adhesion of our own, deserve to be assisted. [XXIII.] For he goes on to say: \"Whosoever makes a right use of this\" (that is, rightly uses his freedom of will), \"does so entirely surrender himself to God, and does so completely mortify his own will, that he is able to say with the apostle, `Nevertheless it is already of I that live, but Christ liveth in me;'[fn-33-P3330_1289399:58-nf] and `He placeth his heart in the hand of God, so that He turneth it whithersoever He willeth.'\"[fn-33-P3331_1289513:59-nf] Great indeed is the help of the grace of God, so that He turns our heart in whatever direction He pleases.

Now all these vast courses of goodness we (according to him) accomplish, forsooth, simply by the freedom of our own free will; and by reason of such antecedent merits we so secure His grace, that He turns our heart which way soever He pleases. Well, now, how is that grace which is not gratuitously conferred? How can it be grace, if it is given in payment of a debt? How can that be true which the apostle says, \"It is not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast;\"[fn-33-P3332_1290473:60-nf] and again, \"If it is of grace, then is it no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace:\"[fn-33-P3333_1290588:61-nf] how, I repeat, can this be true, if such meritorious works precede as to procure for us the bestowal of grace? Surely, under the circumstances, there can be no gratuitous gift, but only the recompense of a due reward. Is it the case, then, that in order to find their way to the help of God, men run to God without God's help?

For while the whole multitude of those that believe receive equal gifts of grace, and all rejoice in the same blessings of the sacraments, those who are virgins possess something above the rest, since, out of the holy and unstained company of the Church, they are chosen by the Holy Spirit, and are presented by the bishop[fn-7-P735_293386:1-nf] at the altar of God, as if being more holy and pure sacrifices, on account of the merits of their voluntary dedication. This is truly a sacrifice worthy of God, inasmuch as it is the offering of so precious a being, and none will please him more than the sacrifice of his own image. For I think that the Apostle especially referred to a sacrifice of this kind, when he said, \"Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable[fn-7-P736_293898:2-nf] to God.\" Virginity, therefore, possesses both that which others have, and that which others have not; while it obtains both common and special grace, and rejoices (so to speak) in its own peculiar privilege of consecration. For ecclesiastical authority permits us to style virgins also the brides of Christ; while, after the manner of brides, it veils those whom it consecrates to the Lord, openly exhibiting those as very especially about to possess spiritual marriage who have fled away from carnal fellowship.

Now, to meet this objection, we must explain the nature[fn-44-P4422_1428760:123-nf] of the soul. We must at the outset hold fast the meaning of the Greek scripture, which has afflatus, not spirit.[fn-44-P4423_1428890:124-nf] Some interpreters of the Greek, without reflecting on the difference of the words, and careless about their exact meaning, put spirit for afflatus; they thus afford to heretics an opportunity of tarnishing[fn-44-P4424_1429349:125-nf] the Spirit of God, that is to say, God Himself, with default. And now comes the question. Afflatus, observe then, is less than spirit, although it comes from spirit; it is the spirit's gentle breeze,[fn-44-P4425_1429568:126-nf] but it is not the spirit. Now a breeze is rarer than the wind; and although it proceeds from wind, yet a breeze is not the wind. One may call a breeze the image of the spirit. In the same manner, man is the image of God, that is, of spirit; for God is spirit. Afflatus is therefore the image of the spirit. Now the image is not in any case equal to the very thing.[fn-44-P4426_1429949:127-nf] It is one thing to be like the reality, and another thing to be the reality itself. So, although the afflatus is the image of the spirit, it is yet not possible to compare the image of God in such a way, that, because the reality-that is, the spirit, or in other words, the Divine Being-is faultless, therefore the afflatus also, that is to say, the image, ought not by any possibility to have done wrong. In this respect will the image be less than the reality, and the afflatus inferior to the spirit, in that, while it possesses beyond doubt the true lineaments of divinity, such as an immortal soul, freedom and its own mastery over itself, foreknowledge in a great degree,[fn-44-P4427_1430644:128-nf] reasonableness, capacity of understanding and knowledge, it is even in these respects an image still, and never amounts to the actual power of Deity, nor to absolute exemption from fault,-a property which is only conceded to God, that is, to the reality, and which is simply incompatible with an image. An image, although it may express all the lineaments of the reality, is yet wanting in its intrinsic power; it is destitute of motion. In like manner, the soul, the image of the spirit, is unable to express the simple power thereof, that is to say, its happy exemption from sinning.[fn-44-P4428_1431248:129-nf] Were it otherwise,[fn-44-P4429_1431302:130-nf] it would not be soul, but spirit; not man, who received a soul, but God. Besides, to take another view of the matter,[fn-44-P4430_1431436:131-nf] not everything which pertains to God will be regarded as God, so that you would not maintain that His afflatus was God, that is, exempt from fault, because it is the breath of God. And in an act of your own, such as blowing into a flute, you would not thereby make the flute human, although it was your own human breath which you breathed into it, precisely as God breathed of His own Spirit, In fact,[fn-44-P4431_1431861:132-nf] the Scripture, by expressly saying[fn-44-P4432_1431912:133-nf] that God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and that man became thereby a living soul, not a life-giving spirit, has distinguished that soul from the condition of the Creator. The work must necessarily be distinct from the workman, and it is inferior to him. The pitcher will not be the potter, although made by the potter; nor in like manner, will the afflatus, because made by the spirit, be on that account the spirit. The soul has often been called by the same name as the breath. You should also take care that no descent be made from the breath to a still lower quality. So you have granted (you say) the infirmity of the soul, which you denied before! Undoubtedly, when you demand for it an equality with God, that is, a freedom from fault, I contend that it is infirm. But when the comparison is challenged with an angel, I am compelled to maintain that the head over all things is the stronger of the two, to whom the angels are ministers,[fn-44-P4433_1432895:134-nf] who is destined to be the judge of angels,[fn-44-P4434_1432957:135-nf] if he shall stand fast in the law of God-an obedience which he refused at first. Now this disobedience[fn-44-P4435_1433081:136-nf] it was possible for the afflatus of God to commit: it was possible, but it was not proper. The possibility lay in its slenderness of nature, as being the breath and not the spirit; the impropriety, however, arose from its power of will, as being free, and not a slave. It was furthermore assisted by the warning against committing sin under the threat of incurring death, which was meant to be a support for its slender nature, and a direction for its liberty of choice. So that the soul can no longer appear to have sinned, because it has an affinity with God, that is to say, through the afflatus, but rather through that which was an addition to its nature, that is, through its free-will, which was indeed given to it by God in accordance with His purpose and reason, but recklessly employed[fn-44-P4436_1433944:137-nf] by man according as he chose. This, then, being the case, the entire course[fn-44-P4437_1434037:138-nf] of God's action is purged from all imputation to evil. For the liberty of the will will not retort its own wrong on Him by whom it was bestowed, but on him by whom it was improperly used. What is the evil, then, which you want to impute to the Creator? If it is man's sin, it will not be God's fault, because it is man's doing; nor is that Being to be regarded as the author of the sin, who turns out to be its forbidder, nay, its condemner. If death is the evil, death will not give the reproach of being its own author to Him who threatened it, but to him who despised it. For by his contempt he introduced it, which assuredly[fn-44-P4438_1434685:139-nf] would not have appeared had man not despised it.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_27_book_i_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This is the reason, indeed, why of even the just and lawful marriages of the children of God are born, not children of God, but children of the world; because also those who generate, if they are already regenerate, beget children not as children of God, but as still children of the world. \"The children of this world,\" says our Lord, beget and are begotten.\"[fn-39-P3957_1495762:74-nf] From the fact, therefore, that we are still children of this world, our outer man is in a state of corruption; and on this account our offspring are born as children of the present world; nor do they become sons of God, except they be regenerated.[fn-39-P3958_1496188:75-nf] Yet inasmuch as we are children of God, our inner man is renewed from day to day.[fn-39-P3959_1496330:76-nf] And yet even our outer man has been sanctified through the laver of regeneration, and has received the hope of future incorruption, on which account it is justly designated as \"the temple of God.\" \"Your bodies,\" says the apostle, \"are the temples of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, and which ye have of God; and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a great price: therefore glorify and carry God in your body.\"[fn-39-P3960_1496769:77-nf] The whole of this statement is made in reference to our present sanctification, but especially in consequence of that hope of which he says in another passage, \"We ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.\"[fn-39-P3961_1497195:78-nf] If, then, the redemption of our body is expected, as the apostle declares, it follows, that being an expectation, it is as yet a matter of hope, and not of actual possession.

Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another. His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"12. In this way, it is the taking of our sins upon Himself by the Lord Christ that is signified in the genealogy of Matthew, while in the genealogy of Luke it is the abolition of our sins by the Lord Christ that is expressed. In accordance with these ideas, the one details the names in the descending scale, and the other in the ascending. For when the apostle says, \"God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin,\"[fn-14-P1403_563657:41-nf] he refers to the taking of our sins upon Himself by Christ. But when he adds, \"for sin, to condemn sin in the flesh,\"[fn-14-P1404_563829:42-nf] he expresses the expiation of sins. Consequently Matthew traces the succession downwards from David through Solomon, in connection with whose mother it was that he sinned; while Luke carries the genealogy upwards to the same David through Nathan,[fn-14-P1405_564181:43-nf] by which prophet God took away[fn-14-P1406_564235:44-nf] his sin.[fn-14-P1407_564259:45-nf] The number, also, which Luke follows does most certainly best indicate the taking away of sins. For inasmuch as in Christ, who Himself had no sin, there is assuredly no iniquity allied to the iniquities of men which He bore in His flesh, the number adopted by Matthew makes forty when Christ is excepted. On the contrary, inasmuch as, by clearing us of all sin and purging us, He places us in a right relation to His own and His Father's righteousness (so that the apostle's word is made good: \"But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit\"[fn-14-P1408_565218:46-nf] ), in the number used by Luke we find included both Christ Himself, with whom the enumeration begins, and God, with whom it closes; and the sum becomes thus seventy-seven, which denotes the through remission and abolition of all sins. This perfect removal of sins the Lord Himself also clearly represented under the mystery of this number, when He said that the person sinning ought to be forgiven not only seven times, but even unto seventy times seven.[fn-14-P1409_565693:47-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"18.

For it is not every kind of good soever, which the Apostle would here set forth, which he hath unambiguously placed above the faith of married women. But how great good the faith of married women, that is, of Christian and religious women joined in marriage, hath, may be understood from this, that, when he was giving charge for the avoiding of fornication, wherein assuredly he was addressing married persons also, he saith, \"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?\"[fn-41-P4143_1952221:7-nf] So great then is the good of faithful marriage, that even the very members are (members) of Christ. But, forasmuch as the good of widowed continence is better than this good, the purpose of this profession is, not that a catholic widow be any thing more than a member of Christ, but that she have a better place, than a married woman, among the members of Christ.

For it cannot come to pass, that when the spirit is sanctified, the body also be not holy, of which the sanctified spirit maketh use: but, that we seem not to any to argue rather than to prove this by divine saying; since the Apostle Peter, making mention of Sarah, saith only \"holy women,\" and saith not, \"and in body;\" let us consider that saying of the same Paul, where forbidding fornication he saith, \"Know ye not, that your bodies are members of Christ?

Nor hath he said, \"If then ye have secular law-suits, bring them before us;\" or, \"Appoint us to judge them;\" but, \"Them which are contemptible in the Church, these,\" saith he, \"put ye in place.

Whence it is no where written of him that he on any occasion gave up his time to such matters; from which we are not able to excuse ourselves, even though we be contemptible; because he willed even such to be put in place, in case there were lack of wise men, rather than have the affairs of Christians to be brought into the public courts. Which labor, however, we not without consolation of the Lord take upon us, for hope of eternal life, that we may bring forth fruit with patience. For we are servants unto His Church, and most of all to the weaker members, whatsoever members we in the same body may chance to be. I pass by other innumerable ecclesiastical cares, which perchance no man credits but he who hath experienced the same. Therefore we do not bind heavy burdens and place them on your shoulders, while we ourselves touch them not so much as with a finger; since indeed if with safety to our office we might, (He seeth it, Who tries our hearts!) we would rather do these things which we exhort you to do, than the things which we ourselves are forced to do.

For they would argue that servants and companions possess a discretion in discharging the functions of their respective office, and a power over their will in both relations: in short, (they would claim to be) men themselves, and therefore (would expect) to share the credit with their principals, to whom they voluntarily yielded their assistance; whereas the flesh had no discretion, no sentiment in itself, but possessing no power of its own of willing or refusing, it, in fact, appears to stand to the soul in the stead of a vessel as an instrument rather than a servant. The soul alone, therefore, will have to be judged (at the last day) pre-eminently as to how it has employed the vessel of the flesh; the vessel itself, of course, not being amenable to a judicial award: for who condemns the cup if any. man has mixed poison in it? or who sentences the sword to the beasts, if a man has perpetrated with it the atrocities of a brigand? Well, now, we will grant that the flesh is innocent, in so far as bad actions will not be charged upon it: what, then, is there to hinder its being saved on the score of its innocence? For although it is free from all imputation of good works, as it is of evil ones, yet it is more consistent with the divine goodness to deliver the innocent. A beneficent man, indeed, is bound to do so: it suits then the character of the Most Bountiful to bestow even gratuitously such a favour. And yet, as to the cup, I will not take the poisoned one, into which some certain death is injected, but one which has been infected with the breath of a lascivious woman,[fn-98-P9818_2706399:91-nf] or of Cybele's priest, or of a gladiator, or of a hangman: then I want to know whether you would pass a milder condemnation on it than on the kisses of such persons? One indeed which is soiled with our own filth, or one which is not mingled to our own mind we are apt to dash to pieces, and then to increase our anger with our servant. As for the sword, which is drunk with the blood of the brigand's victims, who would not banish it entirely from his house, much more from his bed-room, or from his pillow, from the presumption that he would be sure to dream of nothing but the apparitions of the souls which were pursuing and disquieting him for lying down with the blade which shed their own blood? Take, however, the cup which has no reproach on it, and which deserves the credit of a faithful ministration, it will be adorned by its drinking-master with chaplets, or be honoured with a handful of flowers. The sword also which has received honourable stains in war, and has been thus engaged in a better manslaughter, will secure its own praise by consecration. It is quite possible, then, to pass decisive sentences even on vessels and on instruments, that so they too may participate in the merits of their proprietors and employers. Thus much do I say from a desire to meet even this argument, although there is a failure in the example, owing to the diversity in the nature of the objects. For every vessel or every instrument becomes useful from without, consisting as it does of material perfectly extraneous to the substance of the human owner or employer; whereas the flesh, being conceived, formed, and generated along with the soul from its earliest existence in the womb, is mixed up with it likewise in all its operations. For although it is called \"a vessel\" by the apostle, such as he enjoins to be treated \"with honour,\"[fn-98-P9819_2708279:92-nf] it is yet designated by the same apostle as \"the outward man,\"[fn-98-P9820_2708363:93-nf] -that clay, of course, which at the first was inscribed with the title of a man, not of a cup or a sword, or any paltry vessel. Now it is called a \"vessel\" in consideration of its capacity, whereby it receives and contains the soul; but \"man,\" from its community of nature, which renders it in all operations a servant and not an instrument. Accordingly, in the judgment it will be held to be a servant (even though it may have no independent discretion of its own), on the ground of its being an integral portion of that which possesses such discretion, and is not a mere chattel. And although the apostle is well aware that the flesh does nothing of itself which is not also imputed to the soul, he yet deems the flesh to be \"sinful; \"[fn-98-P9821_2709121:94-nf] lest it should be supposed to be free from all responsibility by the mere fact of its seeming to be impelled by the soul. So, again, when he is ascribing certain praiseworthy actions to the flesh, he says, \"Therefore glorify and exalt God in your body,\"[fn-98-P9822_2709394:95-nf] -being certain that such efforts are actuated by the soul; but still he ascribes them to the flesh, because it is to it that he also promises the recompense. Besides, neither rebuke, (on the one hand), would have been suitable to it, if free from blame; nor, (on the other hand), would exhortation, if it were incapable of glory.

What advantage is it to them, that in the praise of the creature they say \"that the good God is the maker of those that are born, by whom all things were made, and that the children of men are His work,\" whom the Manicheans say are the work of the prince of darkness; when between them both, or among them both, God's creation, which is in infants, is perishing? For both of them refuse to have it delivered by Christ's flesh and blood,-the one, because they destroy that very flesh and blood, as if He did not take upon Him these at all in man or of man; and the other, because they assert that there is no evil in infants from which they should be delivered by the sacrament of this flesh and blood. Between them lies the human creature in infants, with a good origination, with a corrupted propagation, confessing for its goods a most excellent Creator, seeking for its evils a most merciful Redeemer, having the Manicheans as disparagers of its benefits, having the Pelagians as deniers of its evils, and both as persecutors. And although in infancy there is no power to speak, yet with its silent look and its hidden weakness it addresses the impious vanity of both, saying to the one, \"Believe that I am created by Him who creates good things;\" and saying to the other, \"Suffer me to be healed by Him who created me.\" The Manicheans say, \"There is nothing of this infant save the good soul to be delivered; the rest,\" which belongs not to the good God, but to tile prince of darkness, \"is to be rejected.\"' The Pelagians say, \"Certainly there is nothing of this infant to be delivered, because we have shown the whole to be safe.\" Both lie; but now the accuser of the flesh alone is more bearable than the praiser, who is convicted of cruelty against the whole.

The Only-begotten of God, therefore, through whom, as the previous course of the discussion has shown, all things were made, visible and invisible, according to the view of Scripture, both made all things, and loves what He made. For since He is Himself the invisible image of the invisible God, He conveyed invisibly a share in Himself to all His rational creatures, so that each one obtained a part of Him exactly proportioned to the amount of affection with which he regarded Him. But since, agreeably to the faculty of free-will, variety and diversity characterized the individual souls, so that one was attached with a warmer love to the Author of its being, and another with a feebler and weaker regard, that soul (anima) regarding which Jesus said, \"No one shall take my life (animam) from me,\"[fn-65-P6587_1318624:82-nf] inhering, from the beginning of the creation, and afterwards, inseparably and indissolubly in Him, as being the Wisdom and Word of God, and the Truth and the true Light, and receiving Him wholly, and passing into His light and splendour, was made with Him in a pre-eminent degree[fn-65-P6588_1319191:83-nf] one spirit, according to the promise of the apostle to those who ought to imitate it, that \"he who is joined in the Lord is one spirit.\"[fn-65-P6589_1319348:84-nf] This substance of a soul, then, being intermediate between God and the flesh-it being impossible for the nature of God to intermingle with a body without an intermediate instrument-the God-man is born, as we have said, that substance being the intermediary to whose nature it was not contrary to assume a body. But neither, on the other hand, was it opposed to the nature of that soul, as a rational existence, to receive God, into whom, as stated above, as into the Word, and the Wisdom, and the Truth, it had already wholly entered. And therefore deservedly is it also called, along with the flesh which it had assumed, the Son of God, and the Power of God, the Christ, and the Wisdom of God, either because it was wholly in the Son of God, or because it received the Son of God wholly into itself. And again, the Son of God, through whom all things were created, is named Jesus Christ and the Son of man. For the Son of God also is said to have died-in reference, viz., to that nature which could admit of death; and He is called the Son of man, who is announced as about to come in the glory of God the Father, with the holy angels. And for this reason, throughout the whole of Scripture, not only is the divine nature spoken of in human words, but the human nature is adorned by appellations of divine dignity. More truly indeed of this than of any other can the statement be affirmed, \"They shall both be in one flesh, and are no longer two, but one flesh.\"[fn-65-P6590_1320832:85-nf] For the Word of God is to be considered as being more in one flesh with the soul than a man with his wife.

For in these and other precepts of the Lord the faithful are distinguished, and the unfaithful at the same time disapproved. For these are rather to be borne with by the faithful than made subjects of reproach (exprobrandi); just as there is chaff with the wheat even to the last winnowing, and as there are bad fish with good even on to their separation, which is yet to be on the shore,-that is to say, at the end of the world. By no means, then, can that man be condemned by a human examination, whom God has reserved for His own judgment, that the purpose of God, according to which He has decreed to save what had perished, may be unalterable. And consequently, as His will suffers no change, let no man presume on matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of that word which the apostle speaks: \"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? \"[fn-92-P9240_3009696:13-nf] To this, too, our Lord's word may refer: \"And if any man will take away thy coat, and sue thee at the law, let him have thy cloak also.\"[fn-92-P9241_3009852:14-nf] And in another place: \"Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.\"[fn-92-P9242_3009949:15-nf] Moreover, there are certain things which might be thought most trivial were they not shown in the Scriptures to be of more serious import. Who would ever consider the man who says to his brother \"Thou fool\" worthy of hell-fire, were it not that the Truth Himself told us so?[fn-92-P9243_3010242:16-nf] Those, furthermore, who commit those sins whereof the apostle says, \"They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-92-P9244_3010392:17-nf] are by all means to be guarded against, and are to be compelled to seek amendment if they do not choose it voluntarily, because they are marked with the stains of infamy, and go down into the pit, unless assistance is brought them by sacerdotal authority. Those also are to be dealt with in like manner of whom he says, \"With such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9245_3010767:18-nf] because such persons are branded with infamy until they are restored by sacerdotal authority, and reinstated in the bosom of our holy mother the Church; since those who are outside us cannot communicate with us. And it is manifest that these are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not lawful for us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all persons who underlie the charge of any manner of turpitude and dishonour, are rendered infamous; and all who arm themselves against fathers are rendered infamous. \"Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious.\"[fn-92-P9246_3011440:19-nf] \"He that wanteth understanding thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and erring man imagineth follies.\"[fn-92-P9247_3011568:20-nf] For their suspicion has overthrown many, and their opinion hath held them in vanity. \"A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. A heart that entereth two ways shall not have rest; and the evil heart in them shall be made to stumble. A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the sinner shall heap sin upon sin.\"[fn-92-P9248_3011960:21-nf] The holy apostles and their successors, having such things in mind, and foreseeing, as being filled with the Holy Spirit, the course of wicked men, and having regard to the simple, determined that the accusing of priests should be a matter undertaken with difficulty, or never undertaken, that they might not be ruined or displaced by wicked men. For if this were made an easy matter to secular and wicked men, there would remain no one, or but the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has been and still is the case-and (which is yet worse) that too in growing measure-that the wicked persecute the good, and that the carnal are hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has been already said, they decreed that such should not be accused at all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such should be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has been stated above, by what persons that function should not be assumed; and they resolved further, that bishops should not be cast out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way the matter of accusation should be taken in hand before their rightful seat and all their property are restored by those laws, they should by no means be accused or criminated by any one, and should not answer any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of their own accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted, and have had all their effects restored to them by those laws, when their affairs are arranged and set in order, they should then have a long period allowed them for the disposing of their case; and thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come to the suit; and if the matter seem just, they should answer the propositions of their accusers with the help of their brethren. For so long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that any charge ought to be preferred against them. And no one is at liberty by any means to bring any charge against them, whether superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their churches, effects, or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and we too confirm the same statutes and hereby decree, that if any one among the clergy proves an enemy or traducer of his bishops, and seeks to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the consideration of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the clerical order, and given over to the court (curioe), to which he shall devote himself zealously all the days of his life, and shall remain infamous without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume to be at once accuser, and judge, or witness; for in every judicial investigation there must always be four persons present: that is, the judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and the witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority, that the flock should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor, to whose care they had been consigned, unless he falls into error in the faith; for the deeds of superiors are not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth; neither can the disciple be above the master, as the voice of Truth saith, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.\"[fn-92-P9249_3015358:22-nf] ","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_47_on_repentance_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Moreover, man's fear[fn-113-P11350_3220657:64-nf] is an honour to God.

Hear it also in the following way. The flesh figuratively represents to us the Holy Spirit; for the flesh was created by Him. The blood points out to us the Word, for as rich blood the Word has been infused into life; and the union of both is the Lord, the food of the babes-the Lord who is Spirit and Word. The food-that is, the Lord Jesus-that is, the Word of God, the Spirit made flesh, the heavenly flesh sanctified. The nutriment is the milk of the Father, by which alone we infants are nourished. The Word Himself, then, the beloved One, and our nourisher, hath shed His own blood for us, to save humanity; and by Him, we, believing on God, flee to the Word, \"the care-soothing breast\" of the Father. And He alone, as is befitting, supplies us children with the milk of love, and those only are truly Messed who suck this breast. Wherefore also Peter says: \"Laying therefore aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and envy, and evil speaking, as new-born babes, desire the milk of the word, that ye may grow by it to salvation; if ye have tasted that the Lord is Christ.\"[fn-34-P3425_1038070:90-nf] And were one to concede to them that the meat was something different from the milk, then how shall they avoid being transfixed on their own spit, through want of consideration of nature?[fn-34-P3426_1038351:91-nf] For in winter, when the air is condensed, and prevents the escape of the heat enclosed within, the food, transmuted and digested and changed into blood, passes into the veins, and these, in the absence of exhalation, are greatly distended, and exhibit strong pulsations; consequently also nurses are then fullest of milk. And we have shown a little above, that on pregnancy blood passes into milk by a change which does not affect its substance, just as in old people yellow hair changes to grey. But again in summer, the body, having its pores more open, affords greater facility for diaphoretic action in the case of the food, and the milk is least abundant, since neither is the blood full, nor is the whole nutriment retained. If, then, the digestion of the food results in the production of blood, and the blood becomes milk, then blood is a preparation for milk, as blood is for a human being, and the grape for the vine. With milk, then, the Lord's nutriment, we are nursed directly we are born; and as soon as we are regenerated, we are honoured by receiving the good news of the hope of rest, even the Jerusalem above, in which it is written that milk and honey fall in showers, receiving through what is material the pledge of the sacred food. \"For meats are done away with,\"[fn-34-P3427_1039763:92-nf] as the apostle himself says; but this nourishment on milk leads to the heavens, rearing up citizens of heaven, and members of the angelic choirs. And since the Word is the gushing fountain of life, and has been called a river of olive oil, Paul, using appropriate figurative language, and calling Him milk, adds: \"I have given you to drink; \"[fn-34-P3428_1040126:93-nf] for we drink in the word, the nutriment of the truth. In truth, also liquid food is called drink; and the same thing may somehow be both meat and drink, according to the different aspects in which it is considered, just as cheese is the solidification of milk or milk solidified; for I am not concerned here to make a nice selection of an expression, only to say that one substance supplies both articles of food. Besides, for children at the breast, milk alone suffices; it serves both for meat and drink. \"I,\" says the Lord, \"have meat to eat that ye know not of. My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me.\"[fn-34-P3429_1040761:94-nf] You see another kind of food which, similarly with milk, represents figuratively the will of God. Besides, also, the completion of His own passion He called catachrestically \"a cup,\"[fn-34-P3430_1040965:95-nf] when He alone had to drink and drain it. Thus to Christ the fulfilling of His Father's will was food; and to us infants,who drink the milk of the word of the heavens, Christ Himself is food. Hence seeking is called sucking; for to those babes that seek the Word, the Father's breasts of love supply milk.","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_53_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For my part, I am sorry for this disease, while they are not ashamed to sing the praises of their delicacies, giving themselves great trouble to get lampreys in the Straits of Sicily, the eels of the Maeander, and the kids found in Melos, and the mullets in Sciathus, and the mussels of Pelorus, the oysters of Abydos, not omitting the sprats found in Lipara, and the Mantinican turnip; and furthermore, the beetroot that grows among the Ascraeans: they seek out the cockles of Methymna, the turbots of Attica, and the thrushes of Daphnis, and the reddish-brown dried figs, on account of which the ill-starred Persian marched into Greece with five hundred thousand men. Besides these, they purchase birds from Phasis, the Egyptian snipes, and the Median peafowl. Altering these by means of condiments, the gluttons gape for the sauces. \"Whatever earth and the depths of the sea, and the unmeasured space of the air produce,\" they cater for their gluttony. In their greed and solicitude, the gluttons seem absolutely to sweep the world with a drag-net to gratify their luxurious tastes. These gluttons, surrounded with the sound of hissing frying-pans, and wearing their whole life away at the pestle and mortar, cling to matter like fire. More than that, they emasculate plain food, namely bread, by straining off the nourishing part of the grain, so that the necessary part of food becomes matter of reproach to luxury. There is no limit to epicurism among men. For it has driven them to sweetmeats, and honey-cakes, and sugar-plums; inventing a multitude of desserts, hunting after all manner of dishes. A man like this seems to me to be all jaw, and nothing else. \"Desire not,\" says the Scripture, \"rich men's dainties; \"[fn-37-P3713_1124578:1-nf] for they belong to a false and base life.

For \"meats are for the belly,\"[fn-37-P3715_1124979:3-nf] for on them depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence[fn-37-P3716_1125064:4-nf] some, speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape,[fn-37-P3717_1125165:5-nf] to pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapae. He says accordingly somewhere, \"When thou art called to a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest place; \"[fn-37-P3718_1126057:6-nf] and elsewhere, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper; \"and again, \"But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,\"[fn-37-P3719_1126200:7-nf] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further, \"A certain man made a great supper, and called many.\"[fn-37-P3720_1126338:8-nf] But I perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: \"from the gullets and furious love for suppers\"-according to the comic poet. For, in truth, \"to many, many things are on account of the supper.\" For they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. \"It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.\"[fn-37-P3721_1127286:9-nf] \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-37-P3722_1127368:10-nf] But the hardest of all cases is for charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that is to be done away with? \"For if,\" it is said, \"I bestow all my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.\"[fn-37-P3723_1127680:11-nf] On this love alone depend the law and the Word; and if \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour,\" this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. \"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,\" says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as ephemeral, \"but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3724_1128287:12-nf] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is communication. \"And the care of discipline is love,\" as Wisdom says; \"and love is the keeping of the law.\"[fn-37-P3725_1128634:13-nf] And these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper. But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, \"Let the children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe on Thee.\"[fn-37-P3726_1129036:14-nf] \"For the righteous shall not live by bread.\"[fn-37-P3727_1129101:15-nf] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point which is beyond the sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for communication; having as its rich provision sufficiency, which, presiding over diet measured in due quantity, and treating the body in a healthful way, distributes something from its resources to those near us, But the diet which exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates his spirit, and renders his body prone to disease. Besides, those dainty tastes, which trouble themselves about rich dishes drive to practices of ill-repute, daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity, insatiability. Appropriate designations of such people as so indulge are flies, weasels, flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of parasites-the one class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and the other life, for the gratification of the belly; crawling on their bellies, beasts in human shape after the image of their father, the voracious beast. People first called the abandoneda0sw/touj, and so appear to me to indicate their end, understanding them as those who are (a0sw/souj) unsaved, excluding the j. For those that are absorbed in pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if they were not to live [hereafter]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah, denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love (agape), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word. \"But they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" And that He reckons such luxury to be sin, is shown by what He adds, \"And your sin shall not be forgiven you till you die,\"[fn-37-P3728_1130943:16-nf] -not conveying the idea that death, which deprives of sensation, is the forgiveness of sin, but meaning that death of salvation which is the recompense of sin. \"Take no pleasure in abominable delicacies, says Wisdom.[fn-37-P3729_1131184:17-nf] At this point, too, we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols, in order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them.

For nothing, most holy brethren, holds me bound with such bonds nothing stirs and arouses me with such a stimulus of care and anxiety, as the fear lest you should think that any disadvantage is suffered by you by reason of my absence; and this I strive to remedy, in labouring to show myself present with you by frequent letters.

But how perverse are the Jews, and remote from the understanding of their law, I have fully shown, as I believe, in two former letters,[fn-104-P10492_3308008:6-nf] wherein it was absolutely proved that they are ignorant of what is the true circumcision, and what the true Sabbath; and their ever increasing blindness is confuted in this present epistle, wherein I have briefly discoursed concerning their meats, because that in them they consider that they only are holy, and that all others are defiled.[fn-104-P10493_3308443:7-nf] ","title":"On the Jewish Meats.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_140_on_the_jewish_meats_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And thus there was a certain ancient time, wherein those shadows or figures were to be used, that meats should be abstained from which had indeed been commended by their creation, but had been prohibited by the law. But now Christ, the end of the law, has come, disclosing all the obscurities of the law-all those things which antiquity had covered with the clouds of sacraments. For the illustrious Master, and the heavenly Teacher, and the ordainer of the perfected truth, has come, under whom at length it is rightly said: \"To the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.\"[fn-105-P10519_3324091:21-nf] Moreover, in another place: \"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused which is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.\"[fn-105-P10520_3324289:22-nf] Again, in another place: \"The Spirit expressly says that in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by them which believe and those who know God.\"[fn-105-P10521_3324710:23-nf] Moreover, in another passage: \"Everything that is sold in the market-place eat, asking nothing.\"[fn-105-P10522_3324832:24-nf] From these things it is plain that all those things are returned to their original blessedness now that the law is finished, and that we must not revert to the special observances of meats, which observances were ordained for a certain reason, but which evangelical liberty has now taken away, their discharge being given. The apostle cries out: \"The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace. and joy.\"[fn-105-P10523_3325281:25-nf] Also elsewhere: \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.\"[fn-105-P10524_3325487:26-nf] God is not worshipped by the belly nor by meats, which the Lord says will perish, and are \"purged\" by natural law in the draught.[fn-105-P10525_3325638:27-nf] For he who worships the Lord by meats, is merely as one who has his belly for his Lord. The meat, I say, true, and holy, and pure, is a true faith, an unspotted conscience, and an innocent soul. Whosoever is thus fed, feeds also with Christ. Such a banqueter is God's guest: these are the feasts that feed the angels, these are the tables which the martyrs make. Hence is that word of the law: \"Man cloth not live by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"[fn-105-P10526_3326272:28-nf] Hence, too, that saying of Christ: \"My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.\"[fn-105-P10527_3326401:29-nf] Hence, \"Ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of my loaves and were filled.

For Zecharias also tells us, saying: \"If ye eat or drink, is it not ye that eat or drink? \"[fn-105-P10529_3326898:31-nf] -declaring thereby that meat or drink attain not unto God, but unto man: for neither is God fleshly, so as to be pleased with flesh; nor is He careful[fn-105-P10530_3327074:32-nf] for these pleasures, so as to rejoice in our food.[fn-105-P10531_3327186:33-nf] God rejoices in our faith alone, in our innocency alone, in our truth alone, in our virtues alone. And these dwell not in our belly, but in our soul; and these are acquired for us by divine awe and heavenly fear, and not by earthly food. And such the apostle fitly rebuked, as \"obeying the superstitions of angels, puffed up by their fleshly mind; not holding Christ the head, from whom all the body, joined together by links, and inwoven and grown together by mutual members in the bond of charity, increaseth to God; \"[fn-105-P10532_3327843:34-nf] but observing those things: \"Touch not, taste not, handle not; which indeed seem to have a form of religion, in that the body is not spared.\"[fn-105-P10533_3328007:35-nf] Yet there is no advantage at all of righteousness, while we are recalled by a voluntary slavery to those elements to which by baptism we have died.","title":"On the Jewish Meats.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-04","text":"[fn-80-P8052_1968913:27-nf] is considered to be a god when speaking, and making himself heard through the Pythian priestess; so, according to our view, it was the Logos God, and Son of the God of all things, who spake in Jesus these words, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; \"and these, \"I am the door; \"and these, \"I am the living bread that came down from heaven; \"and other expressions similar to these. We therefore charge the Jews with not acknowledging Him to be God, to whom testimony was borne in many passages by the prophets, to the effect that He was a mighty power, and a God next to[fn-80-P8053_1969517:28-nf] the God and Father of all things. For we assert that it was to Him the Father gave the command, when in the Mosaic account of the creation He uttered the words, \"Let there be light,\" and \"Let there be a firmament,\" and gave the injunctions with regard to those other creative acts which were performed; and that to Him also were addressed the words, \"Let Us make man in Our own image and likeness; \"and that the Logos, when commanded, obeyed all the Father's will. And we make these statements not from our own conjectures, but because we believe the prophecies circulated among the Jews, in which it is said of God, and of the works of creation, in express words, as follows: \"He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.\"[fn-80-P8054_1971146:29-nf] Now if God gave the command, and the creatures were formed, who, according to the view of the spirit of prophecy, could He be that was able to carry out such commands of the Father, save Him who, so to speak, is the living Logos and the Truth? And that the Gospels do not consider him who in Jesus said these words, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life,\" to have been of so circumscribed a nature[fn-80-P8055_1971570:30-nf] as to have an existence nowhere out of the soul and body of Jesus, is evident both from many considerations, and from a few instances of the following kind which we shall quote. John the Baptist, when predicting that the Son of God was to appear immediately, not in that body and soul, but as manifesting Himself everywhere, says regarding Him: \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not, who cometh after me.\"[fn-80-P8056_1972020:31-nf] For if he had thought that the Son of God was only there, where was the visible body of Jesus, how could he have said, \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not? \"And Jesus Himself, in raising the minds of His disciples to higher thoughts of the Son of God, says: \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of you.\"[fn-80-P8057_1972401:32-nf] And of the same nature is His promise to His disciples: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8058_1972536:33-nf] And we quote these passages, making no distinction between the Son of God and Jesus. For the soul and body of Jesus formed, after the oi0konomi/a, one being with the Logos of God. Now if, according to Paul's teaching, \"he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit,\"[fn-80-P8059_1972826:34-nf] every one who understands what being joined to the Lord is, and who has been actually joined to Him, is one spirit with the Lord; how should not that being be one in a far greater and more divine degree, which was once united with the Logos of God?[fn-80-P8060_1973095:35-nf] He, indeed, manifested Himself among the Jews as the power of God, by the miracles which He performed, which Celsus suspected were accomplished by sorcery, but which by the Jews of that time were attributed I know not why, to Beelzebub, in the words \"He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.\"[fn-80-P8061_1973696:36-nf] But these our Saviour convicted of uttering the greatest absurdities, from the fact that the kingdom of evil was not yet come to an end.

But the apostle says, among many other things, \"Neither the covetous, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-34-P3446_1960117:21-nf] For in another place the same apostle compares covetousness to the worship of idols: \"Nor covetous man,\" he says, \"who is an idolater;\"[fn-34-P3447_1960273:22-nf] which meaning the same Cyprian has so far extended in a letter to Antonianus, that he did not hesitate to compare the sin of covetousness with that of men who in time of persecution had declared in writing that they would offer incense.[fn-34-P3448_1960526:23-nf] The man, then, who is baptized in heresy in the name of the Holy Trinity, yet does not become the temple of God unless he abandons his heresy, just as the covetous man who has been baptized in the same name does not become the temple of God unless he abandons his covetousness, which is idolatry.

For, in writing to the Corinthians, the apostle enumerates the several sins, under each of which it is implicitly understood that it shall not inherit the kingdom of God: \"Be not deceived, he says: \"neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-35-P3589_2012742:118-nf] He does not say, those who possess all these vices together shall not inherit the kingdom of God; but neither these nor those: so that, as each is named, you may understand that no one of them shall inherit the kingdom of God.

And then, again, he proceeds to tell us the spiritual actions which vivify a man, that is, the engrafting of the Spirit; thus saying, \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, benignity, faith, meekness, continence, chastity: against these there is no law.\"[fn-90-P9034_2604114:80-nf] As, therefore, he who has gone forward to the better things, and has brought forth the fruit of the Spirit, is saved altogether because of the communion of the Spirit; so also he who has continued in the aforesaid works of the flesh, being truly reckoned as carnal, because he did not receive the Spirit of God, shall not have power to inherit the kingdom of heaven.

So, when this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O death, where is thy victory? \"[fn-90-P9069_2619910:101-nf] Now these words shall be appropriately said at the time when this mortal and corruptible flesh, which is subject to death, which also is pressed down by a certain dominion of death, rising up into life, shall put on incorruption and immortality. For then, indeed, shall death be truly vanquished, when that flesh which is held down by it shall go forth from under its dominion. And again, to the Philippians he says: \"But our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who shall transfigure the body of our humiliation conformable to the body of His glory, even as He is able (ita ut possit) according to the working of His own power.\"[fn-90-P9070_2620610:102-nf] What, then, is this \"body of humiliation\" which the Lord shall transfigure, [so as to be] conformed to \"the body of His glory? \"Plainly it is this body composed of flesh, which is indeed humbled when it falls into the earth. Now its transformation [takes place thus], that while it is mortal and corruptible, it becomes immortal and incorruptible, not after its own proper substance, but after the mighty working of the Lord, who is able to invest the mortal with immortality, and the corruptible with incorruption.

First, then, confess that you share in all the evil of Optatus, whom you knew, and even so reproach me with any evil which was found in those whom I knew not. And do not say to me, But my charges are serious, yours but trifling. You must first acknowledge them, however trifling they may be in your case, not before I on my side confess the charges against me, but before I can allow you to say these serious things about me at all. Did Optatus, whom you knew make you a thief by being your colleague, or not? Answer me one or the other. If you say he did not, I ask why he did not,-because he was not a thief himself? or because you do not know it? or because you disapprove of it? If you say, Because he himself was not a thief, much more ought we not to believe that those with whom you reproach us were of such a character as you assert. For if we must not believe of Optatus what both Christians and pagans and Jews, ay, and what both our party and yours assert, how much less should we believe what you assert of any one? But if you say, Because you do not know it, all the nations of the earth answer you, Much more do we not know of all that you reproach us with in these men. But if you say, Because you disapproved of it, they answer you with the same voice, Although you have never proved the truth of what you say, yet acts like these are viewed by us with disapproval. But if you say, Lo, Optatus, whom I knew, made me a thief because he was my colleague, and I was in the habit of going to the altar with him when he committed those deeds; but I do not greatly heed it, because the fault was trivial, but your party made you a traditor and a murderer,-I answer that I do not allow that I too am made a traditor and a murderer by the sins of other men, just because you confess that you are made a thief by the sin of another man; for it must be remembered that you are proved a thief, not by our judgment, but by your own confession. For we say that every man must bear his own burden, as the apostle is our witness.[fn-49-P4903_2413274:84-nf] But you, of your own accord, have taken the burden of Optatus on your own shoulders, not because you committed the theft, or consented to it, but because you declared your conviction that what another did applied to you. For, as the apostle says, when speaking of food, \"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean;\"[fn-49-P4904_2413720:85-nf] by the same rule, it may be said that the sins of others cannot implicate those who disapprove of them; but if any one thinks that they affect him, then he is affected by them. Wherefore you do not convict us of being traditors or murderers, even though you were to prove something of the sort against those who share the sacraments with us; but the guilt of theft is fastened on you, even if you disapprove of everything that Optatus did, not in virtue of our accusation, but by your own decision. And that you may not think this a trivial fault, read what the apostle says, \"Nor shall thieves inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-49-P4905_2414363:86-nf] But those who shall not inherit the kingdom of God will certainly not be on His right hand among those whom it shall be said, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" If they are not there, where will they be except on the left hand? Therefore among those to whom it shall be said, \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.\"[fn-49-P4906_2414820:87-nf] In vain, therefore, do you indulge in your security, thinking it a trivial fault which separates you from the kingdom of God, and sends you into everlasting fire. How much better will you do to betake yourself to true confusion, saying, Every one of us shall bear his own burden, and the winnowing fan at the last day shall separate the chaff from the wheat!","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":60,"source_paragraph":"304","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"140.

And why you have said this, and in what sense you have said it, I am wholly unable to perceive, unless it be that, whereas you had said above that all were condemned by the Lord who had broken any one of His commandments, you have considered since how many there are in your party who break not one but many of them; and lest an objection should be brought against you on that score, you have sought, by way of surpassing the difficulty, to bring in a distinction of sins, whereby it might be seen that it is one thing to break a commandment in respect of which pardon may easily be obtained, another thing to sin against the Holy Ghost, which shall receive no forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come. In your dread, therefore, of infection from sin, you were unwilling to pass this over in silence; and again, in your dread of a question too deep for your powers, you wish to touch cursorily on it in passing, in such a state of agitation, that, just as men who are setting about a task in haste, and consequent confusion, are wont to fasten their dress or shoes awry, so you have not thought fit either to see what belongs to what, or in what context or what sense the passage which you quote occurs. But what is the nature of that sin which shall not be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come, you are so far from knowing, that, though you believe that we are actually living in it, you yet promise us forgiveness of it through your baptism.

In short, how excellent that charity is, understand hence: the souls of many men are many, and if they love one another, it is one soul; still, in the case of men, they may be called many souls, because the union is not so strong. But there it is right for thee to say one God; two or three Gods it is not right for thee to say. From this, the supreme and surpassing excellency of charity is shown thee to be such, that a greater cannot be.","title":"Tractate XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_44_defence_of_his_flight","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"I Hear that Leontius[fn-43-P4334_1804779:1-nf] , now at Antioch, and Narcissus[fn-43-P4335_1804878:2-nf] of the city of Nero, and George[fn-43-P4336_1804925:3-nf] , now at Laodicea, and the Arians who are with them, are spreading abroad many slanderous reports concerning me, charging me with cowardice, because forsooth, when I myself was sought by them, I did not surrender myself into their hands.

Therefore, let the body of Christ bear at present, and tolerate the wickedness of evil livers. Let it, however, have righteousness now, for by righteousness it shall come to judgment. And what saith the Holy Scripture in the psalm to the members,-namely, that tolerate the wickedness of this world? \"The Lord will not cast off His people.\" For, in fact, His people labors among the unworthy, among the unrighteous, among blasphemers, among murmurers, detractors, persecutors, and, if they are allowed, destroyers.

And since you have already separated these from the number of sinners, it follows that you must shortly admit them into the ranks of the faithful and holy. For what kinds of sin do you say that those can commit, from which, if they are involved in them after the grace of baptism, they can be freed by the daily grace of Christ? or of what body of death are we to think that the Apostle said: \"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord\"?[fn-66-P6626_2368847:48-nf] Is it not clear, as truth compels you yourselves also to admit, that it is spoken not of those members of capital crimes, by which the wages of eternal death are gained; viz., murder, fornication, adultery, drunkenness, thefts and robberies, but of that body before mentioned, which the daily grace of Christ assists? For whoever after baptism and the knowledge of God falls into that death, must know that he will either have to be cleansed, not by the daily grace of Christ, i.e., an easy forgiveness, which our Lord when at any moment He is prayed to, is wont to grant to our errors, but by a lifelong affliction of penitence and penal sorrow, or else will be hereafter consigned to the punishment of eternal fire for them, as the same Apostle thus declares: \"Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor defilers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous persons, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God.\"[fn-66-P6627_2369874:49-nf] Or what is that law warring in our members which resists the law of our mind, and when it has led us resisting but captives to the law of sin and death, and has made us serve it with the flesh, nevertheless suffers us to serve the law of God with the mind? For I do not suppose that this law of sin denotes crimes or can be taken of the offences mentioned above, of which if a man is guilty he does not serve the law of God with the mind, from which law he must first have departed in heart before he is guilty of any of them with the flesh. For what is it to serve the law of sin, but to do what is commanded by sin? What sort of sin then is it to which so great holiness and perfection feels that it is captive, and yet doubts not that it will be freed from it by the grace of Christ, saying: \"O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord\"? What law, I ask, will you maintain to be implanted in our members, which, withdrawing us from the law of God and bringing us into captivity to the law of sin, could make us wretched rather than guilty so that we should not be consigned to eternal punishment, but still as it were sigh for the unbroken joys of bliss, and, seeking for a helper who shah restore us to it, exclaim with the Apostle: 'O wretched man that I am! Who shaft deliver me from the body of this death?\" For what is it to be led captive to the law of sin but to continue to perform and commit sin? Or what other chief good can be given which the saints cannot fulfil, except that in comparison with which, as we said above, everything else is not good? Indeed we know that many things in this world are good, and chiefly, modesty, continence, sobriety, humility, justice, mercy, temperance, piety: but all of these things fail to come up to that chief good, and can be done I say not by apostles, but even by ordinary folk; and, those by whom they are not done, are either chastised with eternal punishment, or are set free by great exertions, as was said above, of penitence, and not by the daily grace of Christ. It remains then for us to admit that this saying of the Apostle is rightly applied only to the persons of saints, who day after day falling under this law, which we described, of sin not of crimes, are secure of their salvation and not precipitated into wicked deeds, but, as has often been said, are drawn away from the contemplation of God to the misery of bodily thoughts, and are often deprived of the blessing of that true bliss. For if they felt that by this law of their members they were bound daily to crimes, they would complain of the loss not of happiness but of innocence, and the Apostle Paul would not say: \"O wretched man that I am,\" but \"Impure,\" or \"Wicked man that I am,\" and he would wish to be rid not of the body of this death, i.e., this mortal state, but of the crimes and misdeeds of this flesh. But because by reason of his state of human frailty he felt that he was captive, i.e., led away to carnal cares and anxieties which the law of sin and death causes, he groans over this law of sin under which against his will he had fallen, and at once has recourse to Christ and is saved by the present redemption of His grace. Whatever of anxiety therefore that law of sin, which naturally produces the thorns and thistles of mortal thoughts and cares, has caused to spring up in the ground of the Apostle's breast, that the law of grace at once plucks up. \"For the law,\" says he, \"of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath set me free from the law of sin and death.\"[fn-66-P6628_2373495:50-nf] ","title":"XXIII.

And the kind of fruit those have who thus love pleasures, he immediately describes, adding, `And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of Hosts, that this sin shall not be forgiven you until ye die[fn-91-P9144_3329363:14-nf] .' Yea, even while they live they shall be ashamed, because they consider their belly their lord; and when dead, they shall be tormented, because they have made a boast of such a death. To this effect also Paul bears witness, saying, `Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them[fn-91-P9145_3329696:15-nf] .' And the divine word declared before concerning them; `The death of sinners is evil, and those who hate the righteous commit sin[fn-91-P9146_3329847:16-nf] .'

The sentence of the Lord that it is unlawful to withdraw from wedlock, save on account of fornication,[fn-47-P4734_1466156:26-nf] applies, according to the argument, to men and women alike. Custom, however, does not so obtain. Yet, in relation with women, very strict expressions are to be found; as, for instance, the words of the apostle \"He which is joined to a harlot is one body\"[fn-47-P4735_1466429:27-nf] and of Jeremiah, If a wife \"become another man's shall be return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted?\"[fn-47-P4736_1466572:28-nf] And again, \"He that hath an adulteress is a feel and impious.\"[fn-47-P4737_1466653:29-nf] Yet custom ordains that men who commit adultery and are in fornication be retained by their wives.

If her reason is his living in fornication we do not find this in the custom of the church; but from an unbelieving husband a wife is commanded not to depart, but to remain, on account of the uncertainty of the issue. \"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shall save thy husband?\"[fn-47-P4739_1468431:31-nf] Here then the wife, if she leaves her husband and goes to another, is an adulteress.

If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit specially flora the following point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three creations. The first is the evolution from non-being into being.[fn-27-P2734_922103:72-nf] The second is change from the worse to the better. The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son. There is a bringing into existence of the heavens; and what says David? \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.\"[fn-27-P2735_922884:73-nf] Again, man is created through baptism, for \"if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.\"[fn-27-P2736_923038:74-nf] And why does the Saviour say to the disciples, \"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\"? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the Father and the Son. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.[fn-27-P2737_923451:75-nf] And He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.[fn-27-P2738_923553:76-nf] For what the holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? \"You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.\"[fn-27-P2739_923786:77-nf] Now every temple[fn-27-P2740_923823:78-nf] is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for \"He that built all things is God.\"[fn-27-P2741_924303:79-nf] If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shale worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.[fn-27-P2742_924490:80-nf] Supposing them to object to the word \"God,\" let them learn what this word means. God is called Qeo\\j either because He placed (teqeike/nai) all things or because He beholds (Qea=sqai) all things. If He is called Qeo\\j because He \"placed\" or \"beholds\" all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.[fn-27-P2743_924902:81-nf] Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God,[fn-27-P2744_925167:82-nf] then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For \"the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;\"[fn-27-P2745_925393:83-nf] and \"thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\"[fn-27-P2746_925532:84-nf] But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said \"if I by the finger of God cast out devils,\"[fn-27-P2747_925648:85-nf] of which the version in another Gospel is \"if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.\"[fn-27-P2748_925753:86-nf] So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_60_letter_xlii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3.
