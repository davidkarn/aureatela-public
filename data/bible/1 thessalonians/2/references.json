Avoid all persons to whom a suspicion of evil living may attach itself, and do not content yourself with the trite answer. `my own conscience is enough for me; I do not care what people say of me.' That was not the principle on which the apostle acted. He provided things honest not only in the sight of God but in the sight of all men;[fn-46-P4645_1259667:3311-nf] that the name of God might not be blasphemed among the Gentiles.[fn-46-P4646_1259774:3312-nf] Though he had power to lead about a sister, a wife,[fn-46-P4647_1259848:3313-nf] he would not do so, for he did not wish to be judged by an unbeliever's conscience.[fn-46-P4648_1259955:3314-nf] And, though he might have lived by the gospel,[fn-46-P4649_1260025:3315-nf] he laboured day and night with his own hands, that he might not be burdensome to the believers.[fn-46-P4650_1260145:3316-nf] \"If meat,\" he says, \"make my brother to offend.

It is better to lose a portion of one's substance than to imperil the salvation of one's soul. It is better to lose that which some day, whether we like it or not, must be lost to us and to give it up freely, than to lose that for which we should sacrifice all that we have. Which of us can add-I will not say a cubit for that would be an immense addition-but the tenth part of a single inch to his stature? Why are we careful what we shall eat or what we shall drink?

If I wish you then not to live with your mother, it is for the reasons given above, and above all for the two following.

Among the first he has set \"fornication, impurity, lasciviousness: \"\" (concerning) which I foretell you, as I have foretold, that whoever do such acts are not to attain by inheritance the kingdom of God.\"[fn-15-P1535_450537:189-nf] The Romans, moreover,-what learning is more impressed upon them than that there must be no dereliction of the Lord after believing? \"What, then, say we? Do we persevere in sin, in order that grace may superabound? Far be it. We, who are dead to sin, how shall we live in it still? Are ye ignorant that we who have been baptized in Christ have been baptized into His death? Buried with Him, then, we have been, through the baptism into the death, in order that, as Christ hath risen again from the dead, so we too may walk in newness of life. For if we have been buried together in the likeness of His death, why, we shall be (in that) of (His) resurrection too; knowing this, that our old man hath been crucified together with Him. But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall live, too, with Him; knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, no more dieth, (that) death no more hath domination over Him.

Let none seduce you with empty words: on this account cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of unbelief.\"[fn-15-P1554_455500:208-nf] Who \"seduces with empty words\" but he who states in a public harangue that adultery is remissible? not seeing into the fact that its very foundations have been dug out by the apostle, when he puts restraints upon drunkennesses and revellings, as withal here: \"And be not inebriated with wine, in which is voluptuousness.\"[fn-15-P1555_455857:209-nf] He demonstrates, too, to the Colossians what \"members\" they are to\"mortify\" upon earth: \"fornication, impurity, lust, evil concupiscence,\" and \"base talk.\"[fn-15-P1556_456029:210-nf] Yield up, by this time, to so many and such sentences, the one (passage) to which you cling.

Our Lord himself says,[fn-66-P6613_2070547:23-nf] \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" And in the same place, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" If you reply that this was said before the Passion, we certainly say after the Passion, in the Lord's prayer,[fn-66-P6614_2070948:24-nf] \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\" If we do not sin after baptism, why do we ask that we may be forgiven our sins, which were already forgiven in baptism? Why do we pray that we may not enter into temptation, and that we may be delivered from the evil one, if the devil cannot tempt those who are baptized? The case is different if this prayer belongs to the Catechumens, and is not adapted to faithful Christians. Paul, the chosen vessel,[fn-66-P6615_2071498:25-nf] chastised his body, and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate, and[fn-66-P6616_2071645:26-nf] he tells that there was given to him \"a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet\" him. And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy. But they to whom He says: \"Remember from whence thou art fallen \"; and, \"Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried\"; and, \"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is\"; and, \"Remember how thou hast received, and didst hear, and keep it, and repent,\" and so on, were of course believers, and baptized, who once stood, but fell through sin.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_103_letter_xlix_letter_to_dracontius_written_a_d_354_or_355_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4.

Accordingly, the word that sounds outwardly is the sign of the word that gives light inwardly; which latter has the greater claim to be called a word. For that which is uttered with the mouth of the flesh, is the articulate sound of a word; and is itself also called a word, on account of that to make which outwardly apparent it is itself assumed. For our word is so made in some way into an articulate sound of the body, by assuming that articulate sound by which it may be manifested to men's senses, as the Word of God was made flesh, by assuming that flesh in which itself also might be manifested to men's senses. And as our word becomes an articulate sound, yet is not changed into one; so the Word of God became flesh, but far be it from us to say He was changed into flesh, For both that word of ours became an articulate sound, and that other Word became flesh, by assuming it, not by consuming itself so as to be changed into it. And therefore whoever desires to arrive at any likeness, be it of what sort it may, of the Word of God, however in many respects unlike, must not regard the word of ours that, sounds in the ears, either when it is uttered in an articulate sound or when it is silently thought. For the words of all tongues that are uttered in sound are also silently thought, and the mind runs over verses while the bodily mouth is silent. And not only the numbers of syllables, but the tunes also of songs, since they are corporeal, and pertain to that sense of the body which is called hearing, are at hand by certain incorporeal images appropriate to them, to those who think of them, and who silently revolve all these things. But we must pass by this, in order to arrive at that word of man, by the likeness of which, be it of what sort it may, the Word of God may be somehow seen as in an enigma. Not that word which was spoken to this or that prophet, and of which it is said, \"Now the word of God grew and multiplied;\"[fn-19-P1983_1000529:43-nf] and again, \"Faith then cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ;\"[fn-19-P1984_1000625:44-nf] and again, \"When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men but, as it is in truth, the word of God\"[fn-19-P1985_1000788:45-nf] (and there are countless other like sayings in the Scriptures respecting the word of God, which is disseminated in the sounds of many and diverse languages through the hearts and mouths of men; and which is therefore called the word of God, because the doctrine thai is delivered is not human, but divine);-but we are now seeking to see, in whatsoever way we can, by means of this likeness, that Word of God of which it is said, \"The Word was God;\" of which it is said, \"All things were made by Him;\" of which it is said, \"The Word became flesh;\" of which it is said \"The Word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom.\"[fn-19-P1986_1001430:46-nf] We must go on, then, to that word of man, to the word of the rational animal, to the word of that image of God, that is not born of God, but made by God; which is neither utterable in sound nor capable of being thought under the likeness of sound such as must needs be with the word of any tongue; but which precedes all the signs by which it is signified, and is begotten from the knowledge that continues in the mind, when that same knowledge is spoken inwardly according as it really is. For the sight of thinking is exceedingly like the sight of knowledge. For when it is uttered by sound, or by any bodily sign, it is not uttered according as it really is, but as it can be seen or heard by the body. When, therefore, that is in the word which is in the knowledge, then there is a true word, and truth, such as is looked for from man; such that what is in the knowledge is also in the word, and what is not in the knowledge is also not in the word. Here may be recognized, \"Yea, yea; nay, nay.\"[fn-19-P1987_1002449:47-nf] And so this likeness of the image that is made, approaches as nearly as is possible to that likeness of the image that is born, by which God the Son is declared to be in all things like in substance to the Father. We must notice in this enigma also another likeness of the word of God; viz. that, as it is said of that Word, \"All things were made by Him,\" where God is declared to have made the universe by His only-begotten Son, so there are no works of man that are not first spoken in his heart: whence it is written, \"A word is the beginning of every work.\"[fn-19-P1988_1003029:48-nf] But here also, it is when the word is true, that then it is the beginning of a good work. And a word is true when it is begotten from the knowledge of working good works, so that there too may be preserved the \"yea yea, nay nay;\" in order that whatever is in that knowledge by which we are to live, may be also in the word by which we are to work, and whatever is not in the one may not be in the other. Otherwise such a word will be a lie, not truth; and what comes thence will be a sin, and not a good work. There is yet this other likeness of the Word of God in this likeness of our word, that there can be a word of ours with no work following it, but there cannot be any work unless a word precedes; just as the Word of God could have existed though no creature existed, but no creature could exist unless by that Word by which all things are made. And therefore not God the Father, not the Holy Spirit, not the Trinity itself, but the Son only, which is the Word of God, was made flesh; although the Trinity was the maker: in order that we might live rightly through our word following and imitating His example, i.e. by having no lie in either the thought or the work of our word. But this perfection of this image is one to be at some time hereafter. In order to attain this it is that the good master teaches us by Christian faith, and by pious doctrine, that \"with face unveiled\" from the veil of the law, which is the shadow of things to come, \"beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,\" i.e. gazing at it through a glass, \"we may be transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord;\"[fn-19-P1989_1004688:49-nf] as we explained above.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_21_homily_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Thus also Paul writing to the Thessalonians, saith, \"For ye became followers of the Churches of God, which are in Judea; for ye also have suffered the same things of your own fellow-countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have driven us out; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men.\"[fn-14-P1435_478452:44-nf] Which same point here also Christ hath established.","title":"Homily XV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_25_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"15.

Accordingly it remains that if we are to believe that the Lord Jesus, in this prayer, prayed for all of His own who either then were or should thereafter be in this life, which is a state of trial upon earth,[fn-35-P3525_1955083:14-nf] we must so understand the expression, \"through their word,\" as to believe that it here signified the word of faith itself which they preached in the world, and that it was called their word because it was primarily and principally preached by them. For it was already in the course of being preached by them in the earth when Paul received that same word of theirs by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whence also it came about that he compared the Gospel with them, lest by any means he had run, or should run, in vain; and they gave him their right hand because in him also they found, although not given him by them, their own word which they were already preaching, and in which they were now established.[fn-35-P3526_1955990:15-nf] And in regard to this word of the resurrection of Christ, it is said by the same apostle, \"Whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so ye believed;\"[fn-35-P3527_1956164:16-nf] and again, \"This is the word of faith,\" he says, \"which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-35-P3528_1956412:17-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles we read that in Christ, God hath marked out [the ground of] faith unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.[fn-35-P3529_1956585:18-nf] Accordingly, this word of faith, because principally and primarily preached by the apostles who adhered to Him, was called their word. Not, however, on that account does it cease to be the word of God because it is called their word; for the same apostle says that the Thessalonians received it from him \"not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God.\"[fn-35-P3530_1956977:19-nf] \"Of God,\" for the very reason that it was freely given by God; but called \"their word,\" because primarily and principally committed to them by God to be preached. In the same way also the thief mentioned above had in the matter of his own faith their word, which was called theirs precisely because the preaching of it primarily and principally pertained to the office they filled. And once more, when murmuring arose among the Grecian widows in reference to the serving of the tables, previous to the time when Paul was brought to the faith of Christ, the reply given by the apostles, who before then had adhered to the Lord, was: \"It is not good that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\"[fn-35-P3531_1957704:20-nf] Then it was that they provided for the ordination of deacons, that they themselves might not be drawn aside from the duty of preaching the word. Hence that was properly enough called their word which is the word of faith, whereby all, from whatever quarter they had heard it, believed on Christ, or, as yet to hear it, should thereafter believe. In this prayer, therefore, all whom He redeemed, whether then alive or thereafter to live in the flesh, were prayed for by our Redeemer when, praying for the apostles who were then with Him, He also conjoined those who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But what, after such conjunction, He then proceeds to say, must be reserved for discussion in another discourse.","title":"Tractate CIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"189","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"73. Both these counsels, therefore, must be accepted as having been spoken by the Lord to the apostles; namely, at once that they should not take a staff, and that they should take nothing save a staff only. For when He said to them, according to Matthew, \"Provide neither gold nor silver, nor money in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a staff,\" He added immediately, \"for the workman is worthy of his meat.\" And by this He makes it sufficiently obvious why it is that He would have them provide and carry none of these things. He shows that His reason was, not that these things are not necessary for the sustenance of this life, but because He was sending them in such a manner as to declare plainly that these things were due to them by those very persons who were to hear believingly the gospel preached by them; just as wages are the soldier's due, and as the fruit of the vine is the right of the planters, and the milk of the flock the right of the shepherds. For which reason Paul also speaks in this wise: \"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?\"[fn-18-P1802_737154:325-nf] For under these figures he was speaking of those things which are necessary to the preachers of the gospel. And so, a little further on, he says: \"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? If others are partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power.\"[fn-18-P1803_737532:326-nf] This makes it apparent that by these instructions the Lord did not mean that the evangelists should not seek their support in any other way than by depending on what was offered them by those to whom they preached the gospel (otherwise this very apostle acted contrary to this precept when he acquired a livelihood for himself by the labours of his own hands, because he would not be chargeable to any of them[fn-18-P1804_737968:327-nf] ), but that He gave them a power in the exercise of which they should know such things to be their due. Now, when any commandment is given by the Lord, there is the guiltof non-obedience if it is not observed; but when any power is given, any one is at liberty to abstain from its use, and, as it were, to recede from his right. Accordingly, when the Lord spake these things to the disciples, He did what that apostle expounds more clearly a little further on, when he says, \"Do ye not know that they who minister in the temple[fn-18-P1805_738519:328-nf] live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. But I have used none of these things.\"[fn-18-P1806_738776:329-nf] When he says, therefore, that the Lord ordained it thus, but that he did not use the ordinance, he certainly indicates that it was a power to use that was given him, and not a necessity of service that was imposed upon him.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I shall not be sorry to bestow attention on the shorter epistles also. Even in brief works there is much pungency?[fn-78-P7890_2246681:701-nf] The Jews had slain their prophets.[fn-78-P7891_2247367:702-nf] I may ask, What has this to do with the apostle of the rival god, one so amiable withal, who could hardly be said to condemn even the failings of his own people; and who, moreover, has himself some hand in making away with the same prophets whom he is destroying? What injury did Israel commit against him in slaying those whom he too has reprobated, since he was the first to pass a hostile sentence on them? But Israel sinned against their own God. He upbraided their iniquity to whom the injured God pertains; and certainly he is anything but the adversary of the injured Deity. Else he would not have burdened them with the charge of killing even the Lord, in the words, \"Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets,\" although (the pronoun) their own be an addition of the heretics.[fn-78-P7892_2248189:703-nf] Now, what was there so very acrimonious[fn-78-P7893_2248429:704-nf] in their killing Christ the proclaimer of the new god, after they had put to death also the prophets of their own god? The fact, however, of their having slain the Lord and His servants, is put as a case of climax.[fn-78-P7894_2248659:705-nf] Now, if it were the Christ of one god and the prophets of another god whom they slew, he would certainly have placed the impious crimes on the same level, instead of mentioning them in the way of a climax; but they did not admit of being put on the same level: the climax, therefore, was only possible[fn-78-P7895_2248991:706-nf] by the sin having been in fact committed against one and the same Lord in the two respective circumstances.[fn-78-P7896_2249139:707-nf] To one and the same Lord, then, belonged Christ and the prophets. What that \"sanctification of ours\" is, which he declares to be \"the will of God,\" you may discover from the opposite conduct which he forbids. That we should \"abstain from fornication,\" not from marriage; that every one \"should know how to possess his vessel in honour.\"[fn-78-P7897_2249502:708-nf] In what way? \"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles.\"[fn-78-P7898_2249599:709-nf] Concupiscence, however, is not ascribed to marriage even among the Gentiles, but to extravagant, unnatural, and enormous sins.[fn-78-P7899_2249749:710-nf] The law of nature[fn-79-P7900_2249788:711-nf] is opposed to luxury as well as to grossness and uncleanness;[fn-79-P7901_2249883:712-nf] it does not forbid connubial intercourse, but concupiscence; and it takes care of[fn-79-P7902_2250082:713-nf] our vessel by the honourable estate of matrimony. This passage (of the apostle) I would treat in such a way as to maintain the superiority of the other and higher sanctity, preferring continence and virginity to marriage, but by no means prohibiting the latter. For my hostility is directed against[fn-79-P7903_2250397:714-nf] those who are for destroying the God of marriage, not those who follow after chastity. He says that those who \"remain unto the coming of Christ,\" along with \"the dead in Christ, shall rise first,\" being \"caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.\"[fn-79-P7904_2250671:715-nf] I find it was in their foresight of all this, that the heavenly intelligences gazed with admiration on \"the Jerusalem which is above,\"[fn-79-P7905_2250833:716-nf] and by the mouth of Isaiah said long ago: \"Who are these that fly as clouds, and as doves with their young ones, unto me? \"[fn-79-P7906_2250977:717-nf] Now, as Christ has prepared for us this ascension into heaven, He must be the Christ of whom Amos[fn-79-P7907_2251094:718-nf] spoke: \"It is He who builds His ascent up to the heavens,\"[fn-79-P7908_2251303:719-nf] even for Himself and His people. Now, from whom shall I expect (the fulfil-merit of) all this, except from Him whom I have heard give the promise thereof? What \"spirit\" does he forbid us to \"quench,\" and what \"prophesyings\" to \"despise? \"[fn-79-P7909_2251562:720-nf] Not the Creator's spirit, nor the Creator's prophesyings, Marcion of course replies. For he has already quenched and despised the thing which he destroys, and is unable to forbid what he has despised.[fn-79-P7910_2251790:721-nf] It is then incumbent on Marcion now to display in his church that spirit of his god which must not be quenched, and the prophesyings which must not be despised. And since he has made such a display as he thinks fit, let him know that we shall challenge it whatever it may be to the rule[fn-79-P7911_2252193:722-nf] of the grace and power of the Spirit and the prophets-namely, to foretell the future, to reveal the secrets of the heart, and to explain mysteries. And when he shall have failed to produce and give proof of any such criterion, we will then on our side bring out both the Spirit and the prophecies of the Creator, which utter predictions according to His will. Thus it will be clearly seen of what the apostle spoke, even of those things which were to happen in the church of his God; and as long as He endures, so long also does His Spirit work, and so long are His promises repeated.[fn-79-P7912_2252793:723-nf] Come now, you who deny the salvation of the flesh, and who, whenever there occurs the specific mention of body in a case of this sort,[fn-79-P7913_2252947:724-nf] interpret it as meaning anything rather than the substance of the flesh, (tell me) how is it that the apostle has given certain distinct names to all (our faculties), and has comprised them all in one prayer for their safety, desiring that our \"spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord and Saviour (Jesus) Christ? \"[fn-79-P7914_2253356:725-nf] Now he has here pro-pounded the soul and the body as two several and distinct things.[fn-79-P7915_2253588:726-nf] For although the soul has a kind of body of a quality of its own,[fn-79-P7916_2255056:727-nf] just as the spirit has, yet as the soul and the body are distinctly named, the soul has its own peculiar appellation, not requiring the common designation of body. This is left for \"the flesh,\" which having no proper name (in this passage), necessarily makes use of the common designation. Indeed, I see no other substance in man, after spirit and soul, to which the term body can be applied except \"the flesh.\" This, therefore, I understand to be meant by the word \"body \"-as often as the latter is not specifically named. Much more do I so understand it in the present passage, where the flesh[fn-79-P7917_2255792:728-nf] is expressly called by the name \"body.\"","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_12_tractate_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"23. Already on a former occasion I have spoken of these ascending and descending angels; but lest you should have forgotten, I shall speak of the latter briefly by way of recalling it to your recollection. I should use more words if I were introducing, not recalling the subject. Jacob saw a ladder in a dream; and on a ladder he saw angels ascending and descending: and he anointed the stone which he had placed at his head.[fn-5-P552_247696:31-nf] You have heard that the Messias is Christ; you have heard that Christ is the Anointed. For Jacob did not place the stone, the anointed stone, that he might come and adore it: otherwise that would have been idolatry, not a pointing out of Christ. What was done was a pointing out of Christ, so far as it behoved such a pointing out to be made, and it was Christ that was pointed out. A stone was anointed, but not for an idol. A stone anointed; why a stone? \"Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be confounded.\"[fn-5-P553_248283:32-nf] Why anointed? Because Christus comes from chrisma. But what saw he then on the ladder? Ascending and descending angels. So it is the Church, brethren: the angels of God are good preachers, preaching Christ; this is the meaning of, \"they ascend and descend upon the Son of man.\" How do they ascend, and how do they descend? In one case we have an example; listen to the Apostle Paul. What we find in him, let us believe regarding the other preachers of the truth. Behold Paul ascending: \"I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago was caught up into the third heaven (whether in the body, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth), and that he heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\"[fn-5-P554_249044:33-nf] You have heard him ascending, hear him descending: \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal; as babes in Christ I have fed you with milk, not with meat.\"[fn-5-P555_249246:34-nf] Behold he descended who had ascended. Ask whether he ascended to the third heaven. Ask whether he descended to give milk to babes. Hear that he descended: \"I became a babe in the midst of you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-5-P556_249505:35-nf] For we see both nurses and mothers descend to babes, and although they be able to speak Latin, they shorten the words, shake their tongues in a certain manner, in order to frame childish endearments from a methodical language; because if they speak according to rule, the infant does not understand nor profit. And if there be a father well skilled in speaking, and such an orator that the forum resounds with his eloquence, and the judgment-seats shake, if he have a little son, on his return home he puts aside the forensic eloquence to which he had ascended, and in child's language descends to his little one. Hear in one place the apostle himself ascending and descending inthe same sentence: \"For whether,\" says he,\"we be beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. \"[fn-5-P557_250335:36-nf] What is \"we are beside ourselves \"? Thatwe see those things which it is not lawful for a man to speak. What is \"we are sober for your cause?

For this himself doth openly show in the second to the Corinthians, speaking of other Churches supplying his necessities. For he had come, as it appears, to so great indigence, that from distant Churches were sent supplies for his necessities, while yet from them among whom he was, he accepted nothing of that kind. \"Have I committed a sin, \"saith he, \"in humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the Gospel of God freely? Other Churches I despoiled, taking wages of them to minister unto you: and when I was present with you and wanted, to no man was I burdensome. For that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied, and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will keep myself. It is the truth of Christ in me, that this glory shall not be infringed in me in the regions of Achaia. Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. But what I do, I also mean to do, that I may cut off occasion from them which seek occasion, that wherein they glory they may be found as also we.\"[fn-45-P4576_2254878:37-nf] Of this occasion, therefore, which he here saith that he cuts off, he would have that understood which he saith in the former place, \"Neither for occasion of covetousness, God is witness.\" And what he here saith, \"In humbling myself that ye might be exalted:\" this in the first to the same Corinthians, \"I became to the weak as weak;\" this to the Thessalonians, \"I became small among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-45-P4577_2255338:38-nf] Now then observe what follows: \"So,\" saith he, \"being affectionately desirous of you, we are minded to impart unto you not alone the Gospel of God, but our own souls also; because ye are become most dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil, night and day working, that we might not burden any of you.\" For this he said above, \"When we might be burdensome to you, as Christ's Apostles.\" Because, then, the weak were in peril, lest, agitated by false suspicions, they should hate an, as it were, venal Gospel, for this cause, trembling for them as with a father's and a mother's bowels of compassion, did he this thing. So too in the Acts of the Apostles he speaks the same thing, when, sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he had called thence the presbyters of the Church, to whom, among much else, \"Silver,\" saith he, \"and gold, or apparel of no man have I coveted; yourselves know, that to my necessities and theirs who were with me these hands have ministered. In all things have I shown you that so laboring it behoveth to help the weak, mindful also of the words of the Lord Jesus, for that He said, More blessed is it rather to give than to receive.\"[fn-45-P4578_2256531:39-nf] 14. Here peradventure some man may say, \"If it was bodily work that the Apostle wrought, whereby to sustain this life, what was that same work, and when did he find time for it, both to work and to preach the Gospel?\" To whom I answer: Suppose I do not know; nevertheless that he did bodily work, and thereby lived in the flesh, and did not use the power which the Lord had given to the Apostles, that preaching the Gospel he should live by the Gospel, those things above-said do without all doubt bear witness. For it is not either in one place or briefly said, that it should be possible for any most astute arguer with all his tergiversation to traduce and pervert it to another meaning. Since then so great an authority, with so mighty and so frequent blows mauling the gainsayers, doth break in pieces their contrariness, why ask they of me either what sort of work he did, or when he did it? One thing I know, that he neither did steal, nor was a housebreaker or highwayman, nor chariot-driver or hunter or player, nor given to filthy lucre: but innocently and honestly wrought things which are fitted for the uses of men; such as are the works of carpenters, builders,shoemakers, peasants, and such like. For honesty itself reprehends not what their pride cloth reprehend, who love to be called, but love not to be, honest. The Apostle then would not disdain either to take in hand any work of peasants, or to be employed in the labor of craftsmen. For he who saith, \"Be ye without offense to Jews and to Greeks and to the Church of God,\"[fn-45-P4579_2258099:40-nf] before what men he could possibly stand abashed, I know not. If they shall say, the Jews; the Patriarchs fed cattle: if the Greeks, whom we call also Pagans; they have had philosophers, held in high honor, who were shoemakers: if the Church of God; that just man, elect to the testimony of a conjugal and ever-during virginity, to whom was betrothed the Virgin Mary who bore Christ, was a carpenter.[fn-45-P4580_2258519:41-nf] Whatever therefore of these with innocence and without fraud men do work, is good. For the Apostle himself takes precaution of this, that no man through necessity of sustaining life should turn aside to evil works. \"Let him that stole,\" saith he, \"steal no more; but rather let him labor good with his hands, that he may have to impart to him that needeth.\"[fn-45-P4581_2258898:42-nf] This then is enough to know, that also in the very work of the body the Apostle did work that which is good.","title":"Of the Work of Monks.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_37_of_the_work_of_monks_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"15.

God, therefore, worketh in the hearts of men with that calling according to His purpose, of which we have spoken a great deal, that they should not hear the gospel in vain, but when they heard it, should be converted and believe, receiving it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God.","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_45_homily_xxxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"(Recapitulation.)

And he who fulfils this commandment is in reality a child and a son to God and to the world,-to the one as deceived, to the other as beloved. And if we have one Master in heaven, as the Scripture says, then by common consent those on the earth will be rightly called disciples. For so is the truth, that perfection is with the Lord, who is always teaching, and infancy and childishness with us, who are always learning. Thus prophecy hath honoured perfection, by applying to it the appellation man. For instance, by David, He says of the devil: \"The Lord abhors the man of blood; \"[fn-33-P3361_1001079:37-nf] he calls him man, as perfect in wickedness. And the Lord is called man, because He is perfect in righteousness. Directly in point is the instance of the apostle, who says, writing the Corinthians: \"For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-33-P3362_1001382:38-nf] whether as children or saints, but to the Lord alone. And writing to the Ephesians, he has unfolded in the clearest manner the point in question, speaking to the following effect: \"Till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we be no longer children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, by the craft of men, by their cunning in stratagems of deceit; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up to Him in all things,\"[fn-33-P3363_1001938:39-nf] -saying these things in order to the edification of the body of Christ, who is the head and man, the only one perfect in righteousness; and we who are children guarding against the blasts of heresies, which blow to our inflation; and not putting our trust in fathers who teach us otherwise, are then made perfect when we are the church, having received Christ the head. Then it is right to notice, with respect to the appellation of infant (nh/pioj), that to\\ nh/pion is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called nhpu/tioj: and nh/pioj is neh/pioj (since he that is tender-hearted is calledh !pioj), as being one that has newly become gentle and meek in Conduct. This the blessed Paul most clearly pointed out when he said, \"When we might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, we were gentle (h !pioi) among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-33-P3364_1002835:40-nf] The child (nh/pioj) is therefore gentle (h !pioj), and therefore more tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy, straightforward and upright in mind, which is the basis of simplicity and truth. For He says, \"Upon whom shall I look, but upon him who is gentle and quiet? \"[fn-33-P3365_1003156:41-nf] For such is the virgin speech, tender, and free of fraud; whence also a virgin is wont to be called \"a tender bride,\" and a child \"tender-hearted.\" And we are tender who are pliant to the power of persuasion, and are easily drawn to goodness, and are mild, and free of the stain of malice and perverseness, for the ancient race was perverse and hard-hearted; but the band of infants, the new people which we are, i.s delicate as a child.

But if, which is rather the true sense, they themselves understand the designation children of simple ones, we glory in the name.

And thou, therefore, who hast undertaken to wage a complete combat[fn-16-P1654_1302525:76-nf] with the devil, think not to pursue a life without danger, and full of luxury! God hath not pledged to thee His recompense and His promise here; but everything that is splendid for thee in the future life! Be glad and rejoice then, if when thou hast thyself done any good action, thou receive the contrary, or if thou See another suffering this; inasmuch as this becomes to thee the source of a higher recompense! Do not be downcast: nor give up thy zeal, nor become the more torpid; but rather press onward with more eagerness; since even the Apostles, when they preached, although scourged, stoned, and constant inmates of the prisons, did not only after deliverance from dangers, but also in those very dangers, announce with greater forwardness the message of Truth. Paul is to be seen in prison, yea, even in chains, instructing and initiating:[fn-16-P1655_1303482:77-nf] and moreover doing the very same in a court of justice, in shipwreck, in tempest, and in a thousand dangers. Do thou too imitate these saints, and cease not from good works, so long as thou art able; and although thou seest the devil thwarting thee ten thousand times, never fall back! Thou perchance, bearing with thee thy wealth, hast met with shipwreck; but Paul carrying the word, far more precious than all wealth, was going to Rome, and was wrecked; and sustained innumerable hardships. And this he himself signified, when he said, \"Many times we desired to come unto you, but Satan hindered us.\"[fn-16-P1656_1304108:78-nf] And God permitted it; thus revealing the more abundantly His power, and showing that the multitude of things which the devil did, or prevented from being done, neither lessened nor interrupted the preaching of the Gospel. On this account Paul gave God thanks in all things; and knowing that he was himself thereby rendered more approved, he exhibited his exceeding forwardness on every occasion, letting none of these impediments prevent him!","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Both must therefore test themselves: the one, if he is qualified to speak and leave behind him written records; the other, if he is in a right state to hear and read: as also some in the dispensation of the Eucharist, according to[fn-48-P4850_1453610:10-nf] custom enjoin that each one of the people individually should take his part.

Ye remember, beloved, that of the epistles of John the apostle the last past remains to be handled by us and expounded to you, as the Lord vouchsafes. Of this debt then we are mindful: and ye ought to be mindful of your claim. For indeed this same charity, which in this epistle is chiefly and almost alone commended, at once maketh us most faithful in paying our debts, and you most sweet in exacting your rights. I have said, most sweet in exacting, because where charity is not, he that exacts is bitter: but where charity is, both he that exacts is sweet, and he of whom it is exacted, although he undertakes some labor, yet charity makes the very labor to be almost no labor, and light. Do we not see how, even in dumb and irrational animals, where the love is not spiritual but carnal and natural, with great affection the mother yields herself to her young ones when they will have the milk which is their right: and however impetuously the suckling rushes at the teats, yet that is better for the mother than that it should not suck nor exact that which of love is due? Often we see great calves driving their heads at the cow's udders with a force that almost lifts up the mother's body, yet does she not kick them off; nay, if the young one be not there to suck, the towing of the dam calls for it to come to the teats. If then there be in us that spiritual charity of which the apostle saith, \"I became small in the midst of you even as a nurse cherishing her young ones;\"[fn-45-P4558_2459615:1-nf] we love you the more when ye are exacting. We like not the sluggish, because for the languid ones we are afraid.

Let us now come back to the order which was interrupted; and what remains, holy brethren, receive ye with all attention.

For as the discussion on the difficulty of its perfection is put off for so long, let us meanwhile discourse briefly on the instruments of it. Who, I ask, could, however fervent he might be in spirit, relying on his own strength with no praise from men endure the squalor of the desert, and I will not say the daily lack but the supply of dry bread? Who without the Lord's consolation, could put up with the continual thirst for water, or deprive his human eyes of that sweet and delicious morning sleep, and regularly compress his whole time of rest and repose into the limits of four hours? Who would be sufficient without God's grace to give continual attendance to reading and constant earnestness in work, receiving no advantage of present gain? And all these matters, as we cannot desire them continuously without divine inspiration, so in no respect whatever can we perform them without His help. And that we may ensure that these things are not only proved to us by the teaching of experience, but also made still clearer by sure proof and arguments, does not some weakness intervene in the case of many things which we wish usefully to perform, and though the full keenness of our desire and the perfection of our will be not wanting, yet interfere with the wish we have conceived, so that there is no carrying out of our purpose, unless the power to perform it has been granted by the mercy of the Lord, so that, although there are countless swarms of people who are anxious to stick faithfully to the pursuit of virtue, you can scarcely find any who are able to carry it out and endure it, to say nothing of the fact that, even when no weakness at all hinders us, the opportunity for doing everything that we wish does not lie in our own power. For it is not in our power to secure the silence of solitude and severe fasts and undisturbed study even when we could use such opportunities, but by a chapter of accidents we are often very much against our will kept away from the salutary ordinances so that we have to pray to the Lord for opportunities of place or time in which to practise them. And it is clear that the ability for these is not sufficient for us unless there be also granted to us by the Lord an opportunity of doing what we are capable of (as the Apostle also says: \"For we wanted to come to you once and again, but Satan hindered us\"[fn-52-P5273_1898006:8-nf] ), so that sometimes we find for our advantage we are called away from these spiritual exercises in order that while without our own consent the regularity of our routine is broken and we yield something to weakness of the flesh, we may even against our will be brought to a salutary patience. Of which providential arrangement of God the blessed Apostle says something similar: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And He said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness:\" and again: \"For we know not what to pray for as we ought.\"[fn-52-P5274_1898630:9-nf] ","title":"XIII.

This has not escaped your observation, and you have done well in noting, and in acquainting me with, the position of affairs. But it is not easy to find fit men. While, then, we are desirous of having the credit that comes of numbers, and cause God's Church to be more effectively administered by more officers, let us be careful lest we unwittingly bring the word into contempt on account of the unsatisfactory character of the men who are called to office, and accustom the laity to indifference. You yourself know well that the conduct of the governed is commonly of a piece with that of those who are set over them. Perhaps therefore it might be better to appoint one well approved man, though even this may not be an easy matter, to the supervision of the whole city, and entrust him with the management of details on his own responsibility. Only let him be a servant of God, \"a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,\"[fn-47-P4789_1494930:3-nf] not \"looking on his own things,\"[fn-47-P4790_1494981:4-nf] but on the things of the most, \"that they be saved.\"[fn-47-P4791_1495050:5-nf] If he finds himself overweighted with responsibility, he will associate other labourers for the harvest with himself.

If, however, this course prove difficult, let us first do our best to appoint superintendents[fn-47-P4792_1495495:6-nf] to the small townships or villages which have of old been episcopal sees. Then afterwards we will appoint once more the [bishop] of the city. Unless we take this course the man appointed may prove a hindrance to subsequent administration. and from his wish to rule over a larger diocese, and his refusal to accept the ordination of the bishops, we may find ourselves suddenly involved in a domestic quarrel. If this course is difficult, and time does not allow, see to it that the Isaurian bishop is strictly kept within his own bounds by ordaining some of his immediate neighbours. In the future it will be reserved for us to give to the rest bishops at the proper season, after we have carefully examined those whom we ourselves may judge to be most fit.","title":"Letter CXC","author":"St. Basil"}]
