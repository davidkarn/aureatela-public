Envy always follows in the track of virtue: as Horace says, it is ever the mountain top that is smitten by the lightning.[fn-40-P4034_1086476:2891-nf] It is not surprising that I declare this of men and women, when the jealousy of the Pharisees succeeded in crucifying our Lord Himself. All the saints have had illwishers, and even Paradise was not free from the serpent through whose malice death came into the world.[fn-40-P4035_1086835:2892-nf] So the Lord stirred up against Paula Hadad the Edomite[fn-40-P4036_1086914:2893-nf] to buffet her that she might not be exalted, and warned her frequently by the thorn in her flesh[fn-40-P4037_1087057:2894-nf] not to be elated by the greatness of her own virtues or to fancy that, compared with other women, she had attained the summit of perfection. For my part I used to say that it was best to give in to rancour and to retire before passion. So Jacob dealt with his brother Esau; so David met the unrelenting persecution of Saul. I reminded her how the first of these fled into Mesopotamia;[fn-40-P4038_1087467:2895-nf] and how the second surrendered himself to the Philistines,[fn-40-P4039_1087548:2896-nf] and chose to submit to foreign foes rather than to enemies at home. She however replied as follows:- 'Your suggestion would be a wise one if the devil did not everywhere fight against God's servants and handmaidens, and did he not always precede the fugitives to their chosen refuges. Moreover, I am deterred from accepting it by my love for the holy places; and I cannot find another Bethlehem elsewhere. Why may I not by my patience conquer this ill will? Why may I not by my humility break down this pride, and when I am smitten on the one cheek offer to the smiter the other?[fn-40-P4040_1088151:2897-nf] Surely the apostle Paul says \"Overcome evil with good.\"[fn-40-P4041_1088242:2898-nf] Did not the apostles glory when they suffered reproach for the Lord's sake? Did not even the Saviour humble Himself, taking the form of a servant and being made obedient to the Father unto death, even the death of the cross,[fn-40-P4042_1088492:2899-nf] that He might save us by His passion? If Job had not fought the battle and won the victory, he would never have received the crown of righteousness, or have heard the Lord say: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken unto thee for aught else than this, that thou mightest appear righteous.\"[fn-40-P4043_1088799:2900-nf] In the gospel those only are said to be blessed who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake.[fn-40-P4044_1088962:2901-nf] My conscience is at rest, and I know that it is not from any fault of mine that I am suffering; moreover affliction in this world is a ground for expecting a reward hereafter.' When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach her to her face, she used to chant the words of the psalter: \"While the wicked was before me, I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good:\"[fn-40-P4045_1089387:2902-nf] and again, \"I as a deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth:\"[fn-40-P4046_1089505:2903-nf] and \"I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\"[fn-40-P4047_1089604:2904-nf] When she felt herself tempted, she dwelt upon the words in Deuteronomy: \"The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\"[fn-40-P4048_1089828:2905-nf] In tribulations and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: \"Ye that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope: yet a little while must these things be by reason of the malice of the lips and by reason of a spiteful tongue.\" This passage of scripture she explained for her own consolation as meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to receive hope upon hope. She recalled to mind also the words of the apostle, \"we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed\"[fn-40-P4049_1090606:2906-nf] and \"though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day\":[fn-40-P4050_1090709:2907-nf] and \"our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us[fn-40-P4051_1090790:2908-nf] an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.[fn-40-P4052_1091033:2909-nf] She used to say that, although to human impatience the time might seem slow in coming, yet that it would not be long but that presently help would come from God who says: \"In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.\"[fn-40-P4053_1091316:2910-nf] We ought not, she declared, to dread the deceitful lips and tongues of the wicked, for we rejoice in the aid of the Lord who warns us by His prophet: \"fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool\":[fn-40-P4054_1091661:2911-nf] and she quoted His own words, \"In your patience ye shall win your souls\":[fn-40-P4055_1091763:2912-nf] as well as those of the apostle, \"the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed? us\":[fn-40-P4056_1091932:2913-nf] and in another place, \"we are to suffer affliction\"[fn-40-P4057_1092012:2914-nf] that we may be patient in all things that befall us, for \"he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\"[fn-40-P4058_1092194:2915-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"150","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"52. But why get an unfair victory for our argument by fighting over these undignified questions, when it is within our power to prove that the excellence of the glory is beyond dispute by adducing more lofty considerations? If, indeed, we retreat what we have been taught by Scripture, every one of the Pneumatomachi will peradventure raise a loud and vehement outcry, stop their ears, pick up stones or anything else that comes to hand for a weapon, and charge against us. But our own security must not be regarded by us before the truth. We have learnt from the Apostle, \"the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ\"[fn-17-P1713_437265:451-nf] for our tribulations. Who is the Lord that directs into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ for tribulations? Let those men answer us who are for making a slave of the Holy Spirit. For if the argument had been about God the Father, it would certainly have said, `the Lord direct you into His own love,' or if about the Son, it would have added `into His own patience.' Let them then seek what other Person there is who is worthy to be honoured with the title of Lord. And parallel with this is that other passage, \"and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do towards you; to the end He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.\"[fn-17-P1714_438094:452-nf] Now what Lord does he entreat to stablish the hearts of the faithful at Thessalonica, unblamable in holiness before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord? Let those answer who place the Holy Ghost among the ministering spirits that are sent forth on service. They cannot. Wherefore let them hear yet another testimony which distinctly calls the Spirit Lord. \"The Lord,\" it is said, \"is that Spirit;\" and again \"even as from the Lord the Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1715_442465:453-nf] But to leave no ground for objection, I will quote the actual words of the Apostle;-\"For even unto this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which yell is done away in Christ. ... Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1716_443419:454-nf] Why does he speak thus? Because he who abides in the bare sense of the letter, and in it busies himself with the observances of the Law, has, as it were, got his own heart enveloped in the Jewish acceptance of the letter, like a veil; and this be-falls him because of his ignorance that the bodily observance of the Law is done away by the presence of Christ, in that for the future the types are transferred to the reality. Lamps are made needless by the advent of the sun; and, on the appearance of the truth, the occupation of the Law is gone, and prophecy is hushed into silence. He, on the contrary, who has been empowered to look down into the depth of the meaning of the Law, and, after passing through the obscurity of the letter, as through a veil, to arrive within things unspeakable, is like Moses taking off the veil when he spoke with God. He, too, turns from the letter to the Spirit. So with the veil on the face of Moses corresponds the obscurity of the teaching of the Law, and spiritual contemplation with the turning to the Lord. He, then, who in the reading of the Law takes away the letter and turns to the Lord,-and the Lord is now called the Spirit,-becomes moreover like Moses, who had his face glorified by the manifestation of God. For just as objects which lie near brilliant colours are themselves tinted by the brightness which is shed around, so is be who fixes his gaze firmly on the Spirit by the Spirit's glory somehow transfigured into greater splendour, having his heart lighted up, as it were, by some light streaming from the truth of the Spirit.[fn-17-P1717_445032:455-nf] And, this is \"being changed from[fn-17-P1718_445310:456-nf] the glory of the Spirit \"into\" His own \"glory,\" not in niggard degree, nor dimly and indistinctly, but as we might expect any one to be who is enlightened by[fn-17-P1719_445500:457-nf] the Spirit. Do you not, O man, fear the Apostle when he says\"Ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you\"?[fn-17-P1720_445654:458-nf] Could he ever have! brooked to honour with the title of \"temple\" the quarters of a slave?

But to those who are still babes in mind, and who as carnal, the apostle says, require to be nourished with milk, all discoursing on such a subject, wherein we deal not only with the believing, but also with the understanding and the knowing of what is spoken, must be burdensome, as being still unable to perceive such things, and be more fitted to oppress than to feed them. Whence it comes to pass that the spiritual, while not altogether silent on such subjects to the carnal, because of the Catholic faith which is to be preached to all, yet do not so handle them as, in their wish to simplify them to understandings that are still deficient in capacity, to bring their discourse on the truth into disrepute, rather than the truth that is in their discourse within the perceptions of their hearers. Accordingly in his Epistle to the Colossians he says: \"And though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and that which is lacking[fn-32-P3256_1815870:14-nf] in your faith in Christ.\"[fn-32-P3257_1816097:15-nf] And in that to the Thessalonians: \"Night and day,\" he says, \"praying more abundantly, that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.\"[fn-32-P3258_1816285:16-nf] Here we are, of course, to understand those who were under such primary catechetical instruction, as implied their nourishment with milk and not with strong meat; of the former of which there is mention made in the Epistle to the Hebrews of an abundant supply for such as nevertheless he would now have had to be feeding on solid food. Accordingly he says: \"Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us have regard to the completion; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of the baptismal font, and of the laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.\"[fn-32-P3259_1816976:17-nf] This is the copious supply of milk, without which even they cannot live, who have already indeed their reason sufficiently in use to enable them to believe, but who cannot distinguish good from evil, so as to be not only a matter of faith, but also of understanding (which belongs to the department of solid food). But when he includes doctrine also in his description of the milk, it is that which has been delivered to us in the Creed and the Lord's Prayer.","title":"Tractate XCVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_18_homily_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Let us now look over again what has been said. [\"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.\"] (Recapitulation, v. 23.) See the unostentatious conduct of the Apostles, and their largeness of mind. They did not go about boasting, and say, \"How we served (apexrhsameqa) the priests!\" nor were they ambitious of honor: but, we read, \"they came unto their own company. Observe how they do not cast themselves upon temptations, but when the temptations present themselves, with courage endure them. Had it been some other of the disciples, perhaps, emboldened by the countenance of the multitude, he might have insulted, might have vented ever so many harsh expressions. But not so these true philosophers; they do all with mildness and with gentleness. \"And when they heard that, we read, with one accord they lifted up their voice to God. (v. 24.) That shout proceeded from delight and great emotion. Such indeed are the prayers which do their work, prayers replete with true philosophy, prayers offered up for such objects, by such persons, on such occasions, in such a manner; whereas all others are abominable and profane. \"Lord, Thou the God that madest heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is.\" Observe how they say nothing idle, no old wives' talk and fables, but speak of His power. Just as Christ Himself said to the Jews, \"If I by the Spirit of God do cast out devils: behold the Father also speaks by the Spirit. For what saith it? \"Lord, the God Who,[fn-5-P599_438332:6-nf] by the Holy Ghost, through the mouth of our father Thy servant David didst say, Why did the nations rage?\" (v. 25.) Scripture is wont thus to speak of one as of many. \"For of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, Whom Thou didst anoint,[fn-6-P600_439445:7-nf] both Herod and Pontius Pilate, etc. (v. 27.) Observe how, even in prayer, they circumstantially describe the Passion, and refer all to God.-That is, Not they had power to do this: but Thou didst it all, Thou[fn-6-P601_439979:8-nf] that didst permit, that dost call to account, and yet didst bring to accomplishment, Thou the All-skilful and Wise, that didst serve Thee of Thine enemies for Thine own pleasure. (v. 28.) \"For to do whatever Thy hand,\" etc. Here they discourse of His exceeding Skill and Wisdom and Power. So then, as enemies they came together, and with murderous purpose, and as opposing themselves, but they did what things Thou wouldest: 'For to do,\" as it is said, \"whatsoever Thy hand and Thy purpose determined before to be done.\" What means, \"Thy hand?\" Here he seems to me to denote[fn-6-P602_440802:9-nf] one and the same thing by power and purpose, meaning that for Thee it is enough but to will: for it is not by power that one determines. \"Whatsoever Thy hand,\" etc. i.e. Whatsoever Thou didst ordain: either this is the meaning, or, that by His hand He did effect. \"And now, Lord, regard their threatenings.\" (v. 29.) As at that time, it is said, they \"imagined vain things,\" so \"now,\" grant that their imaginations may be in vain: i.e. let not their threatenings come into accomplishment. And this they said not because they would themselves deprecate any hardship, but for the preaching's sake. For they do not say, \"and deliver us out of dangers;\" but what? \"And grant unto Thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak Thy word.\" Thou Who didst bring to pass the former designs, bring these also to accomplishment. Observe,[fn-6-P603_442309:10-nf] how they affirm God to be the Author of their confidence; and how they ask all for God's sake, nothing for their own glory or ambition. They promise for their own part, that they will not be dismayed; but they pray that signs may be wrought \"by stretching forth Thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done:\" (v. 30) for without these, however great the zeal they showed, they would be striving to no purpose. God assented to their prayer, and manifested this, by shaking the place. For \"when they had prayed,\" it is said, \"the place was shaken. (v. 31.) And wherefore this was done, hear from the prophet, when he says, \"He looketh on the earth, and maketh it to tremble. (Ps. civ. 32.) For by this He made it manifest that He is present to their prayers. And again, another prophet saith, \"The earth was shaken, and did tremble at the presence of the Lord.\" (Ps. xviii. 7; lxviii, 8.) And God did this, both to make it more awful, and to lead them on to a courageous trust. \"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.\" They[fn-6-P604_443689:11-nf] gained increased boldness. As it was the beginning (of their work), and they had besought a sensible sign for their persuasion (proj to peisqhnai autouj)-but after this we nowhere find the like happening-therefore great was the encouragement they received. In fact, they had no means of proving that He was risen, save by miraculous signs. So that it was not only their own assurance (asfaleian) that they sought: but that they might not be put to shame, but that they might speak with boldness. \"The place was shaken,\" and that made them all the more unshaken. For this is sometimes a token of wrath, sometimes of favor and providence, but on the present occasion, of wrath. For[fn-6-P605_444876:12-nf] in those times it took place in an unusual manner. Thus, at the Crucifixion, the earth was shaken: and the Lord Himself says, \"Then there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places. (Matt. xxiv. 7.) But then the wrath of which it was a sign was against the adversaries: as for the disciples, it filled them with the Spirit. Observe, even the Apostles, after the prayer, are \"filled with the Holy Ghost.\" \"And[fn-6-P606_445934:13-nf] the multitudes of them that believed,\" etc. (v. 32.) Great, you perceive, is the virtue of this thing, seeing their was need of this (grace) even in that Company. For this is the foundation of all that is good, this of which he now for the second time makes mention, exhorting all men to the. contempt of riches: \"Neither[fn-6-P607_446577:14-nf] said any of them that aught of the things he possessed was his own,\" \"but they had all things common.\" For that this was in consequence not merely of the miraculous signs, but of their own purpose, is manifest by the case of Sapphira and Ananias. \"And with great power gave the Apostles witness,\" etc. (v. 33.) Not in word, but with power the Apostles exhibited their testimony of the Resurrection: just as Paul saith, \"And my preaching was not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with manifestation of the Spirit and of power.\" And it is not merely, With power, but, \"With great power.\" (1 Cor. ii. 4.) \"And great grace,\" it says, \"was upon them all; for neither was there any among them that lacked. (v. 34.) This is why the grace (was upon them all,) for that \"there was none that lacked:\" that is, from the exceeding ardor of the givers, none was in want. For they did not give in part, and in part reserve: nor yet in giving all, give it as their own. And they lived moreover in great abundance: they removed all inequality from among them, and made a goodly order. \"For as many as were possessors,\" etc. And with great respect they did this: for they did not presume to give into their hands, nor did they ostentatiously present, but brought to the Apostles' feet. To them they left it to be the dispensers, made them the owners, that thenceforth all should be defrayed as from common, not from private, property.[fn-6-P608_448229:15-nf] This was also a help to them against vain-glory. If this were done now, we should ire more pleasant lives, both rich and poor, nor would it be more pleasant to the poor than to the rich themselves. And if you please, let us now for awhile depict it in words, and derive at least this pleasure from it, since you have no mind for it in your actions. For at any rate this is evident, even from the facts which took place then, that by selling their possessions they did not come to be in need, but made them rich that were in need. However, let us now depict this state of things in words, and let all sell their possessions, and bring them into the common stock-in words, I mean: let none be excited, rich or poor. How much gold think you would be collected? For my part, I conjecture-for of course it is not possible to speak exactly-that supposing all here, men and women, to empty out their whole property, lands, possessions, houses,-for I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they sat at liberty,-perhaps ten hundred thousand pounds weight of gold would be the amount collected: nay, twice or thrice as much. For consider; at what number of \"juga\"[fn-6-P609_451967:16-nf] (yokes) is our city rated? How many (of the population) shall we say are Christians? shall we say an hundred thousand, and the rest Greeks and Jews? Then what thousands (of pounds)of gold would be collected! And what is the number of poor? I do not think more than fifty thousand. Then to feed that number daily, what abundance there would bet And yet if the food were received in common, all taking their meals together, it would require no such great outlay after all. But, you will ask, what should we do after the money was spent? And do you think it ever could be spent? Would not the grace of God be ten thousand fold greater? Would not the grace of God be indeed richly poured out? Nay, should we not make it a heaven upon earth? If, where the numbers were three thousand and five thousand, the doing of this thing had such splendid success, and none of them complained of poverty, how much more glorious would this be in so vast a multitude? And even of those that are without, who would not contribute?-But, to show that it is the living separately that is expensive and causes poverty, let there be a house in which are ten children: and the wife and the man, let the one work at her wool, the other bring his earnings from his outdoor occupation: now tell me, in which way would these spend most? by taking their meals together and occupying one house, or by living separately? Of course, by living separately. For if the ten children must live apart, they would need ten several rooms, ten tables, ten attendants, and the income otherwise in proportion. Is it not for this very reason, that where there is a great number of servants, they have all one table, that the expense may not be so great? For so it is, division always makes diminution, concord and agreement make increase. The dwellers in the monasteries live just as the faithful did then: now did ever any of these die of hunger? was ever any of them not provided for with plenty of everything? Now, it seems, people are more afraid of this than of falling into a boundless and bottomless deep. But if we had made actual trial of this,[fn-6-P610_455011:17-nf] then indeed we should boldly venture upon this plan (tou pragmatoj). What grace too, think you, would there not be! For if at that time, when there was no believer but only the three thousand and the five thousand: when all, throughout the world, were enemies, when they could nowhere look for comfort, they yet boldly entered upon this plan with such success; how much more would this be the case now, when by the grace of God there are believers everywhere throughout the world? What Gentile would be left? For my part, I think there would not be one: we should so attract all, and draw them to us? But yet if we do but make[fn-6-P611_455950:18-nf] fair progress, I trust in God that even this shall be realized. Only do as I say, and let us successfully achieve things in their regular order; if God grant life, I trust that we shall soon bring you over to this way of life.","title":"Homily XI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_18_homily_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Let us now look over again what has been said.

Observe how they do not cast themselves upon temptations, but when the temptations present themselves, with courage endure them. Had it been some other of the disciples, perhaps, emboldened by the countenance of the multitude, he might have insulted, might have vented ever so many harsh expressions. But not so these true philosophers; they do all with mildness and with gentleness. \"And when they heard that, we read, with one accord they lifted up their voice to God. (v. 24.) That shout proceeded from delight and great emotion. Such indeed are the prayers which do their work, prayers replete with true philosophy, prayers offered up for such objects, by such persons, on such occasions, in such a manner; whereas all others are abominable and profane. \"Lord, Thou the God that madest heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is.\" Observe how they say nothing idle, no old wives' talk and fables, but speak of His power. Just as Christ Himself said to the Jews, \"If I by the Spirit of God do cast out devils: behold the Father also speaks by the Spirit. For what saith it? \"Lord, the God Who,[fn-5-P599_438332:6-nf] by the Holy Ghost, through the mouth of our father Thy servant David didst say, Why did the nations rage?\" (v. 25.) Scripture is wont thus to speak of one as of many. \"For of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, Whom Thou didst anoint,[fn-6-P600_439445:7-nf] both Herod and Pontius Pilate, etc. (v. 27.) Observe how, even in prayer, they circumstantially describe the Passion, and refer all to God.-That is, Not they had power to do this: but Thou didst it all, Thou[fn-6-P601_439979:8-nf] that didst permit, that dost call to account, and yet didst bring to accomplishment, Thou the All-skilful and Wise, that didst serve Thee of Thine enemies for Thine own pleasure. (v. 28.) \"For to do whatever Thy hand,\" etc. Here they discourse of His exceeding Skill and Wisdom and Power. So then, as enemies they came together, and with murderous purpose, and as opposing themselves, but they did what things Thou wouldest: 'For to do,\" as it is said, \"whatsoever Thy hand and Thy purpose determined before to be done.\" What means, \"Thy hand?\" Here he seems to me to denote[fn-6-P602_440802:9-nf] one and the same thing by power and purpose, meaning that for Thee it is enough but to will: for it is not by power that one determines. \"Whatsoever Thy hand,\" etc. i.e. Whatsoever Thou didst ordain: either this is the meaning, or, that by His hand He did effect. \"And now, Lord, regard their threatenings.\" (v. 29.) As at that time, it is said, they \"imagined vain things,\" so \"now,\" grant that their imaginations may be in vain: i.e. let not their threatenings come into accomplishment. And this they said not because they would themselves deprecate any hardship, but for the preaching's sake. For they do not say, \"and deliver us out of dangers;\" but what? \"And grant unto Thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak Thy word.\" Thou Who didst bring to pass the former designs, bring these also to accomplishment. Observe,[fn-6-P603_442309:10-nf] how they affirm God to be the Author of their confidence; and how they ask all for God's sake, nothing for their own glory or ambition. They promise for their own part, that they will not be dismayed; but they pray that signs may be wrought \"by stretching forth Thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done:\" (v. 30) for without these, however great the zeal they showed, they would be striving to no purpose. God assented to their prayer, and manifested this, by shaking the place. For \"when they had prayed,\" it is said, \"the place was shaken. (v. 31.) And wherefore this was done, hear from the prophet, when he says, \"He looketh on the earth, and maketh it to tremble. (Ps. civ. 32.) For by this He made it manifest that He is present to their prayers. And again, another prophet saith, \"The earth was shaken, and did tremble at the presence of the Lord.\" (Ps. xviii. 7; lxviii, 8.) And God did this, both to make it more awful, and to lead them on to a courageous trust. \"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.\" They[fn-6-P604_443689:11-nf] gained increased boldness. As it was the beginning (of their work), and they had besought a sensible sign for their persuasion (proj to peisqhnai autouj)-but after this we nowhere find the like happening-therefore great was the encouragement they received. In fact, they had no means of proving that He was risen, save by miraculous signs. So that it was not only their own assurance (asfaleian) that they sought: but that they might not be put to shame, but that they might speak with boldness. \"The place was shaken,\" and that made them all the more unshaken. For this is sometimes a token of wrath, sometimes of favor and providence, but on the present occasion, of wrath. For[fn-6-P605_444876:12-nf] in those times it took place in an unusual manner. Thus, at the Crucifixion, the earth was shaken: and the Lord Himself says, \"Then there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places. (Matt. xxiv. 7.) But then the wrath of which it was a sign was against the adversaries: as for the disciples, it filled them with the Spirit. Observe, even the Apostles, after the prayer, are \"filled with the Holy Ghost.\" \"And[fn-6-P606_445934:13-nf] the multitudes of them that believed,\" etc. (v. 32.) Great, you perceive, is the virtue of this thing, seeing their was need of this (grace) even in that Company. For this is the foundation of all that is good, this of which he now for the second time makes mention, exhorting all men to the. contempt of riches: \"Neither[fn-6-P607_446577:14-nf] said any of them that aught of the things he possessed was his own,\" \"but they had all things common.\" For that this was in consequence not merely of the miraculous signs, but of their own purpose, is manifest by the case of Sapphira and Ananias. \"And with great power gave the Apostles witness,\" etc. (v. 33.) Not in word, but with power the Apostles exhibited their testimony of the Resurrection: just as Paul saith, \"And my preaching was not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with manifestation of the Spirit and of power.\" And it is not merely, With power, but, \"With great power.\" (1 Cor. ii. 4.) \"And great grace,\" it says, \"was upon them all; for neither was there any among them that lacked. (v. 34.) This is why the grace (was upon them all,) for that \"there was none that lacked:\" that is, from the exceeding ardor of the givers, none was in want. For they did not give in part, and in part reserve: nor yet in giving all, give it as their own. And they lived moreover in great abundance: they removed all inequality from among them, and made a goodly order. \"For as many as were possessors,\" etc. And with great respect they did this: for they did not presume to give into their hands, nor did they ostentatiously present, but brought to the Apostles' feet. To them they left it to be the dispensers, made them the owners, that thenceforth all should be defrayed as from common, not from private, property.[fn-6-P608_448229:15-nf] This was also a help to them against vain-glory. If this were done now, we should ire more pleasant lives, both rich and poor, nor would it be more pleasant to the poor than to the rich themselves. And if you please, let us now for awhile depict it in words, and derive at least this pleasure from it, since you have no mind for it in your actions. For at any rate this is evident, even from the facts which took place then, that by selling their possessions they did not come to be in need, but made them rich that were in need. However, let us now depict this state of things in words, and let all sell their possessions, and bring them into the common stock-in words, I mean: let none be excited, rich or poor. How much gold think you would be collected? For my part, I conjecture-for of course it is not possible to speak exactly-that supposing all here, men and women, to empty out their whole property, lands, possessions, houses,-for I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they sat at liberty,-perhaps ten hundred thousand pounds weight of gold would be the amount collected: nay, twice or thrice as much. For consider; at what number of \"juga\"[fn-6-P609_451967:16-nf] (yokes) is our city rated? How many (of the population) shall we say are Christians? shall we say an hundred thousand, and the rest Greeks and Jews? Then what thousands (of pounds)of gold would be collected! And what is the number of poor? I do not think more than fifty thousand. Then to feed that number daily, what abundance there would bet And yet if the food were received in common, all taking their meals together, it would require no such great outlay after all. But, you will ask, what should we do after the money was spent? And do you think it ever could be spent? Would not the grace of God be ten thousand fold greater? Would not the grace of God be indeed richly poured out? Nay, should we not make it a heaven upon earth? If, where the numbers were three thousand and five thousand, the doing of this thing had such splendid success, and none of them complained of poverty, how much more glorious would this be in so vast a multitude? And even of those that are without, who would not contribute?-But, to show that it is the living separately that is expensive and causes poverty, let there be a house in which are ten children: and the wife and the man, let the one work at her wool, the other bring his earnings from his outdoor occupation: now tell me, in which way would these spend most? by taking their meals together and occupying one house, or by living separately? Of course, by living separately. For if the ten children must live apart, they would need ten several rooms, ten tables, ten attendants, and the income otherwise in proportion. Is it not for this very reason, that where there is a great number of servants, they have all one table, that the expense may not be so great? For so it is, division always makes diminution, concord and agreement make increase. The dwellers in the monasteries live just as the faithful did then: now did ever any of these die of hunger? was ever any of them not provided for with plenty of everything? Now, it seems, people are more afraid of this than of falling into a boundless and bottomless deep. But if we had made actual trial of this,[fn-6-P610_455011:17-nf] then indeed we should boldly venture upon this plan (tou pragmatoj). What grace too, think you, would there not be! For if at that time, when there was no believer but only the three thousand and the five thousand: when all, throughout the world, were enemies, when they could nowhere look for comfort, they yet boldly entered upon this plan with such success; how much more would this be the case now, when by the grace of God there are believers everywhere throughout the world? What Gentile would be left? For my part, I think there would not be one: we should so attract all, and draw them to us? But yet if we do but make[fn-6-P611_455950:18-nf] fair progress, I trust in God that even this shall be realized. Only do as I say, and let us successfully achieve things in their regular order; if God grant life, I trust that we shall soon bring you over to this way of life.","title":"Homily XI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_18_homily_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Let us now look over again what has been said.

And they lived moreover in great abundance: they removed all inequality from among them, and made a goodly order. \"For as many as were possessors,\" etc. And with great respect they did this: for they did not presume to give into their hands, nor did they ostentatiously present, but brought to the Apostles' feet. To them they left it to be the dispensers, made them the owners, that thenceforth all should be defrayed as from common, not from private, property.[fn-6-P608_448229:15-nf] This was also a help to them against vain-glory. If this were done now, we should ire more pleasant lives, both rich and poor, nor would it be more pleasant to the poor than to the rich themselves. And if you please, let us now for awhile depict it in words, and derive at least this pleasure from it, since you have no mind for it in your actions. For at any rate this is evident, even from the facts which took place then, that by selling their possessions they did not come to be in need, but made them rich that were in need. However, let us now depict this state of things in words, and let all sell their possessions, and bring them into the common stock-in words, I mean: let none be excited, rich or poor. How much gold think you would be collected? For my part, I conjecture-for of course it is not possible to speak exactly-that supposing all here, men and women, to empty out their whole property, lands, possessions, houses,-for I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they sat at liberty,-perhaps ten hundred thousand pounds weight of gold would be the amount collected: nay, twice or thrice as much. For consider; at what number of \"juga\"[fn-6-P609_451967:16-nf] (yokes) is our city rated? How many (of the population) shall we say are Christians? shall we say an hundred thousand, and the rest Greeks and Jews? Then what thousands (of pounds)of gold would be collected! And what is the number of poor? I do not think more than fifty thousand. Then to feed that number daily, what abundance there would bet And yet if the food were received in common, all taking their meals together, it would require no such great outlay after all. But, you will ask, what should we do after the money was spent? And do you think it ever could be spent? Would not the grace of God be ten thousand fold greater? Would not the grace of God be indeed richly poured out? Nay, should we not make it a heaven upon earth? If, where the numbers were three thousand and five thousand, the doing of this thing had such splendid success, and none of them complained of poverty, how much more glorious would this be in so vast a multitude? And even of those that are without, who would not contribute?-But, to show that it is the living separately that is expensive and causes poverty, let there be a house in which are ten children: and the wife and the man, let the one work at her wool, the other bring his earnings from his outdoor occupation: now tell me, in which way would these spend most? by taking their meals together and occupying one house, or by living separately? Of course, by living separately. For if the ten children must live apart, they would need ten several rooms, ten tables, ten attendants, and the income otherwise in proportion. Is it not for this very reason, that where there is a great number of servants, they have all one table, that the expense may not be so great? For so it is, division always makes diminution, concord and agreement make increase. The dwellers in the monasteries live just as the faithful did then: now did ever any of these die of hunger? was ever any of them not provided for with plenty of everything? Now, it seems, people are more afraid of this than of falling into a boundless and bottomless deep. But if we had made actual trial of this,[fn-6-P610_455011:17-nf] then indeed we should boldly venture upon this plan (tou pragmatoj). What grace too, think you, would there not be! For if at that time, when there was no believer but only the three thousand and the five thousand: when all, throughout the world, were enemies, when they could nowhere look for comfort, they yet boldly entered upon this plan with such success; how much more would this be the case now, when by the grace of God there are believers everywhere throughout the world? What Gentile would be left? For my part, I think there would not be one: we should so attract all, and draw them to us? But yet if we do but make[fn-6-P611_455950:18-nf] fair progress, I trust in God that even this shall be realized. Only do as I say, and let us successfully achieve things in their regular order; if God grant life, I trust that we shall soon bring you over to this way of life.","title":"Homily XI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"147","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"94.

But a wicked life was far from that house, and was neither with Martha nor with Mary; and if it ever had been, it fled at the Lord's entrance. There remained then in that house, which had received the Lord, in the twowomen the two lives, both harmless, both praiseworthy; the one of labour, the other of ease;neither vicious, neither slothful. Both harmless, both, I say, praiseworthy: but one of labour, the other of ease: neither vicious, which the life of labour must beware of; neither slothful, which the life of ease must beware of. There were then in that house these two lives, and Himself, the Fountain of life. In Martha was the image of things present, in Mary of things to come. What Martha was doing, that weare now; what Mary was doing, that we hope for. Let us do the first well, that we may have the second fully. For what of it have we now? How far have we it? As long as we are here, how much of it is there that we have?For in some measure are we employed in it now, and ye too when removed from business, and laying aside domestic cares, ye meet together, stand, listen. In so far as ye do this, ye are like Mary. And with greater facility do ye do that which Mary doeth, than I who have to distribute. Yet if I say ought, it is Christ's; therefore doth it feed you, because it is Christ's. For the Bread is common to us all, of which I too live as well as you. \"But now we live, if ye, Brethren, stand fast in the Lord.\"[fn-53-P5362_2276639:9-nf] I would not that ye should stand fast in us, but in the Lord. \"For neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.\"[fn-53-P5363_2276826:10-nf] ","title":"Sermon LIV.
