{"verses":["For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to\nremain at Athens alone.","And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the\ngospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:","That no man should be moved in these tribulations:  for yourselves\nknow that we are appointed thereunto.","For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should\nsuffer tribulations:  as also it is come to pass, and you know.","For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your\nfaith:  lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you:  and our\nlabour should be made vain.","But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your\nfaith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always,\ndesiring to see us as we also to see you:","Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our\nnecessity and tribulation, by your faith.","Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.","For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy\nwherewith we rejoice for you before our God,","Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face\nand may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?","Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct\nour way unto you.","And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity\ntowards one another and towards all men:  as we do also towards you,","To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and\nour Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his\nsaints.  Amen."]}
