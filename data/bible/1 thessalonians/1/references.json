Whence is it that we are Christians? Through our faith, would be the universal answer. And in what way are we saved? Plainly because we were regenerate through the grace given in our baptism. How else could we be? And after recognising that this salvation is established through the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, shall we fling away \"that form of doctrine\"[fn-14-P1429_348065:228-nf] which we received? Would it not rather be ground for great groaning if we are found now further off from our salvation \"than when we first believed,\"[fn-14-P1430_348238:229-nf] and deny now what we then received? Whether a man have departed this life without baptism, or have received a baptism lacking in some of the requirements of the tradition, his loss is equal.[fn-14-P1431_348449:230-nf] And whoever does not always and everywhere keep to and hold fast as a sure protection the confession which we recorded at our first admission, when, being delivered \"from the idols,\" we came \"to the living Gods\"[fn-14-P1432_348688:231-nf] constitutes himself a \"stranger\" from the \"promises\"[fn-14-P1433_350280:232-nf] of God, fighting against his own handwriting,[fn-14-P1434_350348:233-nf] which he put on record when he professed the faith. For if to me my baptism was the beginningof life, and that day of regeneration the first of days, it is plain that the utterance uttered in the grace of adoption was the most honourable of all. Can I then, perverted by these men's seductive words, abandon the tradition which guided me to the light, which bestowed on me the boon of the knowledge of God, whereby I, so long a foe by reason of sin, was made a child of God? But, for myself, I pray that with this confession I may depart hence to the Lord, and them I charge to preserve the faith secure until the day of Christ, and to keep the Spirit undivided from the Father and the Son, preserving, both in the confession of faith and in the doxology, the doctrine taught them at their baptism.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"59. As we find both expressions in use among the faithful, we use both; in the belief that full glory is equally given to the Spirit by both. The mouths, how, ever, of revilers of the truth may best be stopped by the preposition which, while it has the same meaning as that of the Scriptures, is not so wieldy a weapon for our opponents,(indeed it is now an object of their attack) and is used instead of the conjunction and. For to say \"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy\"[fn-17-P1794_461640:512-nf] is precisely the same thing as to say Paul with Timothy and Silvanus; for the connexion of the names is, preserved by either mode of expression. The Lord says \"The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-17-P1795_461861:513-nf] If I say the Father and the Son with the Holy Ghost shall I make, any difference in the sense? Of the connexion of names by means of the conjunction and the instances are many. We read \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-17-P1796_462149:514-nf] and again \"I beseech you for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1797_462333:515-nf] Now if we wish to use with instead of and, what difference shall we have made? I do not see; unless any one according to hard and fast grammatical rules might prefer the conjunction as copulative and making the union stronger, and reject the preposition as of inferior force. But if we had to defend ourselves on these points I do not suppose we should require a defence of many words. As it is, their argument is not about syllables nor yet about this or that sound of a word, but about things differing. most widely in power and in truth. It is for this reason that, while the use of the syllables is really a matter of no importance whatever, our opponents are making the endeavour to authorise some syllables, and bunt out others from the Church. For my own part, although the usefulness of the word is obvious as soon as it is heard, I will nevertheless set forth the arguments which led our fathers to adopt the reasonable coarse of employing the preposition \"with.\"[fn-17-P1798_463328:516-nf] It does indeed equally well with the preposition \"and,\" confute the mischief of Sabellius;[fn-17-P1799_463444:517-nf] and it sets forth quite as well as \"and\" the distinction of the hypostases, as in the words \"I and my Father will come,\"[fn-18-P1800_463589:518-nf] and \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-18-P1801_463640:519-nf] In addition to this the proof it contains of the eternal fellowship and uninterrupted conjunction is excellent. For to say that the Son is with the Father is to exhibit at once the distinction of the hypostases, and the inseparability of the fellowship. The same thing is observable even in mere human matters, for the conjunction \"and\" intimates that there is a common element in an action, while the preposition \"with\" declares in some sense as well the communion in action. As, for instance;-Paul and Timothy sailed to MaCedonia, but both Tychicus and Onesimus were sent to the Colossians. Hence we learn that they did the same thing. But suppose we are told that they sailed with, and were sent with? Then we are informed in addition that they carried out the action in company with one another. Thus while the word \"with\" upsets the error of Sabellius as no other word can, it routs also sinners who err in the very opposite direction; those, I mean, who separate the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Son, by intervals of time.[fn-18-P1802_464907:520-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For the occasion, indeed, of claiming Divine grace even for the Gentiles derived a pre-eminent fitness from this fact, that the man who set up to vindicate CoWs Law as his own was of the Gentiles, and not a Jew \"of the stock of the Israelites.\"[fn-20-P2029_693529:2-nf] For this fact-that Gentiles are admissible to God's Law-is enough to prevent Israel from priding himself on the notion that \"the Gentiles are accounted as a little drop of a bucket,\" or else as \"dust out of a threshing-floor: \"[fn-20-P2030_693780:3-nf] although we have God Himself as an adequate engager and faithful promiser, in that He promised to Abraham that \"in his seed should be blest all nations of the earth; \"[fn-20-P2031_694109:4-nf] and that[fn-20-P2032_694198:5-nf] out of the womb of Rebecca \"two peoples and two nations were about to proceed,\"[fn-20-P2033_694469:6-nf] -of course those of the Jews, that is, of Israel; and of the Gentiles, that is ours. Each, then, was called a people and a nation; lest, from the nuncupative appellation, any should dare to claim for himself the privilege of grace. For God ordained \"two peoples and two nations\" as about to proceed out of the womb of one woman: nor did grace[fn-20-P2034_694863:7-nf] make distinction in the nuncupative appellation, but in the order of birth; to the effect that, which ever was to be prior in proceeding from the womb, should be subjected to \"the less,\" that is, the posterior. For thus unto Rebecca did God speak: \"Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided from thy bowels; and people shall overcome people, and the greater shall serve the less.\"[fn-20-P2035_695315:8-nf] Accordingly, since the people or nation of the Jews is anterior in time, and \"greater\" through the grace of primary favour in the Law, whereas ours is understood to be \"less\" in the age of times, as having in the last era of the world[fn-20-P2036_695624:9-nf] attained the knowledge of divine mercy: beyond doubt, through the edict of the divine utterance, the prior and \"greater\" people-that is, the Jewish-must necessarily serve the \"less; \"and the \"less\" people-that is, the Christian-overcome the \"greater.\" For, withal, according to the memorial records of the divine Scriptures, the people of the Jews-that is, the more ancient-quite forsook God, and did degrading service to idols, and, abandoning the Divinity, was surrendered to images; while \"the people\" said to Aaron, \"Make us gods to go before us.\"[fn-20-P2037_696189:10-nf] And when the gold out of the necklaces of the women and the rings of the men had been wholly smelted by fire, and there had come forth a calf-like head, to this figment Israel with one consent (abandoning God) gave honour, saying, \"These are the gods who brought us from the land of Egypt.\"[fn-20-P2038_696520:11-nf] For thus, in the later times in which kings were governing them, did they again, in conjunction with Jeroboam, worship golden kine, and groves, and enslave themselves to Baal.[fn-20-P2039_696767:12-nf] Whence is proved that they have ever been depicted, out of the volume of the divine Scriptures, as guilty of the crime of idolatry; whereas our \"less\"-that is, posterior-people, quitting the idols which formerly it used slavishly to serve, has been converted to the same God from whom Israel, as we have above related, had departed.[fn-20-P2040_697239:13-nf] For thus has the \"less\"-that is, posterior-people overcome the\"greater people,\" while it attains the grace of divine favour, from which Israel has been divorced.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The character of these times learn, along with the Thessalonians.

Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord God, Jesus Christ, at His coming? \"[fn-99-P9915_2738953:164-nf] Likewise: \"Before God, even our Father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the whole company of His saints.\"[fn-99-P9916_2739118:165-nf] He teaches them that they must \"not sorrow concerning them that are asleep,\" and at the same time explains to them the times of the resurrection, saying, \"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus shall God bring with Him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of our Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.\"[fn-99-P9917_2739886:166-nf] What archangel's voice, (I wonder), what trump of God is now heard, except it be, forsooth, in the entertainments of the heretics? For, allowing that the word of the gospel may be called \"the trump of God,\" since it was still calling men, yet they must at that time either be dead as to the body, that they may be able to rise again; and then how are they alive? Or else caught up into the clouds; and how then are they here? \"Most miserable,\" no doubt, as the apostle declared them, are they \"who in this life only\" shall be found to have hope:[fn-99-P9918_2740459:167-nf] they will have to be excluded while they are with premature haste seizing that which is promised after this life; erring concerning the truth, no less than Phygellus and Hermogenes.[fn-99-P9919_2740663:168-nf] Hence it is that the Holy Ghost, in His greatness, foreseeing clearly all such interpretations as these, suggests (to the apostle), in this very epistle of his to the Thessalonians, as follows: \"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, there is no necessity for my writing unto you. For ye yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, `Peace, 'and `All things are safe, 'then sudden destruction shall come upon them.\"[fn-99-P9920_2741170:169-nf] Again, in the second epistle he addresses them with even greater earnestness: \"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto Him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled, either by spirit, or by word,\" that is, the word of false prophets, \"or by letter,\" that is, the letter of false apostles, \"as if from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come, unless indeed there first come a falling away,\" he means indeed of this present empire, \"and that man of sin be revealed,\" that is to say, Antichrist, \"the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or religion; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, affirming that he is God. Remember ye not, that when I was with you, I used to tell you these things? And now ye know what detaineth, that he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now hinders must hinder, until he be taken out of the way.\"[fn-99-P9921_2742263:170-nf] What obstacle is there but the Roman state, the falling away of which, by being scattered into ten kingdoms, shall introduce Antichrist upon (its own ruins)? \"And then shall be revealed the wicked one, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: even him whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.\"[fn-99-P9922_2742769:171-nf] ","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"}]
