But in the making of man himself He concluded and completed the nature of those two materials which we have spoken of as contrary to each other, fire and water. For having made the body, He breathed into it a soul from the vital source of His own Spirit, which is everlasting, that it might bear the similitude of the world itself, which is composed of opposing elements. For he[fn-7-P706_286454:177-nf] consists of soul and body, that is, as it were, of heaven and earth: since the soul by which we live, has its origin, as it were, out of heaven from God, the body out of the earth, of the dust of which we have said that it was formed. Empedocles-whom you cannot tell whether to reckon among poets or philosophers, for he wrote in verse respecting the nature of things, as did Lucretius and Varro among the Romans-determined that there were four elements, that is, fire, air, water, and earth; perhaps following Trismegistus, who said that our bodies were composed of these four elements by God, for he said that they contained in themselves something of fire, something of air, something of water, and something of earth, and yet that they were neither fire, nor air, nor water, nor earth. And these things indeed are not false; for the nature of earth is contained in the flesh, that of moisture in the blood, that of air in the breath, that of fire in the vital heat. But neither can the blood be separated from the body, as moisture is from the earth; nor the vital heat from the breath, as fire from the air: so that of all things only two elements are found, the whole nature of which is included in the formation of our body. Man, therefore, was made from different and opposite substances, as the world itself was made from light and darkness, from life and death; and he has admonished us that these two things contend against each other in man: so that if the soul, which has its origin from God, gains the mastery, it is immortal, and lives in perpetual light; if, on the other hand, the body shall overpower the soul, and subject it to its dominion, it is in everlasting darkness and death.[fn-7-P707_288174:178-nf] And the force of this is not that it altogether annihilates[fn-7-P708_288678:179-nf] the souls of the unrighteous, but subjects them to everlasting punishment.[fn-7-P709_288838:180-nf] ","title":"Book II.

We should indeed mourn for the dead, but only for him whom Gehenna receives, whom Tartarus devours, and for whose punishment the eternal fire burns.

Therefore we should congratulate our dear Blaesilla that she has passed from darkness to light,[fn-12-P1221_260807:818-nf] and has in the first flush of her dawning faith received the crown of her completed work. Had she been cut off (as f pray that none may be) while her thoughts were full of worldly desires and passing pleasures, then mourning would indeed have been her due, and no tears shed for her would have been too many. As it is, by the mercy of Christ she, four months ago, renewed her baptism in her vow of widowhood, and for the rest of her days spurned the world, and thought only of the religions life. Have you no fear, then, lest the Saviour may say to you: \"Are you angry, Paula, that your daughter has become my daughter? Are you vexed at my decree, and do you, with rebellious tears, grudge me the possession of Blaesilla? You ought to know what my purpose is both for you and for yours. You deny yourself food, not to fast but to gratify your grief; and such abstinence is displeasing to me. Such fasts are my enemies. I receive no soul which forsakes the body against my will.

I do not adduce these instances because I have anything in me from which you either can or will learn a lesson, but to show you that your zeal and eagerness to learn-even though you cannot rely on help from me-are in themselves worthy of praise. A mind willing to learn deserves commendation even when it has no teacher. What is of importance to me is not what you find but what you seek to find. Wax is soft and easy to mould even where the hands of craftsman and modeller are wanting to work it. It is already potentially all that it can be made. The apostle Paul learned the Law of Moses and the prophets at the feet of Gamaliel and was glad that he had done so, for armed with this spiritual armour, he was able to say boldly \"the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;\" armed with these we war \"casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; and being in a readiness to revenge all disobedience.\"[fn-20-P2014_502088:1412-nf] He writes to Timothy who had been trained in the holy writings from a child exhorting him to study them diligently[fn-20-P2015_502227:1413-nf] and not to neglect the gift which was given him with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.[fn-20-P2016_502367:1414-nf] To Titus he gives commandment that among a bishop's other virtues (which he briefly describes) he should be careful to seek a knowledge of the scriptures: A bishop, he says, must hold fast \"the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.\"[fn-20-P2017_502708:1415-nf] In fact want of education in a clergyman[fn-20-P2018_502769:1416-nf] prevents him from doing good to any one but himself and much as the virtue of his life may build up Christ's church, he does it an injury as great by failing to resist those who are trying to pull it down. The prophet Haggai says-or rather the Lord says it by the mouth of Haggai-\"Ask now the priests concerning the law.\"[fn-20-P2019_503119:1417-nf] For such is the important function of the priesthood to give answers to those who question them concerning the law. And in Deuteronomy we read \"Ask thy father and he will shew thee; thy elders and they will tell thee.\"[fn-20-P2020_503360:1418-nf] Also in the one hundred and nineteenth psalm \"thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.\" David too, in the description of the righteous man whom he compares to the tree of life in paradise, amongst his other excellences speaks of this, \"His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.\"[fn-20-P2021_503730:1419-nf] In the close of his most solemn vision Daniel declares that \"the righteous shall shine as the stars; and the wise, that is the learned, as the firmament.\"[fn-20-P2022_503904:1420-nf] You can see, therefore, how great is the difference between righteous ignorance and instructed righteousness. Those who have the first are compared with the stars, those who have the second with the heavens. Yet, according to the exact sense of the Hebrew, both statements may be understood of the learned, for it is to be read in this way:-\"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\" Why is the apostle Paul called a chosen vessel?[fn-20-P2023_504456:1421-nf] Assuredly because he is a repertory of the Law and of the holy scriptures. The learned teaching of our Lord strikes the Pharisees dumb with amazement, and they are filled with astonishment to find that Peter and John know the Law although they have not learned letters.

But we have this consolation that it is slain by the word of the Lord. For it is said: \"O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction,\" and in the next verse: \"An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.\"[fn-31-P3136_820533:2270-nf] For, as Isaiah says, \"there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots\":[fn-31-P3137_820692:2271-nf] and He says Himself in the Song of Songs, \"I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley.\"[fn-31-P3138_820815:2272-nf] Our rose is the destruction of death, and died that death itself might die in His dying.

And no one would, for the sake of that life which is to be so happy after death, hasten to the grace of Christ by the power of his contempt of death itself; but with a view to remove the trouble of death, would rather resort to a more delicate mode of believing in Christ. More grace, therefore, than this has He conferred on those who believe on Him; and a greater gift, undoubtedly, has He vouchsafed to them! What great matter would it have been for a man, on seeing that people did not die when they became believers, himself also to believe that he was not to die? How much greater a thing is it, how much braver, how much more laudable, so to believe, that although one is sure to die, he can still hope to live hereafter for evermore!

But he takes us to the Old Testament, and beginning with Adam goes on to Zacharias and Elizabeth. He next confronts us with Peter and the rest of the Apostles.

And as regards Adam and Eve we must maintain that before the fall they were virgins in Paradise: but after they sinned, and were cast out of Paradise, they were immediately married.

And at the same time we must bear in mind the meaning of the phrase, \"replenish the earth.\" Marriage replenishes the earth, virginity fills Paradise. This too we must observe, at least if we would faithfully follow the Hebrew, that while Scripture on the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days relates that, having finished the works of each, \"God saw that it was good,\" on the second day it omitted this altogether, leaving us to understand that two is not a good number because it destroys unity, and prefigures the marriage compact. Hence it was that all the animals which Noah took into the ark by pairs were unclean. Odd numbers denote cleanness. And yet by the double number is represented another mystery: that not even in beasts and unclean birds is second marriage approved.

For you say that the souls of Apostles and martyrs have their abode either in the bosom of Abraham, or in the place of refreshment,or under the altar of God, and that they cannot leave their own tombs, and be present there they will. They are, it seems, of senatorial rank. and are not subjected to the worst kind of prison and the society of murderers, but are kept apart in liberal and honourable custody in the isles of the blessed and the Elysian fields. Will you lay down the law for God? Will you put the Apostles into chains? So that to the day of judgment they re to be kept in confinement, and are not with their Lord, although it is written concerning them,[fn-69-P6951_2233888:13-nf] \"They follow the Lamb, whithersoever he goeth.\" If the Lamb is present everywhere, the same must be believed respecting those who are with the Lamb. And while the devil and the demons wander through the whole world, and with only too great speed present themselves everywhere; are martyrs, after the shedding of their blood, to be kept out of sight shut up in a[fn-69-P6952_2234269:14-nf] coffin, from whence they cannot escape? You say, in your pamphlet, that so long as we are alive we can pray for one another; but once we die, the prayer of no person for another can be heard, and all the more because the martyrs, though they[fn-69-P6953_2234560:15-nf] cry for the avenging of their blood, have never been able to obtain their request. If Apostles and martyrs while still in the body can pray for others, when they ought still to be anxious for themselves, how much more must they do so when once they have won their crowns, overcome, and triumphed? A single man, Moses, oft[fn-69-P6954_2234901:16-nf] wins pardon from God for six hundred thousand armed men; and[fn-69-P6955_2234986:17-nf] Stephen, the follower of his Lord and the first Christian martyr, entreats pardon for his persecutors; and when once they have entered on their life with Christ, shall they have less power than before? The Apostle Paul[fn-69-P6956_2235238:18-nf] says that two hundred and seventy-six souls were given to him in the ship; and when, after his dissolution, he has begun to be with Christ, must he shut his mouth, and be unable to say a word for those who throughout the whole world have believed in his Gospel? Shall Vigilantius the live dog be better than Paul the dead lion? I should be right in saying so after[fn-69-P6957_2235624:19-nf] Ecclesiastes, if I admitted that Paul is dead in spirit. The truth is that the saints are not called dead, but are said to be asleep. Wherefore[fn-69-P6958_2235780:20-nf] Lazarus, who was about to rise again, is said to have slept. And the Apostle[fn-69-P6959_2235875:21-nf] forbids the Thessalonians to be sorry for those who were asleep. As for you, when wide awake you are asleep, and asleep when you write, and you bring before me an apocryphal book which, under the name of Esdras, is read by you and those of your feather, and in this book it is[fn-69-P6960_2236174:22-nf] written that after death no one dares pray for others. I have never read the book: for what need is there to take up what the Church does not receive? It can hardly be your intention to confront me with Balsamus, and Barbelus, and the Thesaurus of Manichaeus, and the ludicrous name of Leusiboras; though possibly because you live at the foot of the Pyrenees, and border on Iberia, you follow the incredible marvels of the ancient heretic[fn-69-P6961_2236767:23-nf] Basilides and his so-called knowledge, which is mere ignorance, and set forth what is condemned by the authority of the whole world. I say this because in your short treatise you quote Solomon as if he were on your side, though Solomon never wrote the words in question at all; so that, as you have a second Esdras you may have a second Solomon. And, if you like, you may read the imaginary revelations of all the patriarchs and prophets, and, when you have learned them, you may sing them among the women in their weaving-shops, or rattler order them to be read in your taverns, the more easily by these melancholy ditties to stimulate the ignorant mob to replenish their cups.","title":"Against Vigilantius","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_108_revelation_of_saint_john_the_theologian_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"ANF-08","text":"And again I said: Lord, and after that what wilt Thou do?

He shall call the heaven above, and the earth, to judge His people. Gather His saints together to Him; they who make a covenant with Him over sacrifices.\"[fn-40-P4003_2196813:136-nf] This we understand of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we look for from heaven to judge the quick and the dead. For He shall come manifestly to judge justly the just and the unjust, who before came hiddenly to be unjustly judged by the unjust. He, I say, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence, that is, shall make Himself known by His voice of judgment, who before, when he came hiddenly, was silent before His judge when He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and, as a lamb before the shearer, opened not His mouth as we read that it was prophesied of Him by Isaiah,[fn-40-P4004_2197409:137-nf] and as we see it fulfilled in the Gospel.[fn-40-P4005_2197472:138-nf] As for the fire and tempest, we have already said how these are to be interpreted when we were explaining a similar passage in Isaiah.[fn-40-P4006_2197630:139-nf] As to the expression, \"He shall call the heaven above,\" as the saints and the righteous are rightly called heaven, no doubt this means what the apostle says, \"We shallbe caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.\"[fn-40-P4007_2197889:140-nf] For if we take the bare literal sense, how is it possible to call the heaven above, as if the heaven could be anywhere else than above? And the following expression, \"And the earth to judge His people,\" if we supply only the words, \"He shall call,\" that is to say, \"He shall call the earth also,\" and do not supply \"above,\" seems to give us a meaning in accordance with sonnet doctrine, the heaven symbolizing those who will judge along with Christ, and the earth those who shall be judged; and thus the words, \"He shall call the heaven above,\" would not mean, \"He shall catch up into the air,\" but \"He shall lift up to seats of judgment.\" Possibly, too, \"He shall call the heaven,\" may mean, He shall call the angels in the high and lofty places, that He may descend with them to do judgment; and \"He shall call the earth also\" would then mean, He shall call the men on the earth to judgment. But if with the words \"and the earth\" we understand not only \"He shall call,\" but also \"above,\" so as to make the full sense be, He shall call the heaven above, and He shall call the earth above, then I think it is best understood of the men who shall be caught up to meet Christ in the air, and that they are called the heaven with reference to their souls, and the earth with reference to their bodies. Then what is \"to judge His people,\" but to separate by judgment the good from the bad, as the sheep from the goats? Then he turns to address the angels: \"Gather His saints together unto Him.\" For certainly a matter so important must be accomplished by the ministry of angels. And if we ask who the saints are who are gathered unto Him by the angels, we are told, \"They who make a covenant with Him over sacrifices.\" This is the whole life of the saints, to make a covenant with God over sacrifices. For \"over sacrifices\" either refers to works of mercy, which are preferable to sacrifices in the judgment of God, who says, \"I desire mercy more than sacrifices,\"[fn-40-P4008_2199874:141-nf] or if \"over sacrifices\" means in sacrifices, then these very works of mercy are the sacrifices with which God is pleased, as I remember to have stated in the tenth book of this work;[fn-40-P4009_2200076:142-nf] and in these works the saints make a covenant with God, because they do them for the sake of the promises which are contained in His new testament or covenant. And hence, when His saints have been gathered to Him and set at His right hand in the last judgment, Christ shall say, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat,\"[fn-40-P4010_2200525:143-nf] and so on, mentioning the good works of the good, and their eternal rewards assigned by the last sentence of the Judge.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"18.

I shall have something to say about Abraham's bosom in the proper place.[fn-51-P5185_1627111:347-nf] As for the restoration of Judµa, however, which even the Jews themselves, induced by the names of places and countries, hope for just as it is described,[fn-51-P5186_1627305:348-nf] it would be tedious to state at length[fn-51-P5187_1627399:349-nf] how the figurative[fn-51-P5188_1627435:350-nf] interpretation is spiritually applicable to Christ and His church, and to the character and fruits thereof; besides, the subject has been regularly treated[fn-51-P5189_1627610:351-nf] in another work, which we entitle De Spe Fidelium.[fn-51-P5190_1627678:352-nf] At present, too, it would be superfluous[fn-51-P5191_1628057:353-nf] for this reason, that our inquiry relates to what is promised in heaven, not on earth. But we do confess that a kingdom is promised to us upon the earth, although before heaven, only in another state of existence; inasmuch as it will be after the resurrection for a thousand years in the divinely-built city of Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5192_1628394:354-nf] \"let down from heaven,\"[fn-51-P5193_1628465:355-nf] which the apostle also calls \"our mother from above; \"[fn-51-P5194_1628540:356-nf] and, while declaring that our poli/teuma, or citizenship, is in heaven,[fn-51-P5195_1628632:357-nf] he predicates of it[fn-51-P5196_1628699:358-nf] that it is really a city in heaven. This both Ezekiel had knowledge of[fn-51-P5197_1628786:359-nf] and the Apostle John beheld.[fn-51-P5198_1628843:360-nf] And the word of the new prophecy which is a part of our belief,[fn-51-P5199_1628931:361-nf] attests how it foretold that there would be for a sign a picture of this very city exhibited. to view previous to its manifestation. This prophecy, indeed, has been very lately fulfilled in an expedition to the East.[fn-52-P5200_1629283:362-nf] For it is evident from the testimony of even heathen witnesses, that in Judµa there was suspended in the sky a city early every morning for forty days. As the day advanced, the entire figure of its walls would wane gradually,[fn-52-P5201_1629622:363-nf] and sometimes it would vanish instantly.[fn-52-P5202_1629683:364-nf] We say that this city has been provided by God for receiving the saints on their resurrection, and refreshing them with the abundance of all really spiritual blessings, as a recompense for those which in the world we have either despised or lost; since it is both just and God-worthy that His servants should have their joy in the place where they have also suffered affliction for His name's sake. Of the heavenly kingdom this is the process.[fn-52-P5203_1630210:365-nf] After its thousand years are over, within which period is completed the resurrection of the saints, who rise sooner or later according to their deserts there will ensue the destruction of the world and the conflagration of all things at the judgment: we shall then be changed in a moment into the substance of angels, even by the investiture of an incorruptible nature, and so be removed to that kingdom in heaven of which we have now been treating, just as if it had not been predicted by the Creator, and as if it were proving Christ to belong to the other god and as if he were the first and sole revealer of it. But now learn that it has been, in fact, predicted by the Creator, and that even without prediction it has a claim upon our faith in respect of[fn-52-P5204_1630984:366-nf] the Creator. What appears to be probable to you, when Abraham's seed, after the primal promise of being like the sand of the sea for multitude, is destined likewise. to an equality with the stars of heaven-are not these the indications both of an earthly and a heavenly dispensation?[fn-52-P5205_1631313:367-nf] When Isaac, in blessing his son Jacob, says, \"God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,\"[fn-52-P5206_1631448:368-nf] are there not in his words examples of both kinds of blessing? Indeed, the very form of the blessing is in this instance worthy of notice. For in relation to Jacob, who is the type of the later and more excellent people, that is to say ourselves,[fn-52-P5207_1631718:369-nf] first comes the promise of the heavenly dew, and afterwards that about the fatness of the earth. So are we first invited to heavenly blessings when we are separated from the world, and afterwards we thus find ourselves in the way of obtaining also earthly blessings. And your own gospel likewise has it in this wise: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and these things shall be added unto you.\"[fn-52-P5208_1632177:370-nf] But to Esau the blessing promised is an earthly one, which he supplements with a heavenly, after the fatness of the earth, saying, \"Thy dwelling shall be also of the dew of heaven.\"[fn-52-P5209_1632380:371-nf] For the dispensation of the Jews (who were in Esau, the prior of the sons in birth, but the later in affection[fn-52-P5210_1632514:372-nf] ) at first was imbued with earthly blessings through the law, and afterwards brought round to heavenly ones through the gospel by faith. When Jacob sees in his dream the steps of a ladder set upon the earth, and reaching to heaven, with angels ascending and descending thereon, and the Lord standing above, we shall without hesitation venture to suppose,[fn-52-P5211_1633233:373-nf] that by this ladder the Lord has in judgment appointed that the way to heaven is shown to men, whereby some may attain to it, and others fall therefrom. For why, as soon as he awoke out of his sleep, and shook through a dread of the spot, does he fall to an interpretation of his dream? He exclaims, \"How terrible is this place!\" And then adds, \"This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!\"[fn-52-P5212_1633692:374-nf] For he had seen Christ the Lord, the temple of God, and also the gate by whom heaven is entered. Now surely he would not have mentioned the gate of heaven, if heaven is not entered in the dispensation of the[fn-52-P5213_1633927:375-nf] Creator. But there is now a gate provided by Christ, which admits and conducts to glory. Of this Amos says: \"He buildeth His ascensions into heaven; \"[fn-52-P5214_1634091:376-nf] certainly not for Himself alone, but for His people also, who will be with Him. \"And Thou shall bind them about Thee,\" says he, \"like the adornment of a bride.\"[fn-52-P5215_1634272:377-nf] Accordingly the Spirit, admiring such as soar up to the celestial realms by these ascensions, says, \"They fly, as if they were kites; they fly as clouds, and as young doves, unto me\"[fn-52-P5216_1634477:378-nf] -that is, simply like a dove.[fn-52-P5217_1634526:379-nf] For we shall, according to the apostle, be caught up into the clouds to meet the Lord (even the Son of man, who shall come in the clouds, according to Daniel[fn-52-P5218_1634763:380-nf] ) and so shall we ever be with the Lord,[fn-52-P5219_1634824:381-nf] so long as He remains both on the earth and in heaven, who, against such as are thankless for both one promise and the other, calls the elements themselves to witness: \"Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth.\"[fn-52-P5220_1635058:382-nf] Now, for my own part indeed, even though Scripture held out no hand of heavenly hope to me (as, in fact, it so often does), I should still possess a sufficient presumption[fn-52-P5221_1635248:383-nf] of even this promise, in my present enjoyment of the earthly gift; and I should look out for something also of the heavenly, from Him who is the God of heaven as well as of earth. I should thus believe that the Christ who promises the higher blessings is (the Son) of Him who had also promised the lower ones; who had, moreover, afforded proofs of greater gifts by smaller ones; who had reserved for His Christ alone this revelation[fn-52-P5222_1635702:384-nf] of a (perhaps[fn-52-P5223_1635735:385-nf] ) unheard of kingdom, so that, while the earthly glory was announced by His servants, the heavenly might have God Himself for its messenger. You, however, argue for another Christ, from the very circumstance that He proclaims a new kingdom. You ought first to bring forward some example of His beneficence,[fn-52-P5224_1636059:386-nf] that I may have no good reason for doubting the credibility of the great promise, which you say ought to be hoped for; nay, it is before all things necessary that you should prove that a heaven belongs to Him, whom you declare to be a promiser of heavenly things.

And this counsel is not to be understood as if the apostle prohibited conjugal-that is to say, lawful and honourable -cohabitation; but so as that that cohabitation (which would have no adjunct of unwholesome lust, were it not that man's perfect freedom of choice had become by preceding sin so disabled that it has this fatal adjunct) should not be a matter of will, but of necessity, without which, nevertheless, it would be impossible to attain to the fruition of the will itself in the procreation of children. And this wish is not in the marriages of believers determined by the purpose of having such children born as shall pass through life in this present world, but such as shall be born again in Christ, and remain in Him for evermore. Now if this result should come about, the reward of a full felicity will spring from marriage; but if such result be not realized, there will yet ensue to the married pair the peace of their good will. Whosoever possesses his vessel (that is, his wife) with this intention of heart, certainly does not possess her in the \"disease of desire,\" as the Gentiles which know not God, but in sanctification and honour, as believers who hope in God. A man turns to use the evil of concupiscence, and is not overcome by it, when he bridles and restrains its rage, as it works in inordinate and indecorous motions; and never relaxes his hold upon it except when intent on offspring, and then controls and applies it to the carnal generation of children to be spiritually regenerated, not to the subjection of the spirit to the flesh in a sordid servitude. That the holy fathers of olden times after Abraham, and before him, to whom God gave His testimony that \"they pleased Him,\"[fn-38-P3877_1471016:27-nf] thus used their wives, no one who is a Christian ought to doubt, since it was permitted to certain individuals amongst them to have a plurality of wives, where the reason was for the multiplication of their offspring, not the desire of varying gratification.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_23_book_xii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"And the mode in which they logically maintain their profanity is as follows;-that either by the relative term employed there is expressed community of essence also between the disciples and the Father, or else we must not by this phrase bring even the Lord into communion in the Father's Nature, and that, even as the fact[fn-20-P2093_1267629:7-nf] that the God over all is named as their God implies that the disciples are His servants so by parity of reasoning, it is acknowledged, by the words in question, that the Son also is the servant of God. Now that the words addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and Father, of Whom are all things[fn-20-P2094_1268713:8-nf] .\" Accordingly human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of foresight[fn-20-P2095_1269055:9-nf] , imports a certain relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father's image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, \"by nature were no Gods[fn-20-P2096_1269960:10-nf] ,\" and in the place of the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, \"The partridge called, she gathered together what she hatched not[fn-20-P2097_1270174:11-nf] .\" Since, then, this was the sum of our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature[fn-20-P2098_1270575:12-nf] . For human nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us[fn-20-P2099_1271124:13-nf] , and frees us from the curse by taking on Him our curse as His own[fn-21-P2100_1271215:14-nf] , and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle, \"slain\" in Himself \"the enmity[fn-21-P2101_1271328:15-nf] \" which by means of sin had come between us and God,-(in fact sin was \"the enmity\")-and having become what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God[fn-21-P2102_1271640:16-nf] , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-21-P2103_1271716:17-nf] , He drew with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day become disciples of the Word,-the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is hallowed[fn-21-P2104_1272237:18-nf] . \"For behold,\" He says, \"I and the children whom God hath given Me[fn-21-P2105_1272327:19-nf] .\" He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin[fn-21-P2106_1272542:20-nf] . And so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ's Humanity is a common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also \"shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air[fn-21-P2107_1273219:21-nf] ,\" even so, when we hear that the true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt hat we shall come to the same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner[fn-21-P2108_1273533:22-nf] . And the fact too that this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we have given For since, as the Apostle tells us, \"the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression[fn-21-P2109_1273771:23-nf] ,\" and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering[fn-21-P2110_1274235:24-nf] to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He goes on to say: \"After a while the divine Scripture says again, `Adam knew Eve his wife; and she bare a son, and he called his name Seth: saying, The Lord hath raised me up another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.'\" He then adds: \"The Divinity is said to have raised up the seed itself; as a proof that the sexual union was His appointment.\" This person did not understand what the Scripture records; for he supposed that the reason why it is said, The Lord hath raised me up another seed instead of Abel, was none other than that God might be supposed to have excited in him a desire for sexual intercourse, by means whereof seed might be raised for being poured into the woman's womb.

Nor is it now necessary that we enquire, and put forth a definite opinion on that question, whence could exist the progeny of the first men, whom God had blessed, saying, \"Increase, and be ye multiplied, and fill the earth;\"[fn-37-P3744_1764685:2-nf] if they had not sinned, whereas their bodies by sinning deserved the condition of death, and there can be no sexual intercourse save of mortal bodies.

Thus, therefore, even through sexual intercourse there might take place generations of such bodies, as up to a certain point should have increase, and yet should not pass into old age; or even into old age, and yet not into death; until the earth were filled with that multiplication of the blessing. For if to the garments of the Israelites[fn-37-P3748_1767293:6-nf] God granted their proper state without any wearing away during forty years, how much more would He grant unto the bodies of such as obeyed His command a certain most happy temperament of sure state, until they should be changed for the better, not by death of the man, whereby the body is abandoned by the soul, but by a blessed change from mortality to immortality, from an animal to a spiritual quality.

But when through desire reigning they shall have been joined together, if they shall after overcome it, because it is not lawful to loose, in such wise as it was lawful not to tie, the marriage bond, they become such as the form of marriage makes profession of, so as that either by mutual consent they ascend unto a higher degree of holiness, or, if both are not such, the due who is such will not be one to exact but to yield the due, observing in all things a chaste and religious concord. But in those times, wherein as yet the mystery of our salvation was veiled in prophetic sacraments, even they who were such before marriage, yet contracted marriage through the duty of begetting children, not overcome by lust, but led by piety, unto whom if there were given such choice as in the revelation of the New Testament there hath been given, the Lord saying \"Whoso can receive, let him receive;\"[fn-38-P3800_1798759:45-nf] no one doubts that they would have been ready to receive it even with joy, who reads with careful attention what use they made of their wives, at a time when also it was allowed one man to have several, whom he had with more chastity, than any now has his one wife, of these, unto whom we see what the Apostle allows by way of leave.[fn-38-P3801_1799113:46-nf] For they had them in the work of begetting children, not \"in the disease of desire, as the nations which know not God.\"[fn-38-P3802_1799253:47-nf] And this is so great a thing, that many at this day more easily abstain from all sexual intercourse their whole life through, than, if they are joined in marriage, observe the measure of not coming together except for the sake of children.

What injury did Israel commit against him in slaying those whom he too has reprobated, since he was the first to pass a hostile sentence on them? But Israel sinned against their own God. He upbraided their iniquity to whom the injured God pertains; and certainly he is anything but the adversary of the injured Deity. Else he would not have burdened them with the charge of killing even the Lord, in the words, \"Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets,\" although (the pronoun) their own be an addition of the heretics.[fn-78-P7892_2248189:703-nf] Now, what was there so very acrimonious[fn-78-P7893_2248429:704-nf] in their killing Christ the proclaimer of the new god, after they had put to death also the prophets of their own god?

What that \"sanctification of ours\" is, which he declares to be \"the will of God,\" you may discover from the opposite conduct which he forbids. That we should \"abstain from fornication,\" not from marriage; that every one \"should know how to possess his vessel in honour.\"[fn-78-P7897_2249502:708-nf] In what way? \"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles.\"[fn-78-P7898_2249599:709-nf] Concupiscence, however, is not ascribed to marriage even among the Gentiles, but to extravagant, unnatural, and enormous sins.[fn-78-P7899_2249749:710-nf] The law of nature[fn-79-P7900_2249788:711-nf] is opposed to luxury as well as to grossness and uncleanness;[fn-79-P7901_2249883:712-nf] it does not forbid connubial intercourse, but concupiscence; and it takes care of[fn-79-P7902_2250082:713-nf] our vessel by the honourable estate of matrimony.

For he has already quenched and despised the thing which he destroys, and is unable to forbid what he has despised.[fn-79-P7910_2251790:721-nf] It is then incumbent on Marcion now to display in his church that spirit of his god which must not be quenched, and the prophesyings which must not be despised.

And when he shall have failed to produce and give proof of any such criterion, we will then on our side bring out both the Spirit and the prophecies of the Creator, which utter predictions according to His will. Thus it will be clearly seen of what the apostle spoke, even of those things which were to happen in the church of his God; and as long as He endures, so long also does His Spirit work, and so long are His promises repeated.[fn-79-P7912_2252793:723-nf] Come now, you who deny the salvation of the flesh, and who, whenever there occurs the specific mention of body in a case of this sort,[fn-79-P7913_2252947:724-nf] interpret it as meaning anything rather than the substance of the flesh, (tell me) how is it that the apostle has given certain distinct names to all (our faculties), and has comprised them all in one prayer for their safety, desiring that our \"spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord and Saviour (Jesus) Christ? \"[fn-79-P7914_2253356:725-nf] Now he has here pro-pounded the soul and the body as two several and distinct things.[fn-79-P7915_2253588:726-nf] For although the soul has a kind of body of a quality of its own,[fn-79-P7916_2255056:727-nf] just as the spirit has, yet as the soul and the body are distinctly named, the soul has its own peculiar appellation, not requiring the common designation of body.

Indeed, I see no other substance in man, after spirit and soul, to which the term body can be applied except \"the flesh.\" This, therefore, I understand to be meant by the word \"body \"-as often as the latter is not specifically named.

But while he exposes these tempers as the sole cause of the diversity, he avoids inculpating the regular mysteries of the faith,[fn-81-P8110_2304408:906-nf] and affirms that there is, notwithstanding, but one Christ and His one God, whatever motives men had in preaching Him. Therefore, says he, it matters not to me \"whether it be in pretence or in truth that Christ is preached,\"[fn-81-P8111_2304663:907-nf] because one Christ alone was announced, whether in their \"pretentious\" or their \"truthful\" faith. For it was to the faithfulness of their preaching that he applied the word truth, not to the rightness of the rule itself, because there was indeed but one rule; whereas the conduct of the preachers varied: in some of them it was true, i. e. single-minded, while in others it was sophisticated with over-much learning. This being the case, it is manifest that that Christ was the subject of their preaching who was always the theme of the prophets. Now, if it were a completely different Christ that was being introduced by the apostle, the novelty of the thing would have produced a diversity (in belief.). For there would not have been wanting, in spite of the novel teaching,[fn-81-P8112_2305460:908-nf] men to interpret the preached gospel of the Creator's Christ, since the majority of persons everywhere now-a-days are of our way of thinking, rather than on the heretical side. So that the apostle would not in such a passage as the present one have refrained from remarking and censuring the diversity. Since, however, there is no blame of a diversity, there is no proof of a novelty. Of course[fn-81-P8113_2305875:909-nf] the Marcionites suppose that they have the apostle on their side in the following passage in the matter of Christ's substance-that in Him there was nothing but a phantom of flesh. For he says of Christ, that, \"being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God;[fn-81-P8114_2306173:910-nf] but emptied[fn-81-P8115_2306249:911-nf] Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant,\" not the reality, \"and was made in the likeness of man,\" not a man, \"and was found in fashion as a man,\"[fn-81-P8116_2306431:912-nf] not in his substance, that is to say, his flesh; just as if to a substance there did not accrue both form and likeness and fashion. It is well for us that in another passage (the apostle) calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-81-P8117_2306690:913-nf] For will it not follow with equal force from that passage, that Christ is not truly God, because the apostle places Him in the image of God, if, (as Marcion contends, ) He is not truly man because of His having taken on Him the form or image of a man? For in both cases the true substance will have to be excluded, if image (or \"fashion\") and likeness and form shall be claimed for a phantom. But since he is truly God, as the Son of the Father, in His fashion and image, He has been already by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, \"found in the fashion \"and image\" of a man.\" For when he propounded[fn-81-P8118_2307348:914-nf] Him as thus \"found\" in the manner[fn-81-P8119_2307397:915-nf] of a man, he in fact affirmed Him to be most certainly human. For what is found, manifestly possesses existence. Therefore, as He was found to be God by His mighty power, so was He found to be man by reason of His flesh, because the apostle could not have pronounced Him to have \"become obedient unto death,\"[fn-81-P8120_2307731:916-nf] if He had not been constituted of a mortal substance. Still more plainly does this appear from the apostle's additional words, \"even the death of the cross.\"[fn-81-P8121_2307909:917-nf] For he could hardly mean this to be a climax[fn-81-P8122_2307974:918-nf] to the human suffering, to extol the virtue[fn-81-P8123_2308047:919-nf] of His obedience, if he had known it all to be the imaginary process of a phantom, which rather eluded the cross than experienced it, and which displayed no virtue[fn-81-P8124_2308247:920-nf] in the suffering, but only illusion. But \"those things which he had once accounted gain,\" and which he enumerates in the preceding verse-\"trust in the flesh,\" the sign of \"circumcision,\" his origin as \"an Hebrew of the Hebrews,\" his descent from \"the tribe of Benjamin,\" his dignity in the honours of the Pharisee[fn-81-P8125_2308592:921-nf] -he now reckons to be only \"loss\" to himself;[fn-81-P8126_2308686:922-nf] (in other words, ) it was not the God of the Jews, but their stupid obduracy, which he repudiates. These are also the things \"which he counts but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ\"[fn-81-P8127_2308905:923-nf] (but by no means for the rejection of God the Creator); \"whilst he has not his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" i.e. Christ, \"the righteousness which is of God.\"[fn-81-P8128_2309127:924-nf] Then, say you, according to this distinction the law did not proceed from the God of Christ. Subtle enough! But here is something still more subtle for you. For when (the apostle) says, \"Not (the righteousness) which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" he would not have used the phrase through Him of any other than Him to whom the law belonged. \"Our conversation,\" says he, \"is in heaven.\"[fn-81-P8129_2309551:925-nf] I here recognise the Creator's ancient promise to Abraham: \"I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven.\"[fn-81-P8130_2309683:926-nf] Therefore \"one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-81-P8131_2309764:927-nf] If, again, Christ in His advent from heaven \"shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body,\"[fn-81-P8132_2309928:928-nf] it follows that this body of ours shall rise again, which is now in a state of humiliation in its sufferings and according to the law of mortality drops into the ground. But how shall it be changed, if it shall have no real existence? If, however, this is only said of those who shall be found in the flesh[fn-81-P8133_2310368:929-nf] at the advent of God, and who shall have to be changed,\"[fn-81-P8134_2310451:930-nf] what shall they do who will rise first? They will have no substance from which to undergo a change. But he says (elsewhere), \"We shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord (in the air).\"[fn-81-P8135_2310824:931-nf] Then, if we are to be caught up alone with them, surely we shall likewise be changed together with them.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"419","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Genesis: \"Then said the Lord to Adam, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of that tree of which alone I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat, cursed shall be the ground in all thy works; in sadness and groaning shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life: thorns and thistles shall it cast forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy brow.

Thus the soul of the young man or the old man who lost his hand in his infancy advances with two hands, indeed (because the one which shrank back escaped the amputation of the bodily limb), but one of these was the hand of an adult, young or old, according to the hypothesis, while the other was only an infant's hand, just as it was when the amputation happened.

Had it been so, things would have fallen out as I desire, for it is my wish that the life of all those who are purposed to live in true religion should be happily spent. But the Lord, Who ordains our course in accordance with His ineffable wisdom, has arranged that all these things should come about for the advantage of our souls, whereby He has, on the one hand, made your life sorrowful, and on the other, roused the sympathy of one who, like myself, is united to you in godly love.

But my bad health and the present business which occupies me have caused this very journey, which I have undertaken, to be injurious to the interests of my Church. I have, therefore, determined to address your excellency in writing, to remind you that these afflictions are not sent by the Lord, Who rules us, to the servants of God to no purpose, but as a test of the genuineness of our love to the divine Creator. Just as athletes win crowns by their struggles in the arena, so are Christians brought to perfection by the trial of their temptations, if only we learn to accept what is sent us by the Lord with becoming patience, with all thanksgiving. All things are ordained by the Lord's love. We must not accept anything that befalls us as grievous, even if, for the present, it affects our weakness. We are ignorant, peradventure, of the reasons why each tiring that happens to us is sent to us as a blessing by the Lord but we ought to be convinced that all that happens to us is for our good, either for the reward of our patience, or for the soul which we have received, lest, by lingering too long in this life, it be filled with the wickedness to be found in this world. If the hope of Christians is limited to this life, it might rightly have been reckoned a bitter lot to be prematurely parted from the body; but if, to them that love God, the sundering of the soul from these bodily fetters is the beginning of our real life, why do we grieve like them which have no hope?[fn-38-P3865_1255713:3-nf] Be comforted then, and do not fall under your troubles, but show that you are superior to them and can rise above them.","title":"Letter CI","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When, however, we attribute to the soul authority, and to the flesh submission, we must see to it that (our opponents) do not turn our position by another argument, by insisting on so placing the flesh in the service of the soul, that it be not (considered as) its servant, lest they should be compelled, if it were so regarded, to admit its companionship (to the soul). For they would argue that servants and companions possess a discretion in discharging the functions of their respective office, and a power over their will in both relations: in short, (they would claim to be) men themselves, and therefore (would expect) to share the credit with their principals, to whom they voluntarily yielded their assistance; whereas the flesh had no discretion, no sentiment in itself, but possessing no power of its own of willing or refusing, it, in fact, appears to stand to the soul in the stead of a vessel as an instrument rather than a servant. The soul alone, therefore, will have to be judged (at the last day) pre-eminently as to how it has employed the vessel of the flesh; the vessel itself, of course, not being amenable to a judicial award: for who condemns the cup if any. man has mixed poison in it? or who sentences the sword to the beasts, if a man has perpetrated with it the atrocities of a brigand? Well, now, we will grant that the flesh is innocent, in so far as bad actions will not be charged upon it: what, then, is there to hinder its being saved on the score of its innocence? For although it is free from all imputation of good works, as it is of evil ones, yet it is more consistent with the divine goodness to deliver the innocent. A beneficent man, indeed, is bound to do so: it suits then the character of the Most Bountiful to bestow even gratuitously such a favour. And yet, as to the cup, I will not take the poisoned one, into which some certain death is injected, but one which has been infected with the breath of a lascivious woman,[fn-98-P9818_2706399:91-nf] or of Cybele's priest, or of a gladiator, or of a hangman: then I want to know whether you would pass a milder condemnation on it than on the kisses of such persons? One indeed which is soiled with our own filth, or one which is not mingled to our own mind we are apt to dash to pieces, and then to increase our anger with our servant. As for the sword, which is drunk with the blood of the brigand's victims, who would not banish it entirely from his house, much more from his bed-room, or from his pillow, from the presumption that he would be sure to dream of nothing but the apparitions of the souls which were pursuing and disquieting him for lying down with the blade which shed their own blood? Take, however, the cup which has no reproach on it, and which deserves the credit of a faithful ministration, it will be adorned by its drinking-master with chaplets, or be honoured with a handful of flowers. The sword also which has received honourable stains in war, and has been thus engaged in a better manslaughter, will secure its own praise by consecration. It is quite possible, then, to pass decisive sentences even on vessels and on instruments, that so they too may participate in the merits of their proprietors and employers. Thus much do I say from a desire to meet even this argument, although there is a failure in the example, owing to the diversity in the nature of the objects. For every vessel or every instrument becomes useful from without, consisting as it does of material perfectly extraneous to the substance of the human owner or employer; whereas the flesh, being conceived, formed, and generated along with the soul from its earliest existence in the womb, is mixed up with it likewise in all its operations. For although it is called \"a vessel\" by the apostle, such as he enjoins to be treated \"with honour,\"[fn-98-P9819_2708279:92-nf] it is yet designated by the same apostle as \"the outward man,\"[fn-98-P9820_2708363:93-nf] -that clay, of course, which at the first was inscribed with the title of a man, not of a cup or a sword, or any paltry vessel. Now it is called a \"vessel\" in consideration of its capacity, whereby it receives and contains the soul; but \"man,\" from its community of nature, which renders it in all operations a servant and not an instrument. Accordingly, in the judgment it will be held to be a servant (even though it may have no independent discretion of its own), on the ground of its being an integral portion of that which possesses such discretion, and is not a mere chattel. And although the apostle is well aware that the flesh does nothing of itself which is not also imputed to the soul, he yet deems the flesh to be \"sinful; \"[fn-98-P9821_2709121:94-nf] lest it should be supposed to be free from all responsibility by the mere fact of its seeming to be impelled by the soul. So, again, when he is ascribing certain praiseworthy actions to the flesh, he says, \"Therefore glorify and exalt God in your body,\"[fn-98-P9822_2709394:95-nf] -being certain that such efforts are actuated by the soul; but still he ascribes them to the flesh, because it is to it that he also promises the recompense. Besides, neither rebuke, (on the one hand), would have been suitable to it, if free from blame; nor, (on the other hand), would exhortation, if it were incapable of glory. Indeed, both rebuke and exhortation would be alike idle towards the flesh, if it were an improper object for that recompence which is certainly received in the resurrection.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The character of these times learn, along with the Thessalonians.

Because, however, he had called the flesh a house, he wished elegantly to use the same term in his comparison of the ultimate reward; promising to the very house, which undergoes dissolution through suffering, a better house through the resurrection.

If, they say, it be actually the selfsame substance which is recalled to life with all its form, and lineaments, and quality, then why not with all its other characteristics? Then the blind, and the lame, and the palsied, and whoever else may have passed away with any conspicuous mark, will return again with the same. What now is the fact, although you in the greatness of your conceit[fn-102-P10288_2877757:437-nf] thus disdain to accept from God so vast a grace? Does it not happen that, when you now admit the salvation of only the soul, you ascribe it to men at the cost of half their nature? What is the good of believing in the resurrection, unless your faith embraces the whole of it? If the flesh is to be repaired after its dissolution, much more will it be restored after some violent injury. Greater cases prescribe rules for lesser ones. Is not the amputation or the crushing of a limb the death of that limb? Now, if the death of the whole person is rescinded by its resurrection, what must we say of the death of a part of him? If we are changed for glory, how much more for integrity![fn-102-P10289_2878462:438-nf] Any loss sustained by our bodies is an accident to them, but their entirety is their natural property. In this condition we are born. Even if we become injured in the womb, this is loss suffered by what is already a human being. Natural condition\"[fn-102-P10290_2878755:439-nf] is prior to injury. As life is bestowed by God, so is it restored by Him. As we are when we receive it, so are we when we recover it. To nature, not to injury, are we restored; to our state by birth, not to our condition by accident, do we rise again. If God raises not men entire, He raises not the dead. For what dead man is entire, although he dies entire? Who is without hurt, that is without life? What body is uninjured, when it is dead, when it is cold, when it is ghastly, when it is stiff, when it is a corpse? When is a man more infirm, than when he is entirely infirm? When more palsied, than when quite motionless? Thus, for a dead man to be raised again, amounts to nothing short of his being restored to his entire condition,-lest he, forsooth, be still dead in that part in which he has not risen again. God is quite able to re-make what He once made. This power and this unstinted grace of His He has already sufficiently guaranteed in Christ; and has displayed Himself to us (in Him) not only as the restorer of the flesh, but as the repairer of its breaches. And so the apostle says: \"The dead shall be raised incorruptible\" (or unimpaired).[fn-102-P10291_2879930:440-nf] But how so, unless they become entire, who have wasted away either in the loss of their health, or in the long decrepitude of the grave? For when he propounds the two clauses, that \"this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality, \"[fn-102-P10292_2880220:441-nf] he does not repeat the same statement, but sets forth a distinction. For, by assigning immortality to the repeating of death, and incorruption to the repairing of the wasted body, he has fitted one to the raising and the other to the retrieval of the body. I suppose, moreover, that he promises to the Thessalonians the integrity of the whole substance of man.[fn-102-P10293_2880603:442-nf] So that for the great future there need be no fear of blemished or defective bodies. Integrity, whether the result of preservation or restoration, will be able to lose nothing more, after the time that it has given back to it whatever it had lost. Now, when you contend that the flesh will still have to undergo the same sufferings, if the same flesh be said to have to rise again, you rashly set up nature against her Lord, and impiously contrast her law against His grace; as if it were not permitted the Lord God both to change nature, and to preserve her, without subjection to a law. How is it, then, that we read, \"With men these things are impossible, but with God all things are possible; \"[fn-102-P10294_2881339:443-nf] and again, \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise? \"[fn-102-P10295_2881445:444-nf] Let me ask you, if you were to manumit your slave (seeing that the same flesh and soul will remain to him, which once were exposed to the whip, and the fetter, and the stripes), will it therefore be fit for him to undergo the same old sufferings? I trow not. He is instead thereof honoured with the grace of the white robe, and the favour of the gold ring, and the name and tribe as well as table of his patron. Give, then, the same prerogative to God, by virtue of such a change, of reforming our condition, not our nature, by taking away from it all sufferings, and surrounding it with safeguards of protection. Thus our flesh shall remain even after the resurrection-so far indeed susceptible of suffering, as it is the flesh, and the same flesh too; but at the same time impassible, inasmuch as it has been liberated by the Lord for the very end and purpose of being no longer capable of enduring suffering.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_14_npnf1_14_123_homily_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"[3.] \"Follow peace with all men, and holiness.\" What does he mean by \"holiness\"[fn-72-P7214_2453481:9-nf] ?

And this it seems to me the Divine apostle considered when he declared in his epistle to the Corinthians the sudden stoppage of time, and the change of the things that are now moving on back to the opposite end where he says, \"Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump[fn-33-P3310_2161092:109-nf] .\" For when, as I suppose, the full complement of human nature has reached the limit of the pre-determined measure, because there is no longer anything to be made up in the way of increase to the number of souls, he teaches us that the change in existing things will take place in an instant of time, giving to that limit of time which has no parts or extension the names of \"a moment,\" and \"the twinkling of an eye\"; so that it will no more be possible for one who reaches the verge of time (which is the last and extreme point, from the fact that nothing is lacking to the attainment of its extremity) to obtain by death this change which takes place at a fixed period, but only when the trumpet of the resurrection sounds, which awakens the dead, and transforms those who are left in life, after the likeness of those who have undergone the resurrection change, at once to incorruptibility; so that the weight of the flesh is no longer heavy, nor does its burden hold them down to earth, but they rise aloft through the air-for, \"we shall be caught up,\" he tells us, \"in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord[fn-33-P3311_2162281:110-nf] .\"","title":"On the Making of Man","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_36_on_the_making_of_man","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"240","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"11. His miraculous power proceeds to a still more exalted act, that its display may more closely approach that miracle of the resurrection which men doubt. One of the Lord's companions and friends is ill (Lazarus is the sick man's name); and the Lord deprecates any visiting of His friend, though far away from the sick man, that in the absence of the Life, death might find room and power to do his own work by the agency of disease. The Lord informs His disciples in Galilee of what has befallen Lazarus, and also of his own setting out to him to raise him up when laid low. They, however, were exceedingly afraid on account of the fury of the Jews, thinking it a difficult and dangerous matter to turn again towards Judaea, in the midst of those who sought to slay Him: and thus, lingering and delaying, they return slowly from Galilee: but they do return, for His command prevailed, and the disciples were led by the Lord to be initiated at Bethany in the preliminary mysteries of the general resurrection. Four days had already passed since the event; all due rites had been performed for the departed; the body was hidden in the tomb: it was probably already swollen and beginning to dissolve into corruption, as the body mouldered in the dank earth and necessarily decayed: the thing was one to turn from, as the dissolved body under the constraint of nature changed to offensiveness[fn-33-P3358_2184938:130-nf] . At this point the doubted fact of the general resurrection is brought to proof by a more manifest miracle; for one is not raised from severe sickness, nor brought back to life when at the last breath-nor is a child just dead brought to life, nor a young man about to be conveyed to the tomb released from his bier; but a man past the prime of life, a corpse, decaying, swollen, yea already in a state of dissolution, so that even his own kinsfolk could not suffer that the Lord should draw near the tomb by reason of the offensiveness of the decayed body there enclosed, brought into life by a single call, confirms the proclamation of the resurrection, that is to say, that expectation of it as universal, which we learn by a particular experience to entertain. For as in the regeneration of the universe the Apostle tells us that \"the Lord Himself will descend with a shout, with the voice of the archangel[fn-33-P3359_2186161:131-nf] ,\" and by a trumpet sound raise up the dead to incorruption-so now too he who is in the tomb, at the voice of command, shakes off death as if it were a sleep, and ridding himself from the corruption that had come upon his condition of a corpse, leaps forth from the tomb whole and sound, not even hindered in his egress by the bonds of the grave-cloths round his feet and hands.","title":"On the Making of Man","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_36_book_ii_of_the_canonical_system_of_the_nocturnal_prayers_and_psalms_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And so throughout the whole of Egypt and the Thebaid, where monasteries are not rounded at the fancy of every man who renounces the world, but through a succession of fathers and their traditions last even to the present day, or are rounded so to last, in these we have noticed that a prescribed system of prayers is observed in their evening assemblies and nocturnal vigils. For no one is allowed to preside over the assembly of the brethren, or even over himself, before he has not only deprived himself of all his property but has also learnt the fact that he is not his own maker and has no authority over his own actions. For one who renounces the world, whatever property or riches he may possess, must seek the common dwelling of a Coenobium, that he may not flatter himself in any way with what he has forsaken or what he has brought into the monastery. He must also be obedient to all, so as to learn that he must, as the Lord says,[fn-20-P2010_876392:8-nf] become again a little child, arrogating nothing to himself on the score of his age and the number of the years which he now counts as lost while they were spent to no purpose in the world and, as he is only a beginner, and because of the novelty of the apprenticeship, which he knows he is serving in Christ's service, he should not hesitate to submit himself even to his juniors. Further, he is obliged to habituate himself to work and toil, so as to prepare with his own hands; in accordance with the Apostle's command,[fn-20-P2011_876940:9-nf] daily supply of food, either for his own use or for the wants of strangers; and that he may also forget the pride and luxury of his past life, and gain by grinding toil humility of heart. And so no one is chosen to be set over a congregation of brethren before that he who is to be placed in authority has learnt by obedience what he ought to enjoin on those who are to submit to him, and has discovered from the rules of the Elders what he ought to teach to his juniors. For they. say that to rule or to be ruled well needs a wise man, and they call it the greatest gift and grace of the Holy Spirit, since no one can enjoin salutary precepts on those who submit to him but one who has previously been trained in all the rules of virtue; nor can any one obey an Eider but one who has been filled with the love of God and perfected in the virtue of humility. And so we see that there is a variety of rules and regulations in use throughout other districts, because we often have the audacity to preside over a monastery without even having learnt the system of the Elders, and appoint ourselves Abbots before we have, as we ought, professed ourselves disciples, and are readier to require the observance of our own inventions than to preserve the well-tried teaching of our predecessors. But, while we meant to explain the best system of prayers to be observed, we have in our eagerness for the institutions of the fathers anticipated by a hasty digression the account which we were keeping back for its proper place. And so let us now return to the subject before us.","title":"Book II.

Then, too, will he understand the reason of the priests and Levites, and of the different priestly orders, the type of which was in Moses, and also what is the true meaning of the jubilees, and of the weeks of years with God. He will see also the reasons for the festival days, and holy days, and for all the sacrifices and purifications. He will perceive also the reason of the purgation from leprosy, and what the different kinds of leprosy are, and the reason of the purgation of those who lose their seed. He will come to know, moreover, what are the good influences,[fn-67-P6750_1410809:198-nf] and their greatness, and their qualities; and those too which are of a contrary kind, and what the affection of the former, and what the strife-causing emulation of the latter is towards men. He will behold also the nature of the soul, and the diversity of animals (whether of those which live in the water, or of birds, or of wild beasts), and why each of the genera is subdivided into so many species; and what intention of the Creator, or what purpose of His wisdom, is concealed in each individual thing. He will become acquainted, too, with the reason why certain properties are found associated with certain roots or herbs, and why, on the other hand, evil effects are averted by other herbs and roots. He will know, moreover, the nature of the apostate angels, and the reason why they have power to flatter in some things those who do not despise them with the whole power of faith, and why they exist for the purpose of deceiving and leading men astray. He will learn, too, the judgment of Divine Providence on each individual thing; and that, of those events which happen to men, none occur by accident or chance, but in accordance with a plan so carefully considered, and so stupendous, that it does not overlook even the number of the hairs of the heads, not merely of the saints, but perhaps of all human beings, and the plan of which providential government extends even to caring for the sale of two sparrows for a denarius, whether sparrows there be understood figuratively or literally. Now indeed this providential government is still a subject of investigation, but then it will be fully manifested. From all which we are to suppose, that meanwhile not a little time may pass by until the reason of those things only which are upon the earth be pointed out to the worthy and deserving after their departure from life, that by the knowledge of all these things, and by the grace of full knowledge, they may enjoy an unspeakable joy.

For in writing to the Thessalonians, and at first, like a skilful and excellent physician, applying to the infirmity of his patients the soothing and gentle remedy of his words, and beginning with charity, and praising them in that point, that[fn-30-P3063_1186200:6-nf] this deadly wound, having been treated with a milder remedy, might lose its angry fostering and more easily bear severer treatment, he says: \"But concerning brotherly charity ye have no need that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another. For this ye do toward all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia.\"[fn-30-P3064_1186608:7-nf] He first began with the soothing application of praise, and made their ears submissive and ready for the remedy of the healing words. Then he proceeds: \"But we ask you, brethren, to abound more.\" Thus far he soothes them with kind and gentle words; for fear lest he should find them not yet prepared to receive their perfect cure. Why is it that you ask, O Apostle, that they may abound more in charity, of which you had said above, \"But concerning brotherly charity we have no need to write to you\"? And why is it necessary that you should say to them: \"But we ask you to abound more,\" when they did not need o be written to at all on this matter? especially as you add the reason why they do not need it, saying, \"For you yourselves have been aught of God to love one another.\" And you add a third thing still more important: hat not only have they been taught of God, but also that they fulfil in deed that which they are taught. \"For ye do this,\" he says, not to one or two, but \"to all the brethren;\" and not to your own citizens and friends only, but \"in the whole of Macedonia.\" Tell us then, I pray, why it is that you so particularly begin with this. Again he proceeds, \"But we ask you, brethren, to abound the more.\" And with difficulty at last he breaks out into that at which he was driving before: \"and that ye take pains to be quiet.\" He gave the first aim. Then he adds a second, \"and to do your own business;\" and a third as well: \"and work with your own hands, as we commanded you;\" a fourth: \"and to walk honestly towards those that are without;\"a fifth: \"and to covet no man's goods.\" Lo, we can see through that hesitation, which made him with these preludes put off uttering what his mind was full of: \"And that ye take pains to be quiet;\" i.e., that you stop in your cells, and be not disturbed by rumours, which generally spring from the wishes and gossip of idle persons, and so yourselves disturb others. And, \"to do your own business,\" you should not want to require curiously of the world's actions, or, examining the lives of others, want to spend your strength, not on bettering yourselves and aiming at virtue, but on depreciating your brethren. \"And work with your own hands, as we charged you;\" to secure that which he had warned them above not to do; i.e., that they should not be restless and anxious about other people's affairs, nor walk dishonestly towards those without, nor covet another man's goods, he now adds and says, \"and work with your own hands, as we charged you.\" For he has clearly shown that leisure the reason why those things were done which he blamed above. For no one can be restless or anxious about other people's affairs, but one who is not satisfied to apply himself to the work of his own hands. He adds also a fourth evil, which springs also from this leisure, i.e., that they should not walk dishonestly: when he says: \"And that ye walk honestly towards those without.\" He cannot possibly walk honestly, even among those who are men of this world, who is not content to cling to the seclusion of his cell and the work of his own hands; but he is sure to be dishonest, while he seeks his needful food; and to take pains to flatter, to follow up news and gossip, to seek for opportunities for chattering and stories by means of which he may gain a footing and obtain an entrance into the houses of others. \"And that you should not covet another man's goods.\" He is sure to look with envious eyes on another's gifts and boons, who does not care to secure sufficient for his daily food by the dutiful and peaceful labour of his hands. You see what conditions, and how serious and shameful ones, spring solely from the malady of leisure. Lastly, those very people, whom in his first Epistle he had treated with the gentle application of his words, in his second Epistle he en-deavours to heal with severer and sterner remedies, as those who had not profited by more gentle treatment; and he no longer applies the treatment of gentle words, no mild and kindly expressions, as these, \"But we ask you, brethren,\" but \"We adjure you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother that walketh disorderly.\"[fn-30-P3065_1190829:8-nf] There he asks; here he adjures. There is the kindness of one who is persuading; here the sternness of one protesting and threatening. \"We adjure you, brethren:\" because, when we first asked you, you scorned to listen; now at least obey our threats. And this adjuration he renders terrible, not by his bare word, but by the imprecation of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: for fear lest they might again scorn it, as merely man's word, and think that it was not of much importance. And forthwith, like a well-skilled physician with festering limbs, to which he could not apply the remedy of a mild treatment, he tries to cure by an incision with a spiritual knife, saying, \"that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not according to the tradition which ye received of us.\" And so he bids them withdraw from those who will not make time for work, and to cut them off like limbs tainted with the festering sores of leisure: test the the malady of idleness, like some deadly con tagion, might infect even the healthy portionof their limbs, by the gradual advance of infection. And when he is going to speak ofthose who will not work with their own hands and eat their bread in quietness, from whom he urges them to withdraw, hear with what reproaches he brands them at starting.

for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God.\"[fn-98-P9898_2585507:70-nf] Then, again, after this, knowing that there were others dead in Christ besides himself and such as he, he subjoins the words, \"The dead in Christ shall rise first; then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.\"[fn-98-P9899_2585817:71-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"145","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Basilides, in the twenty-third book of the Exegetics, respecting those that are punished by martyrdom, expresses himself in the following language: \"For I say this, Whosoever fall under the afflictions mentioned, in consequence of unconsciously transgressing in other matters, are brought to this good end by the kindness of Him who brings them, but accused on other grounds; so that they may not suffer as condemned for what are owned to be iniquities, nor reproached as the adulterer or the murderer, but because they are Christians; which will console them, so that they do not appear to suffer. And if one who has not sinned at all incur suffering-a rare case-yet even he will not suffer aught through the machinations of power, but will suffer as the child which seems not to have sinned would suffer.\" Then further on he adds: \"As, then, the child which has not sinned before, or committed actual sin in itself, but has that which committed sin, when subjected to suffering, gets good, reaping the advantage of many difficulties; so also, although a perfect man may not have sinned in act, while he endures afflictions, he suffers similarly with the child. Having within him the sinful principle, but not embracing the opportunity of committing sin, he does not sin; so that he is not to be reckoned as not having sinned. For as he who wishes to commit adultery is an adulterer, although he does not succeed in committing adultery; and he that wishes to commit murder is a murderer, although he is unable to kill; so also, if I see the man without sin, whom I specify, suffering, though he have done nothing bad, I should call him bad, on account of his wishing to sin. For I will affirm anything rather than call Providence evil.\" Then, in continuation, he says expressly concerning the Lord, as concerning man: \"If then, passing from all these observations, you were to proceed to put me to shame by saying, perchance impersonating certain parties, This man has then sinned; for this man has suffered;-if you permit, I will say, He has not sinned; but was like a child suffering. If you were to insist more urgently, I would say, That the man you name is man, but that God is righteous: `` For no one is pure, ''as one said, `from pollution.'\"[fn-68-P6845_2090243:118-nf] But the hypothesis of Basilides[fn-68-P6846_2090295:119-nf] says that the soul, having sinned before in another life, endures punishment in this-the elect soul with honour by martyrdom, the other purged by appropriate punishment. How can this be true, when the confessing and suffering punishment or not depends on ourselves? For in the case of the man who shall deny, Providence, as held by Basilides, is done away with. I will ask him, then, in the case of a confessor who has been arrested, whether he will confess and be punished in virtue of Providence or not? For in the case of denying he will not be punished. But if, for the sake of escaping and evading the necessity of punishing such an one, he shall say that the destruction of those who shall deny is of Providence, he will be a martyr against his will. And how any more is it the case, that there is laid up in heaven the very glorious recompense to him who has witnessed, for his witnessing? If Providence did not permit the sinner to get the length of sinning, it is unjust in both cases; both in not rescuing the man who is dragged to punishment for righteousness' sake, and in having rescued him who wished to do wrong, he having done it as far as volition was concerned, but [Providence] having prevented the deed, and unjustly favoured the sinner. And how impious, in deifying the devil, and in daring to call the Lord a sinful man! For the devil tempting us, knowing what we are, but not knowing if we will hold out, but wishing to dislodge us from the faith, attempts also to bring us into subjection to himself. Which is all that is allowed to him, partly from the necessity of saving us, who have taken occasion from the commandment, from ourselves; partly for the confusion of him who has tempted and failed; for the confirmation of the members of the Church, and the conscience of those who admire the constancy [displayed]. But if martyrdom be retribution by way of punishment, then also faith and doctrine, on account of which martyrdom comes, are co-operators in punishment-than which, what other absurdity could be greater? But with reference to these dogmas, whether the soul is changed to another body, also of the devil, at the proper time mention will be made. But at present, to what has been already said, let us add the following: Where any more is faith in the retribution of sins committed before martyrdom takes place? And where is love to God, which is persecuted and endures for the truth? And where is the praise of him who has confessed, or the censure of him who has denied? And for what use is right conduct, the mortification of the lusts, and the hating of no creature? But if, as Basilides himself says, we suppose one part of the declared will of God to be the loving of all things because all things bear a relation to the whole, and another \"not to lust after anything,\" and a third \"not to hate anything,\" by the will of God these also will be punishments, which it were impious to think. For neither did the Lord suffer by the will of the Father, nor are those who are persecuted by the will of God; since either of two things is the case: either persecution in consequence of the will of God is a good thing, or those who decree and afflict are guiltless. But nothing is without the will of the Lord of the universe. It remains to say that such things happen without the prevention of God; for this alone saves both the providence and the goodness of God. We must not therefore think that He actively produces afflictions (far be it that we should think this!); but we must be persuaded that He does not prevent those that cause them, but overrules for good the crimes of His enemies: \"I will therefore,\" He says, \"destroy the wall, and it shall be for treading under foot.\"[fn-68-P6847_2094279:120-nf] Providence being a disciplinary art;[fn-68-P6848_2094334:121-nf] in the case of others for each individual's sins, and in the case of the Lord and His apostles for ours. To this point says the divine apostle: \"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication: that each one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; not in the lust of concupiscence, as the Gentiles who know not the Lord: that none of you should overreach or take advantage of his brother in any matter; because the Lord is the avenger in respect of all such, as we also told you before, and testified. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but to holiness. Wherefore he that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given His Holy Spirit to you.\"[fn-68-P6849_2095192:122-nf] Wherefore the Lord was not prohibited from this sanctification of ours. if, then, one of them were to say, in reply, that the martyr is punished for sins committed before this embodying, and that he will again reap the fruit of his conduct in this life, for that such are the arrangements of the [divine administration], we shall ask him if the retribution takes place by Providence. For if it be not of the divine administration, the economy of expiations is gone, and their hypothesis falls to the ground; but if expiations are by Providence, punishments are by Providence too. But Providence, although it begins, so to speak, to move with the Ruler, yet is implanted in substances along with their origin by the God of the universe. Such being the case, they must confess either that punish-merit is not just, and those who condemn and persecute the martyrs do right, or that persecutions even are wrought by the will of God. Labour and fear are not, then, as they say, incident to affairs as rust to iron, but come upon the soul through its own will. And on these points there is much to say, which will be reserved for future consideration, taking them up in due course.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":4,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_67_book_vi_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"483","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For, in truth, the covenant of salvation, reaching down to us from the foundation of the world, through different generations and times, is one, though conceived as different in respect of gift.

Thus, as we said above, practical knowledge is distributed among many subjects and interests, but theoretical is divided into two parts, i.e., the historical interpretation and the spiritual sense. Whence also Solomon when he had summed up the manifold grace of the Church, added: \"for all who are with her are clothed with double garments.\"[fn-54-P5478_1960098:8-nf] But of spiritual knowledge there are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical,[fn-54-P5479_1960213:9-nf] of which we read as follows in Proverbs: \"But do you describe these things to yourself in three ways according to the largeness of your heart.\"[fn-54-P5480_1961149:10-nf] And so the history embraces the knowledge of things past and visible, as it is repeated in this way by the Apostle: \"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he who was of the free was by promise.\" But to the allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to have prefigured the form of some mystery \"For these,\" says he, \"are the two covenants the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth into bondage, which is Agar. For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is compared to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.\" But the anagogical sense rises from spiritual mysteries even to still more sublime and sacred secrets of heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in these words: \"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate more than of her that hath an husband.\"[fn-54-P5481_1962255:11-nf] The tropological sense is the moral explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: \"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.\"[fn-54-P5482_1962637:12-nf] And so these four previously mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses: historically as the city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of Christ, anagogically as the heavenly city of God \"which is the mother of us all,\" tropologically, as the soul of man, which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title. Of these four kinds of interpretation the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by doctrine?\"[fn-54-P5483_1963322:13-nf] For \"revelation\" belongs to allegory whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is revealed in its spiritual sense and interpretation, as for instance if we tried to expound how \"all our fathers were under the cloud and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea,\" and how they \"all ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ.\"[fn-54-P5484_1963776:14-nf] And this explanation where there is a comparison of the figure of the body and blood of Christ which we receive daily, contains the allegorical sense. But the knowledge, which is in the same way mentioned by the Apostle, is tropological, as by it we can by a careful study see of all things that have to do with practical discernment whether they are useful and good, as in this case, when we are told to judge of our own selves \"whether it is fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered.\"[fn-54-P5485_1964301:15-nf] And this system, as has been said, contains the moral meaning. So \"prophecy\" which the Apostle puts in the third place, alludes to the anagogical sense by which the words are applied to things future and invisible, as here: \"But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those that sleep: that ye be not sorry as others also who have no hope. For if we believe that Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say to you by the word of God, that we which are alive at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent those that sleep in Christ, for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.\"[fn-54-P5486_1965091:16-nf] In which kind of exhortation the figure of anagoge is brought forward. But \"doctrine\" unfolds the simple course of historical exposition, under which is contained no more secret sense, but what is declared by the very words: as in this passage: \"For I delivered unto you first of all what I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again on the third day, and that he was seen of Cephas;\"[fn-54-P5487_1965583:17-nf] and: \"God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;\"[fn-54-P5488_1965706:18-nf] or this: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord the God is one Lord.\"[fn-54-P5489_1965783:19-nf] ","title":"XIV.

To his sisters he was dead, to the Lord he was asleep. He was dead to men, who could not raise him again; but the Lord aroused him with as great ease from the tomb as one arouseth a sleeper from his bed. Hence it was in reference to His own power that He spoke of him as sleeping: for others also, who are dead, are frequently spoken of in Scripture as sleeping; as when the apostle says, \"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope.\"[fn-21-P2123_1312964:14-nf] Therefore he also spoke of them as sleeping, because foretelling their resurrection. And so, all the dead are sleeping, both good and bad. But just as, in the case of those who sleep and waken day by day, there is a great difference as to what they severally see in their sleep: some experience pleasant dreams; others. dreams so frightful that the waking are afraid to fall asleep for fear of their recurrence: so every individual sleeps and wakens in circumstances peculiar to himself. And there is a difference as to the kind of custody one may be placed in, who is afterwards to be taken before the judge. For the kind of custody in which men are placed depends on the merits of the case: some are required to be guarded by lictors, an office humane and mild, and becoming a citizen; others are given up to subordinates;[fn-21-P2124_1313811:15-nf] some, again, are sent to prison: and in the prison itself all are not thrust together into its lowest dungeons, but dealt with in proportion to the merits and superior gravity of the charges. As, then, there are different kinds of custody among those engaged in official life, so there are different kinds of custody for the dead, and differing merits in those who rise again. The beggar was taken into custody, so was the rich man: but the one into Abraham's bosom; the other, where he thirsted, and found not a drop of water.[fn-21-P2125_1314932:16-nf] ","title":"Tractate XLIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_178_letter_clx","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"5.

O man, do not make the aunt the little one's stepmother; do not arm with implacable jealousy her who ought to cherish them with a mother's love.

Let no one condemn me for other men's errors nor adduce letters written twenty years ago in proof that I would allow communion to the writers of such things. Before these things were written, and before any suspicion of this kind had been stirred against them, I did write as layman to layman. I wrote nothing about the faith in any way like that which they are now carrying about to calumniate me. I sent nothing but a mere greeting to return a friendly communication, for I shun and anathematize as impious alike all who are affected with the unsoundness of Sabellius, and all who maintain the opinions of Arius. If any one says that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are the same, and supposes one thing under several names, and one hypostasis described by three persons, I rank such an one as belonging to the faction of the Jews.[fn-53-P5380_1696471:14-nf] Similarly, if any one says that the Son is in essence unlike the Father, or degrades the Holy Ghost into a creature, I anathematize him, and say that he is coming near to the heathen error.
