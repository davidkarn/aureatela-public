{"verses":["Therefore if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are\nabove, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.","Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the\nearth.","For you are dead:  and your life is hid with Christ in God.","When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall\nappear with him in glory.","Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth:\nfornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence and covetousness,\nwhich is the service of idols.","For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of\nunbelief.","In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.","But now put you also all away:  anger, indignation, malice,\nblasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.","Lie not one to another:  stripping yourselves of the old man with\nhis deeds,","And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge,\naccording to the image of him that created him.","Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor\nuncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free.  But Christ is\nall and in all.","Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, the\nbowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:","Bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any have a\ncomplaint against another.  Even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do\nyou also.","But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of\nperfection.","And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also\nyou are called in one body:  and be ye thankful.","Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly:  in all wisdom,\nteaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns and spiritual\ncanticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.","All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of\nthe Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.","Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord.","Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter towards them.","Children, obey your parents in all things:  for this is well\npleasing to the Lord.","Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be\ndiscouraged.","Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh:\nnot serving to the eye, as pleasing men:  but in simplicity of heart,\nfearing God.","Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not\nto men:","Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of\ninheritance.  Serve ye the Lord Christ.","For he that doth wrong shall receive for that which he hath done\nwrongfully.  And there is no respect of persons with God."]}
