Such arguments are mere makeshifts and pretexts, the marks of idleness and sloth. But some one will say, \"it is to the priests that these charges are given:\"-certainly, for they are the subjects of our discourse. But that the apostle gives the same charge to the laity, hear what he says in another epistle to other than the priesthood: \"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom,\"[fn-5-P515_257365:59-nf] and again, \"Let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one,\"[fn-5-P516_257505:60-nf] and there is a general charge to all that they \"be ready to\"[fn-5-P517_257585:61-nf] render an account of their faith, and to the Thessalonians, he gives the following command: \"Build each other up, even as also ye do.\"[fn-5-P518_257741:62-nf] But when he speaks of priests he says, \"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word, and in teaching.\"[fn-5-P519_257927:63-nf] For this is the perfection of teaching when the teachers both by what they do, and by what they say as well, bring their disciples to that blessed state of life which Christ appointed for them. For example alone is not enough to instruct others. Nor do I say this of myself; it is our Saviour's own word. \"For whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great.[fn-5-P520_258317:64-nf] Now if doing were the same as teaching, the second word here would be superfluous; and it had been enough to have said \"whosoever shall do\" simply. But now by distinguishing the two, he shows that practice is one thing, and doctrine another, and that each needs the help of the others in order to complete edification. Thou hearest too what the chosen vessel of Christ says to the Ephesian elders: \"Wherefore watch ye, remembering that for the space of three years, I ceased not to admonish every one, night and day, with tears.\" But what need was there for his tears or for admonition by word of mouth, while his life as an apostle was so illustrious?

And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere.

What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: \"And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\"?[fn-63-P6397_2448741:47-nf] Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance?

And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: \"We say, 'Hallowed be Thy name,' not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows?

And, in my opinion, he who is solicitous about truth ought not to frame his language with artfulness and care, but only to try to express his meaning as he best can. For those who are particular about words, and devote their time to them, miss the things.[fn-56-P5632_1701041:6-nf] It is a feat fit for the gardener to pluck without injury the rose that is growing among the thorns; and for the craftsman to find out the pearl buried in the oyster's flesh.

But that this Luke was inseparable from Paul, and his fellow-labourer in the Gospel, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as bound to do so by the truth itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and John who was called Mark, had parted company from Paul, and sailed to Cyprus, \"we came to Troas; \"[fn-76-P7622_2066992:232-nf] and when Paul had beheld in a dream a man of Macedonia, saying, \"Come into Macedonia, Paul, and help us,\" \"immediately,\" he says, \"we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, understanding that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel unto them. Therefore, sailing from Troas, we directed our ship's course towards Samothracia.\" And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their journey as far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address: \"for, sitting down,\" he says, \"we spake unto the women who had assembled; \"[fn-76-P7623_2067544:233-nf] and certain believed, even a great many. And again does he say, \"But we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to Troas, where we abode seven days.\"[fn-76-P7624_2067741:234-nf] And all the remaining [details] of his course with Paul he recounts, indicating with all diligence both places, and cities, and number of days, until they went up to Jerusalem; and what befell Paul there,[fn-76-P7625_2067968:235-nf] how he was sent to Rome in bonds; the name of the centurion who took him in charge;[fn-76-P7626_2068069:236-nf] and the signs of the ships, and how they made shipwreck;[fn-76-P7627_2068145:237-nf] and the island upon which they escaped, and how they received kindness there, Paul healing the chief man of that island; and how they sailed from thence to Puteoli, and from that arrived at Rome; and for what period they sojourned at Rome. As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he carefully noted them down in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of falsehood or boastfulness, because all these [particulars] proved both that he was senior to all those who now teach otherwise, and that he was not ignorant of the truth. That he was not merely a follower, but also a fellow-labourer of the apostles, but especially of Paul, Paul has himself declared also in the Epistles, saying: \"Demas hath forsaken me, ... and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me.\"[fn-76-P7628_2068986:238-nf] From this he shows that he was always attached to and inseparable from him.

And if any one will defend such language on account of the meaning which is conveyed under the name of Zeus, thus speaking in the dialogue of Plato, why should not he who investigates the meaning of the words of the Son of God, or those of the Creator ([fn-102-P10263_2723009:51-nf] in the prophets, express a profounder meaning than any conveyed by the words of Zeus in the Timaeus? For the characteristic of divinity is the announcement of future events, predicted not by human power, but shown by the result to be due to a divine spirit in him who made the announcement. Accordingly, we do not say to each of our hearers, \"Believe, first of all, that He whom I introduce to thee is the Son of God; \"but we put the Gospel before each one, as his character and disposition may fit him to receive it, inasmuch as we have learned to know \"how we ought to answer every man.\"[fn-102-P10264_2723622:52-nf] And there are some who are capable of receiving nothing more than an exhortation to believe, and to these we address that alone; while we approach others, again, as far as possible, in the way of demonstration, by means of question and answer. Nor do we at all say, as Celsus scoffingly alleges, \"Believe that he whom I introduce to thee is the Son of God, although he was shamefully bound, and disgracefully punished, and very recently[fn-102-P10265_2724080:53-nf] was most contumeliously treated before the eyes of all men; \"neither do we add, \"Believe it even the more (on that account).\" For it is our endeavour to state, on each individual point, arguments more numerous even than we have brought forward in the preceding pages.

Augustin answered: I seemed too a little while ago, when we were disputing about the oil of the sinner, to anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared, whether you yourself were not a sinner. You have had the hardihood to say as much. What a portentous sin! For in that you assert yourself to be a priest, what else have you maintained by quoting this testimony of the prophet, save that you are wholly without sin? For if you have sin, who is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the words? For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people, quoting from the prophet: \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?[fn-54-P5499_2661755:334-nf] to the intent that they may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping away their sins to your prayers. Truly ye are great men, exalted above your fellows, heavenly, godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for the people, and will not have the people pray for you! Are you more righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who was wont to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught? \"Continue,\" he says, \"in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.\"[fn-55-P5500_2662496:335-nf] See how prayer is made for an apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop. Do you perceive of how devilish a nature your pride is? Prayer is made for an apostle, that he may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak. Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you ought not. Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-55-P5501_2663050:336-nf] Finally, are you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very epistle, going so far as to say, \"The most righteous king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?\"-a thing which he never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, \"Thy God, whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.\"[fn-55-P5502_2663476:337-nf] But on this subject we have already said much. With regard to the question now before us, viz., that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony, though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with you, but by the testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only men that could be saved from a certain excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all the rest.[fn-55-P5503_2664027:338-nf] A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous for righteousness, prays, and says, \"While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God.\"[fn-55-P5504_2664306:339-nf] And you say that you are without sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if the people sin, you pray for them: but if you sin, who shall pray for you? For clearly by the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the prophet would have to be understood in these words, which you do not understand. For now that no one may ask why this was said, I will explain it so far as by God's grace I shall be able. God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a Priest of such a sort that none should pray for Him. He was Himself prefigured in the times of the first people and the first temple, in which all things were figures for our ensample. Therefore the high priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that inner sanctuary;[fn-55-P5505_2665220:340-nf] just as our High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies, whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here.[fn-55-P5506_2665407:341-nf] It is with this reference that the prophet says, \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?\" Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor need that one should pray for him. And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by the people;[fn-55-P5507_2665762:342-nf] but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not made. Hear John confessing this, and saying, \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-55-P5508_2666101:343-nf] \"We have,\" he says; and \"for our sins.\" I pray you, learn humility, that you may not fall, or rather, that in time you may arise again.

For we see many that come to be with one another for evil, even by the law of marriage, and this we should not ascribe to God. But as He said Himself, \"He which made them at the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall leave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh.\" (Matt. xix. 4, Matt. xix. 5; Gen. ii. 24.) And this is what that wise man meant to explain. For since equality of honor does many times lead to fightings, He hath made many governments and forms of subjection; as that, for instance, of man and wife, that of son and father, that of old men and young, that of bond and free,[fn-30-P3072_2882993:2-nf] that of ruler and ruled, that of master and disciple. And why are you surprised in the case of mankind, when even in the body He hath done the same thing? For even here He hath not made all parts of equal honor, but He hath made one less and another greater, and some of the limbs hath He made to rule and some to be ruled. And among the unreasoning creatures one may notice this same principle, as amongst bees, amongst cranes, amongst herds of wild cattle. And even the sea itself is not without this goodly subordination; for there too many of the clans are ranged under one among the fishes, and are led thus as an army, and make long expeditions from home. For anarchy, be where it may, is an evil, and a cause of confusion. After having said then whence governments come, he proceeds, \"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.\" See what he has led the subject on to, and how fearful he makes it, and how he shows this to be a matter of debt. For lest the believers should say, You are making us very cheap and despicable, when you put us, who are to enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven, under subjection to rulers, he shows that it is not to rulers, but to God again that he makes them subject in doing this. For it is to Him, that he who subjects himself to authorities is obedient. Yet he does not say this-for instance that it is God to Whom a man who listens to authorities is obedient-but he uses the opposite case to awe them, and gives it a more precise form by saying, that he who listeneth not thereto is fighting with God, Who framed these laws. And this he is in all cases at pains to show, that it is not by way of favor that we obey them, but by way of debt. For in this way he was more likely to draw the governors who were unbelievers to religion, and the believers to obedience. For there was quite a common report in those days (Tert. Ap. 1, 31, 32), which maligned the Apostles, as guilty of a sedition and revolutionary scheme, and as aiming in all they did and said at the subversion of the received institutions. When then you show our common Master giving this in charge to all His, you will at once stop the mouths of those that malign us as revolutionists, and with great boldness will speak for the doctrines of truth. Be not then ashamed, he says, at such subjection. For God hath laid down this law, and is a strong Avenger of them if they be despised. For it is no common punishment that He will exact of thee, if thou disobey, but the very greatest; and nothing will exempt thee, that thou canst say to the contrary, but both of men thou shalt undergo the most severe vengeance, and there shall be no one to defend thee, and thou wilt also provoke God the more.

For since equality of honor does many times lead to fightings, He hath made many governments and forms of subjection; as that, for instance, of man and wife, that of son and father, that of old men and young, that of bond and free,[fn-30-P3072_2882993:2-nf] that of ruler and ruled, that of master and disciple. And why are you surprised in the case of mankind, when even in the body He hath done the same thing? For even here He hath not made all parts of equal honor, but He hath made one less and another greater, and some of the limbs hath He made to rule and some to be ruled. And among the unreasoning creatures one may notice this same principle, as amongst bees, amongst cranes, amongst herds of wild cattle. And even the sea itself is not without this goodly subordination; for there too many of the clans are ranged under one among the fishes, and are led thus as an army, and make long expeditions from home. For anarchy, be where it may, is an evil, and a cause of confusion. After having said then whence governments come, he proceeds, \"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.\" See what he has led the subject on to, and how fearful he makes it, and how he shows this to be a matter of debt. For lest the believers should say, You are making us very cheap and despicable, when you put us, who are to enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven, under subjection to rulers, he shows that it is not to rulers, but to God again that he makes them subject in doing this. For it is to Him, that he who subjects himself to authorities is obedient. Yet he does not say this-for instance that it is God to Whom a man who listens to authorities is obedient-but he uses the opposite case to awe them, and gives it a more precise form by saying, that he who listeneth not thereto is fighting with God, Who framed these laws. And this he is in all cases at pains to show, that it is not by way of favor that we obey them, but by way of debt. For in this way he was more likely to draw the governors who were unbelievers to religion, and the believers to obedience. For there was quite a common report in those days (Tert. Ap. 1, 31, 32), which maligned the Apostles, as guilty of a sedition and revolutionary scheme, and as aiming in all they did and said at the subversion of the received institutions. When then you show our common Master giving this in charge to all His, you will at once stop the mouths of those that malign us as revolutionists, and with great boldness will speak for the doctrines of truth. Be not then ashamed, he says, at such subjection. For God hath laid down this law, and is a strong Avenger of them if they be despised. For it is no common punishment that He will exact of thee, if thou disobey, but the very greatest; and nothing will exempt thee, that thou canst say to the contrary, but both of men thou shalt undergo the most severe vengeance, and there shall be no one to defend thee, and thou wilt also provoke God the more.
