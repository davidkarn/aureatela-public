But He commanded His own Son, the first-begotten,[fn-12-P1258_548912:90-nf] the maker of all things, His own counsellor, to descend from heaven, that He might transfer the sacred religion of God to the Gentiles,[fn-12-P1259_549124:91-nf] that is, to those who were ignorant of God, and might teach them righteousness, which the perfidious people had cast aside· And He had long before threatened that He would do this, as the prophet Malachi[fn-12-P1260_549346:92-nf] shows, saying: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, and I will not accept an offering from your hands; for from the rising of the sun even unto its setting, my name shall be great[fn-12-P1261_549554:93-nf] among the Gentiles.\" David also in the seventeenth Psalm[fn-12-P1262_549669:94-nf] says: \"Thou wilt make me the head of the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall serve me\" Isaiah[fn-12-P1263_549885:95-nf] also thus speaks: \"I come to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory; and I will send among them a sign, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations which are afar off, which have not heard my fame; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.\" Therefore, when God wished to send to the earth one who should measure[fn-12-P1264_550327:96-nf] His temple, He was unwilling to send him with heavenly power and glory, that the people who had been ungrateful towards God might be led into the greatest error, and suffer punishment for their crimes, since they had not received their Lord and God, as the prophets had before foretold that it would thus happen.

But however this may be, justice requires us to remember, in considering his transgression, that from his very childhood he had been surrounded by a condition of civilisation presenting manifold temptations. Carthage, where he spent a large part of his life, had become, since its restoration and colonization under Augustus Caesar, an \"exceeding great city,\" in wealth and importance next to Rome.[fn-1-P165_25298:17-nf] \"African Paganism,\" says Pressensé,[fn-1-P166_26976:18-nf] \"was half Asiatic; the ancient worship of nature, the adoration of Astarte, had full licence in the city of Carthage; Dido had become a mythological being, whom this dissolute city had made its protecting divinity, and it is easy to recognise in her the great goddess of Phoenicia under a new name.\" The luxury of the period is described by Jerome and Tertullian, when they denounce the custom of painting the face and tiring the head, and the prodigality that would give 25,000 golden crowns for a veil, immense revenues for a pair of ear-rings, and the value of a forest or an island for a head-dress. And Jerome, in one of his epistles, gives an illustration of the Church's relation to the Pagan world at that time, when he represents an old priest of Jupiter with his grand-daughter, a catechumen, on his knee, who responds to his caresses by singing canticles.[fn-1-P167_27921:19-nf] It was a time when we can imagine one of Augustin's parents going to the Colosseum, and enjoying the lasciviousness of its displays, and its gladiatorial shows, with their contempt of human life; while the other carefully shunned such scenes, as being under the ban of the teachers of the Church.[fn-1-P168_31044:20-nf] It was an age in which there was action and reaction between religion and philosophy; but in which the power of Christianity was so great in its influences on Paganism, that some received the Christian Scriptures only to embody in their phraseology the ideas of heathenism. Of this last point Manichaeanism presents an illustration. Now all these influences left their mark on Augustin. In his youth he plunged deep into the pleasures of his day; and we know how he endeavoured to find in Manichaeanism a solution of those speculations which haunted his subtle and inquiring mind. Augustin at this time, then, is not to be taken as a type of what Christianity produced. He is to a great extent the outgrowth of the Pagan influences of the time. Considerations such as these may enable us to judge of his early sin more justly than if we measured it by our own privileges and opportunities.","title":"Translator's Preface","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_10_book_vi_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"ANF-05","text":"All the prophets, therefore, and the law spoke by means of the Demiurge,-a silly god,[fn-16-P1606_478065:93-nf] he says, (and themselves) fools, who knew nothing.

Jesus, however, the new man, (has been generated) from the Holy Spirit-that is, Sophia and the Demiurge-in order that the Demiurge may complete the conformation and constitution of his body, and that the Holy Spirit may supply his essence, and that a celestial Logos may proceed from the Ogdoad being born of Mary.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_07_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"13. \"Blessed are ye,\" says He, \"when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.

What, then, we have alleged by way of example of a single wise man, although of one still bearing a mortal body and still seeing only in part, may be allowably extended also to a family, where there is a society of such men, or to a city, or even to the whole world, if the chief rule and government of human affairs were in the hands of the wise, and of those who were piously and perfectly subject to God; but because this is not the case as yet (for it behoves us first to be exercised in this our pilgrimage after mortal fashion, and to be taught with stripes by force of gentleness and patience), let us turn our thoughts to that country itself that is above and heavenly, from which we here are pilgrims.

But because these things are known to men, in that they are done by men, they may well meet with reverence as being holy things, but they cannot cause wonder as being miracles. And therefore those things which are done by angels are the more wonderful to us, in that they are more difficult and more known; but they are known and easy to them as being their own actions. An angel speaks in the person of God to man, saying, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;\" the Scripture having said just before, \"The angel of the Lord appeared to him.\"[fn-7-P748_286662:49-nf] And a man also speaks in the person of God, saying, \"Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee, O Israel: I am the Lord thy God.\"[fn-7-P749_286818:50-nf] A rod was taken to serve as a sign, and was changed into a serpent by angelical power;[fn-7-P750_286928:51-nf] but although that power is wanting to man, yet a stone was taken also by man for a similar sign.[fn-7-P751_287043:52-nf] There is a wide difference between the deed of the angel and the deed of the man. The former is both to be wondered at and to be understood, the latter only to be understood. That which is understood from both, is perhaps one and the same; but those things from which it is understood, are different. Just as if the name of God were written both in gold and in ink; the former would be the more precious, the latter the more worthless; yet that which is signified in both is one and the same. And although the serpent that came from Moses' rod signified the same thing as Jacob's stone, yet Jacob's stone signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians. For as the anointing of the stone signified Christ in the flesh, in which He was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows;[fn-7-P752_287871:53-nf] so the rod of Moses, turned into a serpent, signified Christ Himself made obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.[fn-7-P753_288012:54-nf] Whence it is said, \"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life;.\"[fn-7-P754_288226:55-nf] just as by gazing on that serpent which was lifted up in the wilderness, they did not perish by the bites of the serpents.

Therefore the rod passed into the serpent, Christ into death; and the serpent again into the rod, whole Christ with His body into the resurrection; which body is the Church;[fn-7-P757_288805:58-nf] and this shall be in the end of time, signified by the tail, which Moses held, in order that it might return into a rod.[fn-7-P758_288943:59-nf] But the serpents of the magicians, like those who are dead in the world, unless by believing in Christ they shall have been as it were swallowed up by,[fn-7-P759_289111:60-nf] and have entered into, His body, will not be able to rise again in Him. Jacob's stone, therefore, as I said, signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians; yet the deed of the magicians was much more wonderful.

He renders it, on the one hand, impossible to rate too highly the dignity of man, created to share the nature and the life of God; impossible, on the other hand, to estimate highly enough the condescension of Christ in assuming humanity. It is by His humiliation that we are saved; by the fact that the nature of man was taken by his Maker, not by the fact that Christ, being man, remained sinless. For sin began against God's will and after His counsel was formed; it might deflect the march of His purpose towards fulfilment, but could no more impede its consummation than it could cause its inception. The true salvation of man is not that which rescues him, when corrupt, from sin and its consequences, but that which raises him, corruptible, because free, even though he had not become corrupt, into the safety of union with the nature of God. Human life, though pure from actual sin, would have been aimless and hopeless without the Incarnation. And the human body would have had no glory, for its glory is that Christ has taken it, worn it awhile in its imperfect state, laid it aside and finally resumed it in its perfection. All this He must have done, in accordance with God's purpose, even though the Fall had never occurred. Hence the Incarnation and the Resurrection are the facts of paramount interest; the death of Christ, corresponding as it does to the hypothetical laying aside of the unglorified flesh, loses something of its usual prominence in Christian thought. It is represented as being primarily for Christ the moment of transition, for the Christian the act which enables him to profit by the Incarnation; but it is the Incarnation itself whereby, in Hilary's words, we are saved into the nature and the name of God. But though we may feel that this great truth is not stated in its full impressiveness, we must allow that the thought which has taken the foremost place is no mere academic speculation. And, after all, sin and the Atonement are copiouslytreated in his writings, though they do not control his exposition of the Incarnation. Yet even in this there are large spaces of his argument where these considerations have a place, though only to give local colour, so to speak, and a sense of reality to the description of a purpose formed and a work done for man because he is man, not because he is fallen. But if Hilary has somewhat erred in placing the Cross in the background, he is not in error in magnifying the scope of the reconciliation[fn-6-P647_430155:452-nf] which includes it as in a wider horizon. Man has in Christ the nature of God; the infinite Mind is intelligible to the finite. The Creeds are no dry statement of facts which do not touch our life; the truths they contain are the revelation of God's self to us. Not for the pleasure of weaving theories, but in the interests of practical piety, Hilary has fused belief and conduct into the unity of that knowledge which Isaiah foresaw and St. John possessed; the knowledge which is not a means towards life, but life itself.

The latter state was inferior to that of the members of Christ (Orat. ii. 67, 68), while the immense (c. Gent. 8,de Incar. 5) consequences of its forfeiture came about only by a gradual course of deterioration (de Incar. 6. 1, hfanizeto; observe the tense), and in different degrees in different cases. The only difference of kind between the two conditions is in the universal reign of Death since the (partial) forfeiture of the kat eikona xarij: and even this difference is a subtle one; for man's existence in Paradise was not one of afqarsia except prospectively (de Incar. 3. 4). He enjoyed present happiness, alupoj anwdunj amerimnoj zwh, with promise of afqarsia in heaven. That is, death would have taken place, but not death as unredeemed mankind know it (cf. de Incar. 21. 1). In other words, man was created not so much in a state of perfection (teleioj ktisqeij,p. 384) as with a capacity for perfection (and for even more than perfection, p. 385 sq.) and with a destiny to correspond with such capacity. This destination remains in force even after man has failed to correspond to it, and is in fact assigned by Athanasius as the reason why the Incarnation was a necessity on God's part (de Incar. 6. 4-7, 10. 3, 13. 2-4, Orat. ii. 66, &c., &c.). Accordingly, while man was created (Orat. ii. 59) through the Word, the Word became Flesh that man might receive the yet higher dignity of Sonship[fn-5-P580_422233:92-nf] ; and while even before the Incarnation some men were de facto pure from sin (Orat. iii. 33) by virtue of the xarij thj klhsewj involved in  9to kat eikona' (see ib. 10, fin.; Orat. i. 39 is even stronger, cf. iv. 22), they were yet qnhtoi and fqartoi; whereas those in Christ die, no longer kata thn proteran genesin en tw 'Adam, but to live again logwqeishj thj sarkoj (Orat. iii. 33,fin., cf. de Incar. 21. 1).","title":"Prolegomena","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6. Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of sin is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-8-P842_326043:26-nf] Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,[fn-8-P843_326128:27-nf] yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: \"Put off the old man, and put on the new;\" which he goes on to explain by saying, \"Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.\"[fn-8-P844_326394:28-nf] But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaketh the truth from his heart may inhabit the holy hill of God?[fn-8-P845_326541:29-nf] But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the mystery of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the woman, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P846_326775:30-nf] with which mystery the apostle's words agree, where he says, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; set your thoughts[fn-8-P847_326988:31-nf] on things above.\"[fn-8-P848_327019:32-nf] For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the Father, means not to have thoughts[fn-8-P849_327135:33-nf] of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Some one accordingly asked them whether the Word of God could be changed, as the devil has been? and they feared not to say, `Yes, he could; for being begotten, he is susceptible of change' We then, with the bishops of Egypt and Libya, being assembled together to the number of nearly a hundred, have anathematized Arius for his shameless avowal of these heresies, together with all such as have countenanced them. Yet the partisans of Eusebius have received them; endeavoring to blend falsehood with truth, and that which is impious with what is sacred. But they shall not prevail, for the truth must triumph; and `light has no fellowship with darkness, nor has Christ any concord with Belial.'[fn-2-P217_57819:16-nf] Who ever heard such blasphemies? or what man of any piety is there now hearing them that is not horror-struck, and stops his ears, lest the filth of these expressions should pollute his sense of hearing? Who that hears John saying, `In the beginning was the Word,'[fn-2-P218_58104:17-nf] does not condemn those that say, `There was a period when the Word was not'? or who, hearing in the Gospel of `the only-begotten Son,' and that `all things were made by him,' will not abhor those that pronounce the Son to be one of the things made? How can he be one of the things which were made by himself? Or how can he be the only-begotten, if he is reckoned among created things? And how could he have had his existence from nonentities, since the Father has said, `My heart has indited a good matter';[fn-2-P219_58643:18-nf] and `I begat thee out of my bosom before the dawn'?[fn-2-P220_58735:19-nf] Or how is he unlike the Father's essence, who is `his perfect image,'[fn-2-P221_58901:20-nf] and `the brightness of his glory'[fn-2-P222_58952:21-nf] and says: `He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father'? Again how if the Son is the Word and Wisdom of God, was there a period when he did not exist? for that is equivalent to their saying that God was once destitute both of Word and Wisdom. How can he be mutable and susceptible of change, who says of himself, `I am in the Father, and the Father in me';[fn-2-P223_59324:22-nf] and `I and the Father are one';[fn-2-P224_59375:23-nf] and again by the Prophet,[fn-2-P225_59418:24-nf] `Behold me because I am, and have not changed'? But if any one may also apply the expression to the Father himself, yet would it now be even more fifty said of the Word; because he was not changed by having become man, but as the Apostle says,[fn-2-P226_59680:25-nf] `Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever' But what could persuade them to say that he was made on our account, when Paul has expressly declared[fn-2-P227_59857:26-nf] that `all things are for him, and by him'? One need not wonder indeed at their blasphemous assertion that the Son does not perfectly know the Father; for having once determined to fight against Christ, they reject even the words of the Lord himself, when he says,[fn-2-P228_60139:27-nf] `As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father' If therefore the Father but partially knows the Son, it is manifest that the Son also knows the Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it be admitted that the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is evident that as the Father knows his own Word, so also does the Word know his own Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and unfolding the divine Scriptures, have often confuted them: but again as chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that which is written, `When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity, he becomes contemptuous.'[fn-2-P229_60817:28-nf] Many heresies have arisen before these, which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete infatuation: but these persons, by attempting in all their discourses to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as hating made a nearer approach to Antichrist, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones. Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the Church, and anathematized. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of these persons, and especially so because, after having been previously instructed in the doctrines of the Church, they have now apostatized from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-2-P230_61534:29-nf] fell in like manner; and before them Judas, who had been a follower of the Saviour, but afterwards deserted him became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these very persons: for the Lord himself said: `Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall many deceive many';[fn-2-P231_61911:30-nf] and `the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore after them.'[fn-2-P232_61990:31-nf] And Paul, having learned these things from the Saviour, wrote, `That in the latter times some should apostatize from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'[fn-2-P233_62196:32-nf] who pervert the truth. Seeing then that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard their impiety have in consequence anathematized them, as we before said, and declared them to be alienated from the Catholic Church and faith. Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most honored fellow-ministers, in order the ye might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither does it become us even `to saute such men,'[fn-2-P234_63088:33-nf] as the blessed John has prohibited, `lest we should at any time be made partakers of their sins.'

Hence, if you have sense to abide by what logically follows, you will find the Son being eternally taught, nor yet ever able to reach the end of perfection, inasmuch as the wisdom of the Father is infinite, and the end of the infinite is beyond apprehension. It results that whoever refuses to grant that the Son has all things from the beginning will never grant that He will reach perfection.

For both being skilled in polite learning, the father as a grammarian, and the son as a rhetorician, they made themselves serviceable to the Christians at this crisis. For the former, as a grammarian, composed a grammar consistent with the Christian faith: he also translated the Books of Moses into heroic verse; and paraphrased all the historical books of the Old Testament, putting them partly into dactylic measure, and partly reducing them to the form of dramatic tragedy. He purposely employed all kinds of verse, that no form of expression peculiar to the Greek language might be unknown or unheard of amongst Christians. The younger Apollinaris, who was well trained in eloquence, expounded the gospels and apostolic doctrines in the way of dialogue, as Plato among the Greeks had done. Thus showing themselves useful to the Christian cause they overcame the subtlety of the emperor through their own labors. But Divine Providence was more potent than either their labors, or the craft of the emperor: for not long afterwards, in the manner we shall hereafter explain,[fn-11-P1136_499071:67-nf] the law became wholly inoperative; and the works of these men are now of no greater importance, than if they had never been written. But perhaps some one will vigorously reply saying: `On what grounds do you affirm that both these things were effected by the providence of God? That, the emperor's sudden death was very advantageous to Christianity is indeed evident: but surely the rejection of the Christian compositions of the two Apollinares, and the Christians beginning afresh to imbue their minds with the philosophy of the heathens, this works out no benefit to Christianity, for pagan philosophy teaches Polytheism, and is injurious to the promotion of true religion.' This objection I shall meet with such considerations as at present occur to me. Greek literature certainly was never recognized either by Christ or his Apostles as divinely inspired, nor on the other hand was it wholly rejected as pernicious. And this they did, I conceive, not inconsiderately. For there were many philosophers among the Greeks who were not far from the knowledge of God; and in fact these being disciplined by logical science, strenuously opposed the Epicureans and other contentious Sophists who denied Divine Providence, confuting their ignorance. And for these reasons they have become useful to all lovers of real piety: nevertheless they themselves were not acquainted with the Head of true religion, being ignorant of the mystery of Christ which `had been hidden from generations and ages.'[fn-11-P1137_500579:68-nf] And that this was so, the Apostle in his epistle to the Romans thus declares:[fn-11-P1138_500674:69-nf] `For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has shown it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, that they may be without excuse; because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.' From these words it appears that they had the knowledge of truth, which God had manifested to them; but were guilty on this account, that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God. Wherefore by not forbidding the study of the learned works of the Greeks, they left it to the discretion of those who wished to do so. This is our first argument in defense of the position we took: another may be thus put: The divinely inspired Scriptures undoubtedly inculcate doctrines that are both admirable in themselves, and heavenly in their character: they also eminently tend to produce piety and integrity of life in those who are guided by their precepts, pointing out a walk of faith which is highly approved of God. But they do not instruct us in the art of reasoning, by means of which we may be enabled successfully to resist those who oppose the truth. Besides adversaries are most easily foiled, when we can use · their own weapons against them. But this power was not supplied to Christians by the writings of the Apollinares. Julian had this in mind when he by law prohibited Christians from being educated in Greek literature, for he knew very well that the fables it contains would expose the whole pagan system, of which he had become the champion to ridicule and contempt. Even Socrates, the most celebrated of their philosophers, despised these absurdities, and was condemned on account of it, as if he had attempted to violate the sanctity of their deities. Moreover, both Christ and his Apostle enjoin us `to become discriminating money-changers,'[fn-11-P1139_502747:70-nf] so that we might `prove all things, and hold fast that which is good':[fn-11-P1140_502909:71-nf] directing us also to `beware lest any one should spoil us through philosophy and vain deceit.'[fn-11-P1141_503025:72-nf] But this we cannot do, unless we possess ourselves of the weapons of our adversaries: taking care that in making this acquisition we do not adopt their sentiments, but testing them, reject the evil, but retain all that is good and true: for good wherever it is found, is a property of truth. Should any one imagine that in making these assertions we wrest the Scriptures from their legitimate construction, let it be remembered that the Apostle not only does not forbid our being instructed in Greek learning, but that he himself seems by no means to have neglected it, inasmuch as he knows many of the sayings of the Greeks. Whence did he get the saying, `The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow-bellies,'[fn-11-P1142_503758:73-nf] but from a perusal of The Oracles of Epimenides,[fn-11-P1143_503824:74-nf] the Cretan Initiator? Or how would he have known this, `For we are also his offspring,'[fn-11-P1144_504341:75-nf] had he not been acquainted with The Phenomena of Aratus[fn-11-P1145_504417:76-nf] the astronomer? Again this sentence, `Evil communications corrupt good manners,'[fn-11-P1146_504543:77-nf] is a sufficient proof that he was conversant with the tragedies of Euripides.[fn-11-P1147_504641:78-nf] But what need is there of enlarging on this point? It is well known that in ancient times the doctors of the church by unhindered usage were accustomed to exercise themselves in the learning of the Greeks, until they had reached an advanced age: this they did with a view to improve themselves in eloquence and to strengthen and polish their mind, and at the same time to enable them to refute the errors of the heathen. Let these remarks be sufficient in the subject suggested by the two Apollinares.","title":"Book III.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_13_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"16.

On this account, then,when anything concerning wisdom is declared or narrated in the Scriptures, whether as itself speaking, or where anything is spoken of it, the Son chiefly is intimated to us. And by the example of Him who is the image, let us also not depart from Gods since we also are the Image of God: not indeed that which is equal to Him, since we are made so by the Father through the Son, and not born of the Father, as that is. And we are so, because we are enlightened with light; but that is so, because it is the light that enlightens; and which, therefore, being without pattern, is to us a pattern. For He does not imitate any one going before Him, in respect to the Father, from whom He is never separable at all, since He is the very same substance with Him from whom He is. But we by striving imitate Him who abides, and follow Him who stands still, and walking in Him, reach out towards Him; because He is made for us a way in time by His humiliation, which is to us an eternal abiding-place by His divinity. For since to pure intellectual spirits, who have not fallen through pride, He gives an example in the form of God and as equal with God and as God; so, in order that He might also give Himself as an example of returning to fallen man who on account of the uncleanness of sins and the punishment of mortality cannot see God, \"He emptied Himself;\" not by changing His own divinity, but by assuming our changeableness: and \"taking upon Him the form of a servant\"[fn-11-P1191_504612:12-nf] He came to us into this world,\"[fn-11-P1192_504662:13-nf] who \"was in this world,\" because \"the world was made by Him;\"[fn-11-P1193_504743:14-nf] that He might be an example upwards to those who see God, an example downwards to those who admire man, an example to the sound to persevere, an example to the sick to be made whole, an example to those who are to die that they may not fear, an example to the dead that they may rise again, \"that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.\"[fn-11-P1194_505104:15-nf] So that, because man ought not to follow any except God to blessedness, and yet cannot perceive God; by following God made man, he might follow at once Him whom he could perceive, and whom he ought to follow. Let us then love Him and cleave to Him, by charity spread abroad in our hearts, through the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.[fn-11-P1195_505458:16-nf] It is not therefore to be wondered at, if, on account of the example which the Image, which is equal to the Father, gives to us, in order that we may be refashioned after the image of God, Scripture, when it speaks of wisdom, speaks of the Son, whom we follow by living wisely; although the Father also is wisdom, as He is both light and God.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":720,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_09_book_iv_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Since I have referred to the monasteries of Egypt, it may be proper here to give a brief account of them. They were founded probably at a very early period, but were greatly enlarged and augmented by a devout man whose name was Ammoun. In his youth this person had an aversion to matrimony; but when some of his relatives urged him not to contemn marriage, but to take a wife to himself, he was prevailed upon and was married. On leading the bride with the customary ceremonies from the banquet-room to the nuptial couch, after their mutual friends had withdrawn, he took a book[fn-13-P1390_599387:50-nf] containing the epistles of the apostles and read to his wife Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, explaining to her the apostle's admonitions to married persons.[fn-13-P1391_599873:51-nf] Adducing many external considerations besides, he descanted on the inconveniences and discomforts attending matrimonial intercourse, the pangs of child-bearing, and the trouble and anxiety connected with rearing a family. He contrasted with all this the advantages of chastity; described the liberty, and immaculate purity of a life of continence; and affirmed that virginity places persons in the nearest relation to the Deity. By these and other arguments of a similar kind, he persuaded his virgin bride to renounce with him a secular life, prior to their having any conjugal knowledge of each other. Having taken this resolution, they retired together to the mountain of Nitria, and in a hut there inhabited for a short time one common ascetic apartment, without regarding their difference of sex, being according to the apostles, `one in Christ.'[fn-13-P1392_600750:52-nf] But not long after, the recent and unpolluted bride thus addressed Ammoun: `It is unsuitable,' said she, `for you who practice chastity, to look upon a woman in so confined a dwelling; let us therefore, if it is agreeable to you, perform our exercise apart.' This agreement again was satisfactory to both, and so they separated, and spent the rest of their lives in abstinence from wine and oil, eating dry bread alone, sometimes passing over one day, at others fasting two, and sometimes more. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, asserts in his Life of Anthony,[fn-13-P1393_601461:53-nf] that the subject of his memoir who was contemporary with this Ammoun, saw his soul taken up by angels after his decease. Accordingly, a great number of persons emulated Ammoun's manner of life, so that by degrees the mountains of Nitria and Scitis were filled with monks, an account of whose lives would require an express work. As, however, there were among them persons of eminent piety, distinguished for their strict discipline and apostolic lives, who said and did many things worthy of being recorded, I deem it useful to interweave with my history a few particulars selected out of the great number for the information of my readers. It is said that Ammoun never saw himself naked, being accustomed to say that `it became not a monk to see even his own person exposed.' And when once he wanted to pass a river, but was unwilling to undress, he besought God to enable him to cross without his being obliged to break his resolution; and immediately an angel transported him to the other side of the river. Another monk named Didymus[fn-13-P1394_602529:54-nf] lived entirely alone to the day of his death, although he had reached the age of ninety years. Arsenius, another of them, would not separate young delinquents from communion, but only those that were advanced in age: `for,' said he, `when a young person is excommunicated he becomes hardened; but an elderly one is soon sensible of the misery of excommunication.' Pior was accustomed to take his food as he walked along. As a certain one asked him, `Why do you eat thus?' `That I may not seem,' said he, `to make eating serious business but rather a thing done by the way.' To another putting the same question he replied, `Lest even in eating my mind should be sensible of corporeal enjoyment.' Isidore affirmed that he had not been conscious of sin even in thought for forty years; and that he had never consented either to lust or anger. Pambos being an illiterate man went to some one for the purpose of being taught a psalm; and having heard the first verse of the thirty-eighth psalm, `I said I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my tongue,'[fn-13-P1395_603612:55-nf] he departed without staying to hear the second verse, saying, `this one will suffice, if I can practically acquire it.' And when the person who had given him the verse reproved him because he had not seen him for the space of six months, he answered that he had not yet learnt to practice the verse of the psalm. After a considerable lapse of time, being asked by one of his friends whether he had made himself master of the verse, his answer was, `I have scarcely succeeded in accomplishing it during nineteen years.' A certain individual having placed gold in his hands for distribution to the poor, requested him to reckon what he had given him. `There is no need of counting,' said he, `but of integrity of mind.' This same Pambos, at the desire of Athanasius the bishop, came out of the desert to Alexandria and on beholding an actress there, he wept. When those present asked him why he wept, he replied, `Two causes have affected me: one is the destruction of this woman; the other is that I exert myself less to please my God than she does to please obscene characters.' Another said that `a monk who did not work ought to be regarded as on a level with the covetous man.' Piterus was well-informed in many branches of natural philosophy, and was accustomed frequently to enter into expositions of the principles sometimes of one and sometimes of another department of science, but he always commenced his expositions with prayer. There were also among the monks of that period, two of the same name, of great sanctity, each being called Macarius; one of whom was from Upper Egypt, the other from the city of Alexandria. Both were celebrated for their ascetic discipline, the purity of their life and conversation, and the miracles which were wrought by their hands. The Egyptian Macarius performed so many cures, and cast out so many devils, that it would require a distinct treatise to record all that the grace of God enabled him to do. His manner toward those who resorted to him was austere, yet at the same time calculated to inspire veneration. The Alexandrian Macarius, while in all respects resembling his Egyptian namesake, differed from him in this, that he was always cheerful to his visitors; and by the affability of his manners led many young men to asceticism. Evagrius[fn-13-P1396_605933:56-nf] became a disciple of these men, acquired from them the philosophy of deeds, whereas he had previously known that which consisted in words only. He was ordained deacon at Constantinople by Gregory of Nazianzus, and afterwards went with him into Egypt, where he became acquainted with these eminent persons, and emulated their course of conduct, and miracles were done by his hands as numerous and important as those of his preceptors. Books were also composed by him of very valuable nature, one of which is entitled The Monk, or, On Active Virtue; another The Gnostic,[fn-13-P1397_606654:57-nf] or, To him who is deemed worthy of Knowledge: this book is divided into fifty chapters. A third is designated Antirrheticus, and contains selections from the Holy Scriptures against tempting spirits, distributed into eight parts, according to the number of the arguments. He wrote moreover Six Hundred Prognostic Problems, and also two compositions in verse, one addressed To the Monks living in Communities, and the other To the Virgin. Whoever shall read these productions will be convinced of their excellence. It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to subjoin to what has been before stated, a few things mentioned by him respecting the monks. These are his words:[fn-13-P1398_607409:58-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":162,"source_code":"npnf2_14_npnf2_14_06_appended_note_on_the_eastern_editions_of_synodical_literature_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"(Prepared by Nicolas Glubokoffski, Professor of the Chair of the Holy Scriptures of the New Testament in the Ecclesiastical Academy of St. Petersburgh.)[fn-4-P442_71297:18-nf] ","title":"Appended Note on the Eastern Editions of Synodical Literature.","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_10_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"When the Temple of Serapis was torn down and laid bare, there were found in it, engraven on stones, certain characters which they call hieroglyphics, having the forms of crosses.[fn-16-P1650_710358:65-nf] Both the Christians and pagans on seeing them, appropriated and applied them to their respective religions: for the Christians who affirm that the cross is the sign of Christ's saving passion, claimed this character as peculiarly theirs; but the pagans alleged that it might appertain to Christ and Serapis in common; `for,' said they, `it symbolizes one thing to Christians and another to heathens.'

They were created in Him[fn-10-P1066_656741:34-nf] , for He was born as God the Creator. Again, nothing that was made in Him was made without Him, for the reason that God the Begotten was life, and was born as Life, not made life after His birth; for there are not two elements in Him, one inborn and one afterwards conferred. There is no interval in His case between birth and maturity. None of the things that were created in Him was made without Him, for He is the Life which made their creation possible. Moreover God, the Son of God, became God by virtue of His birth, not after He was born. Being born the Living from the Living, the True from the True, the Perfect from the Perfect, He was born in full possession of His powers. He needed not to learn in after time what His birth was, but was conscious of His Godhead by the very fact that He was born as God of God.

Three things are, indeed, needed to form a shadow, light, a body, a dark place. The shadow of heaven forms the darkness of the world. Understand, I pray you, what I mean, by a simple example; by raising for yourself at mid-day a tent of some compact and impenetrable material, and shutting yourself up in it in sudden darkness. Suppose that original darkness was like this, not subsisting directly by itself, but resulting from some external coasts. If it is said that it rested upon the deep, it is because the extremity of air naturally touches the surface of bodies; and as at that time the water covered everything, we are obliged to say that darkness was upon the face of the deep.","title":"Homily II.-\"The Earth Was Invisible and Unfinished.\"","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":508,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_10_homily_ii_the_earth_was_invisible_and_unfinished_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"6. And the Spirit of God was borne upon the face of the waters.[fn-20-P2089_608367:22-nf] Does this spirit mean the diffusion of air? The sacred writer wishes to enumerate to you the elements of the world, to tell you that God created the heavens, the earth, water, and air and that the last was now diffused and in motion; or rather, that which is truer and confirmed by the authority of the ancients, by the Spirit of God, he means the Holy Spirit. It is, as has been remarked, the special name, the name above all others that Scripture delights to give to the Holy Spirit. and always by the spirit of God the Holy Spirit is meant, the Spirit which completes the divine and blessed Trinity. You will find it better therefore to take it in this sense. How then did the Spirit of God move upon the waters? The explanation that I am about to give you is not an original one, but that of a Syrian,[fn-20-P2090_609198:23-nf] who was as ignorant in the wisdom of this world as he was versed in the knowledge of the Truth. He said, then, that the Syriac word was more expressive, and that being more analogous to the Hebrew term it was a nearer approach to the scriptural sense. This is the meaning of the word; by \"was borne\" the Syrians, he says, understand: it cherished[fn-20-P2091_609568:24-nf] the nature of the waters as one sees a bird cover the eggs with her body and impart to them vital force from her own warmth. Such is, as nearly as possible, the meaning of these words-the Spirit was borne: let us understand, that is, prepared the nature of water to produce living beings:[fn-20-P2092_609986:25-nf] a sufficient proof for those who ask if the Holy Spirit took an active part in the creation of the world.7. And God said, Let there be light.[fn-20-P2093_610962:26-nf] The first word of God created the nature of light; it made darkness vanish, dispelled gloom, illuminated the world, and gave to all beings at the same time a sweet and gracious aspect. The heavens, until then enveloped in darkness, appeared with that beauty which they still present to our eyes. The air was lighted up, or rather made the light circulatemixed with its substance, and, distributing itssplendour rapidly in every direction, so dispersed itself to its extreme limits. Up it sprang to the very aether and heaven. In an instant it lighted up the whole extent of the world, the North and the South, the East and the West. For the aether also is such a subtle substance and so transparent that it needs not the space of a moment for light to pass through it. Just as it carries our sight instantaneously to the object of vision,[fn-20-P2094_611876:27-nf] so without the least interval, with a rapidity I that thought cannot conceive, it receives these rays of light in its uttermost limits. With light the aether becomes more pleasing and the waters more limpid.

For we are not ashamed to confess that we have prepared for our contest no weapon of argument sharpened by rhetoric, that we can bring forward to aid us in the fight with those arrayed against us, no cleverness or sharpness of dialectic, such as with inexperienced judges lays even on truth the suspicion of falsehood. One strength our reasoning against falsehood has-first the very Word Himself, Who is the might of our word,[fn-13-P1313_704052:2-nf] and in the next place the rottenness of the arguments set against us, which is overthrown and falls by its own spontaneous action. Now in order that it may be made as clear as possible to all men, that the very efforts Of Eunomius serve as means for his own overthrow to those who contend with him, I will set forth to my readers his phantom doctrine (for so I think that doctrine may be called which is quite outside the truth), and I would have you all, who are present at our struggle, and watch the encounter now taking place between my doctrine and that which is matched with it, to be just judges of the lawful striving of our arguments, that by your just award the reasoning of godliness may be proclaimed as victor to the whole theatre of the Church, having won undisputed victory over ungodliness, and being decorated, in virtue of the three falls of its enemy, with the unfading crown of them that are saved. Now this statement is set forth against the truth by way of preface to his third discourse, and this is the fashion of it:-\"Preserving,\" he says, \"natural order, and abiding by those things which are known to us from above, we do not refuse to speak of the Son, seeing He is begotten, even by the name of `product of generation[fn-13-P1314_705372:3-nf] ,' since the generated essence and[fn-13-P1315_705419:4-nf] the appellation of Son make such a relation of words appropriate.\" I beg the reader to give his attention carefully to this point, that while he calls God both \"begotten\" and \"Son,\" he refers the reason of such names to \"natural order,\" and calls to witness to this conception the knowledge possessed from above: so that if anything should be found in the course of what follows contrary to the positions be has laid down, it is clear to all that he is overthrown by himself, refuted by his own arguments before ours are brought against him. And so let us consider his statement in the light of his own words. He confesses that the name of \"Son\" would by no means be properly applied to the Only-begotten God, did not \"natural order,\" as he says, confirm the appellation. If, then, one were to withdraw the order of nature from the consideration of the designation of \"Son,\" his use of this name, being deprived of its proper and natural significance, will be meaningless. And moreover the fact that he says these statements are confirmed, in that they abide by the knowledge possessed from above, is a strong additional support to the orthodox view touching the designation of \"Son,\" seeing that the inspired teaching of the Scriptures, which comes to us from above, confirms our argument on these matters. If these things are so, and this is a standard of truth that admits of no deception, that these two concur-the \"natural order,\" as he says, and the testimony of the knowledge given from above confirming the natural interpretation-it is clear, that to assert anything contrary to these, is nothing else than manifestly to fight against the truth itself. Let us hear again what this writer, who makes nature his instructor in the matter of this name, and says that he abides by the knowledge given to us from above by the instruction of the saints, sets out at length a little further on, after the passage I have just quoted. For I will pretermit for the time the continuous recital of what is set next in order in his treatise, that the contradiction in what he has written may not escape detection, being veiled by the reading of the intervening matter. \"The same argument,\" he says, \"will apply also in the case of what is made and created, as both the natural interpretation and the mutual relation of the things, and also the use of the saints, give us free authority for the use of the formula: wherefore one would not be wrong in treating the thing made as corresponding to the maker, and the thing created to the creator.\" Of what product of making or of creation does he speak, as having naturally the relation expressed in its name towards its maker and creator? If of those we contemplate in the creation, visible and invisible (as Paul recounts, when he says that by Him all things were created, visible and invisible)[fn-13-P1316_708420:5-nf] , so that this relative conjunction of names has a proper and special application, that which is made being set in relation to the maker, that which is created to the creator,-if this is his meaning, we agree with him. For in fact, since the Lord is the Maker of angels, the angel is assuredly a thing made by Him that made him: and since the Lord is the Creator of the world, clearly the world itself and all that is therein are called the creature of Him that created them. If however it is with this intention that he makes his interpretation of \"natural order,\" systematizing the appropriation of relative terms with a view to their mutual relation in verbal sense, even thus it would be an extraordinary thing, seeing that every one is aware of this, that he should leave his doctrinal statement to draw out for us a system of grammatical trivialities[fn-13-P1317_709296:6-nf] . But if it is to the Only-begotten God that he applies such phrases, so as to say that He is a thing made by Him that made Him, a creature of Him that created Him, and to refer this terminology to \"the use of the saints,\" let him first of all show us in his statement what saints he says there are who declared the Maker of all things to be a product and a creature, and whom he follows in this audacity of phrase. The Church knows as saints those whose hearts were divinely guided by the Holy Spirit,-patriarchs, lawgivers, prophets, evangelists, apostles. If any among these is found to declare in his inspired words that God over all, Who \"upholds all things with the word of His power,\" and grasps with His hand all things that are, and by Himself called the universe into being by the mere act of His will, is a thing created and a product, he will stand excused, as following, as he says, the \"use of the saints[fn-13-P1318_710274:7-nf] \" in proceeding to formulate such doctrines. But if the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures is freely placed within the reach of all, and nothing is forbidden to or hidden from any of those who choose to share in the divine instruction, how comes it that he endeavours to lead his hearers astray by his misrepresentation of the Scriptures, referring the term \"creature,\" applied to the Only-begotten, to \"the use of the saints\"? For that by Him all things were made, you may hear almost from the whole of their holy utterance, from Moses and the prophets and apostles who come after him, whose particular expressions it would be tedious here to set forth. Enough for our purpose, with the others, and above the others, is the sublime John, where in the preface to his discourse on the Divinity of the Only-begotten he proclaims aloud the fact that there is none of the things that were made which was not made through Him[fn-13-P1319_711386:8-nf] , a fact which is an incontestable and positive proof of His being Lord of the creation, not reckoned in the list of created things. For if all things that are made exist by no other but by Him (and John bears witness that nothing among the things that are, throughout the creation, was made without Him), who is so blinded in understanding as not to see in the Evangelist's proclamation the truth, that He Who made all the creation is assuredly something else besides the creation? For if all that is numbered among the things that were made has its being through Him, while He Himself is \"in the beginning,\" and is \"with God,\" being God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and express Image, and Brightness, and if none of the things that were made throughout creation is named by the same names-(not Word, not God, not Life, not Light, not Truthn not express Image, not Brightness, not any of the other names proper to the Deity is to be found employed of the creation)-then it is clear that He Who is these things is by nature something else besides the creation, which neither is nor is called any of these things. If, indeed, there existed in such phrases an identity of names between the creation and its Maker, he might perhaps be excused for making the name of \"creation\" also common to the thing created and to Him Who made it, on the ground of the community of the other names: but if the characteristics which are contemplated by means of the names, in the created and in the uncreated nature, are in no case reconcilable or common to both, how can the misrepresentation of that man fail to be manifest to all, who dares to apply the name of servitude to Him Who, as the Psalmist declares, \"ruleth with His power for ever[fn-13-P1320_713138:9-nf] ,\" and to bring Him Who, as the Apostle says, \"in all things hath the pre-eminence[fn-13-P1321_713245:10-nf] ,\" to a level with the servile nature, by means of the name and conception of \"creation\"? For that all[fn-13-P1322_713365:11-nf] the creation is in bondage the great Paul declares[fn-13-P1323_713472:12-nf] , - he who in the schools above the heavens was instructed in that knowledge which may not be spoken, learning these things in that place where every voice that conveys meaning by verbal utterance is still, and where unspoken meditation becomes the word of instruction, teaching to the purified heart by means of the silent illumination of the thoughts those truths which transcend speech. If then on the one hand Paul proclaims aloud \"the creation is in bondage,\" and on the other the Only-begotten God is truly Lord and God over all, and John bears witness to the fact that the whole creation of the things that were made is by Him, how can any one, who is in any sense whatever numbered among Christians, hold his peace when he sees Eunomius, by his inconsistent and inconsequent systematizing, degrading to the humble state of the creature, by means of an identity of name: that tends to servitude, that power of Lordship which surpasses all rule and all authority? And if he says that he has some of the saints who declared Him to be a slave, or created, or made, or any of these lowly and servile names, lo, here are the Scriptures. Let him, or some other on his behalf, produce to us one such phrase, and we will hold our peace. But if there is no such phrase (and there could never be found in those inspired Scriptures which we believe any such thought as to support this impiety), what need is there to strive further upon points admitted with one who not only misrepresents the words of the saints, but even contends against his own definitions? For if the \"order of nature,\" as he himself admits, bears additional testimony to the Son's name by reason of His being begotten, and thus the correspondence of the name is according to the relation of the Begotten to the Begetter, how comes it that he wrests the significance of the word \"Son\" from its natural application, and changes the relation to \"the thing made and its maker\"-a relation which applies not only in the case of the elements of the universe, but might also be asserted of a gnat or an ant-that in so far as each of these is a thing made, the relation of its name to its maker is similarly equivalent? The blasphemous nature of his doctrine is clear, not only from many other passages, but even from those quoted: and as for that \"use of the saints\" which he alleges that he follows in these expressions, it is clear that there is no such use at all.","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"If, when a man \"strives lawfully[fn-13-P1312_702598:1-nf] ,\" he finds a limit to his struggle in the contest by his adversary's either refusing the struggle, and withdrawing of his own accord in favour of his conqueror from his effort for victory, or being thrown according to the rules of wrestling in three falls (whereby the glory of the crown is bestowed with all the splendour of proclamation upon him who has proved victorious in the umpire's judgment), then, since Eunomius, though he has been already twice thrown in our previous arguments, does not consent that truth should hold the tokens of her victory over falsehood, but yet a third time raises the dust against godly doctrine in his accustomed arena of falsehood with his composition, strengthening himself for his struggle on the side of deceit, our statement of truth must also be now called forth to put his falsehood to rout, placing its hopes in Him Who is the Giver and the Judge of victory, and at the same time deriving strength from the very unfairness of the adversaries' tricks of wrestling. For we are not ashamed to confess that we have prepared for our contest no weapon of argument sharpened by rhetoric, that we can bring forward to aid us in the fight with those arrayed against us, no cleverness or sharpness of dialectic, such as with inexperienced judges lays even on truth the suspicion of falsehood. One strength our reasoning against falsehood has-first the very Word Himself, Who is the might of our word,[fn-13-P1313_704052:2-nf] and in the next place the rottenness of the arguments set against us, which is overthrown and falls by its own spontaneous action. Now in order that it may be made as clear as possible to all men, that the very efforts Of Eunomius serve as means for his own overthrow to those who contend with him, I will set forth to my readers his phantom doctrine (for so I think that doctrine may be called which is quite outside the truth), and I would have you all, who are present at our struggle, and watch the encounter now taking place between my doctrine and that which is matched with it, to be just judges of the lawful striving of our arguments, that by your just award the reasoning of godliness may be proclaimed as victor to the whole theatre of the Church, having won undisputed victory over ungodliness, and being decorated, in virtue of the three falls of its enemy, with the unfading crown of them that are saved. Now this statement is set forth against the truth by way of preface to his third discourse, and this is the fashion of it:-\"Preserving,\" he says, \"natural order, and abiding by those things which are known to us from above, we do not refuse to speak of the Son, seeing He is begotten, even by the name of `product of generation[fn-13-P1314_705372:3-nf] ,' since the generated essence and[fn-13-P1315_705419:4-nf] the appellation of Son make such a relation of words appropriate.\" I beg the reader to give his attention carefully to this point, that while he calls God both \"begotten\" and \"Son,\" he refers the reason of such names to \"natural order,\" and calls to witness to this conception the knowledge possessed from above: so that if anything should be found in the course of what follows contrary to the positions be has laid down, it is clear to all that he is overthrown by himself, refuted by his own arguments before ours are brought against him. And so let us consider his statement in the light of his own words. He confesses that the name of \"Son\" would by no means be properly applied to the Only-begotten God, did not \"natural order,\" as he says, confirm the appellation. If, then, one were to withdraw the order of nature from the consideration of the designation of \"Son,\" his use of this name, being deprived of its proper and natural significance, will be meaningless. And moreover the fact that he says these statements are confirmed, in that they abide by the knowledge possessed from above, is a strong additional support to the orthodox view touching the designation of \"Son,\" seeing that the inspired teaching of the Scriptures, which comes to us from above, confirms our argument on these matters. If these things are so, and this is a standard of truth that admits of no deception, that these two concur-the \"natural order,\" as he says, and the testimony of the knowledge given from above confirming the natural interpretation-it is clear, that to assert anything contrary to these, is nothing else than manifestly to fight against the truth itself. Let us hear again what this writer, who makes nature his instructor in the matter of this name, and says that he abides by the knowledge given to us from above by the instruction of the saints, sets out at length a little further on, after the passage I have just quoted. For I will pretermit for the time the continuous recital of what is set next in order in his treatise, that the contradiction in what he has written may not escape detection, being veiled by the reading of the intervening matter. \"The same argument,\" he says, \"will apply also in the case of what is made and created, as both the natural interpretation and the mutual relation of the things, and also the use of the saints, give us free authority for the use of the formula: wherefore one would not be wrong in treating the thing made as corresponding to the maker, and the thing created to the creator.\" Of what product of making or of creation does he speak, as having naturally the relation expressed in its name towards its maker and creator? If of those we contemplate in the creation, visible and invisible (as Paul recounts, when he says that by Him all things were created, visible and invisible)[fn-13-P1316_708420:5-nf] , so that this relative conjunction of names has a proper and special application, that which is made being set in relation to the maker, that which is created to the creator,-if this is his meaning, we agree with him. For in fact, since the Lord is the Maker of angels, the angel is assuredly a thing made by Him that made him: and since the Lord is the Creator of the world, clearly the world itself and all that is therein are called the creature of Him that created them. If however it is with this intention that he makes his interpretation of \"natural order,\" systematizing the appropriation of relative terms with a view to their mutual relation in verbal sense, even thus it would be an extraordinary thing, seeing that every one is aware of this, that he should leave his doctrinal statement to draw out for us a system of grammatical trivialities[fn-13-P1317_709296:6-nf] . But if it is to the Only-begotten God that he applies such phrases, so as to say that He is a thing made by Him that made Him, a creature of Him that created Him, and to refer this terminology to \"the use of the saints,\" let him first of all show us in his statement what saints he says there are who declared the Maker of all things to be a product and a creature, and whom he follows in this audacity of phrase. The Church knows as saints those whose hearts were divinely guided by the Holy Spirit,-patriarchs, lawgivers, prophets, evangelists, apostles. If any among these is found to declare in his inspired words that God over all, Who \"upholds all things with the word of His power,\" and grasps with His hand all things that are, and by Himself called the universe into being by the mere act of His will, is a thing created and a product, he will stand excused, as following, as he says, the \"use of the saints[fn-13-P1318_710274:7-nf] \" in proceeding to formulate such doctrines. But if the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures is freely placed within the reach of all, and nothing is forbidden to or hidden from any of those who choose to share in the divine instruction, how comes it that he endeavours to lead his hearers astray by his misrepresentation of the Scriptures, referring the term \"creature,\" applied to the Only-begotten, to \"the use of the saints\"? For that by Him all things were made, you may hear almost from the whole of their holy utterance, from Moses and the prophets and apostles who come after him, whose particular expressions it would be tedious here to set forth. Enough for our purpose, with the others, and above the others, is the sublime John, where in the preface to his discourse on the Divinity of the Only-begotten he proclaims aloud the fact that there is none of the things that were made which was not made through Him[fn-13-P1319_711386:8-nf] , a fact which is an incontestable and positive proof of His being Lord of the creation, not reckoned in the list of created things. For if all things that are made exist by no other but by Him (and John bears witness that nothing among the things that are, throughout the creation, was made without Him), who is so blinded in understanding as not to see in the Evangelist's proclamation the truth, that He Who made all the creation is assuredly something else besides the creation? For if all that is numbered among the things that were made has its being through Him, while He Himself is \"in the beginning,\" and is \"with God,\" being God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and express Image, and Brightness, and if none of the things that were made throughout creation is named by the same names-(not Word, not God, not Life, not Light, not Truthn not express Image, not Brightness, not any of the other names proper to the Deity is to be found employed of the creation)-then it is clear that He Who is these things is by nature something else besides the creation, which neither is nor is called any of these things. If, indeed, there existed in such phrases an identity of names between the creation and its Maker, he might perhaps be excused for making the name of \"creation\" also common to the thing created and to Him Who made it, on the ground of the community of the other names: but if the characteristics which are contemplated by means of the names, in the created and in the uncreated nature, are in no case reconcilable or common to both, how can the misrepresentation of that man fail to be manifest to all, who dares to apply the name of servitude to Him Who, as the Psalmist declares, \"ruleth with His power for ever[fn-13-P1320_713138:9-nf] ,\" and to bring Him Who, as the Apostle says, \"in all things hath the pre-eminence[fn-13-P1321_713245:10-nf] ,\" to a level with the servile nature, by means of the name and conception of \"creation\"? For that all[fn-13-P1322_713365:11-nf] the creation is in bondage the great Paul declares[fn-13-P1323_713472:12-nf] , - he who in the schools above the heavens was instructed in that knowledge which may not be spoken, learning these things in that place where every voice that conveys meaning by verbal utterance is still, and where unspoken meditation becomes the word of instruction, teaching to the purified heart by means of the silent illumination of the thoughts those truths which transcend speech. If then on the one hand Paul proclaims aloud \"the creation is in bondage,\" and on the other the Only-begotten God is truly Lord and God over all, and John bears witness to the fact that the whole creation of the things that were made is by Him, how can any one, who is in any sense whatever numbered among Christians, hold his peace when he sees Eunomius, by his inconsistent and inconsequent systematizing, degrading to the humble state of the creature, by means of an identity of name: that tends to servitude, that power of Lordship which surpasses all rule and all authority? And if he says that he has some of the saints who declared Him to be a slave, or created, or made, or any of these lowly and servile names, lo, here are the Scriptures. Let him, or some other on his behalf, produce to us one such phrase, and we will hold our peace. But if there is no such phrase (and there could never be found in those inspired Scriptures which we believe any such thought as to support this impiety), what need is there to strive further upon points admitted with one who not only misrepresents the words of the saints, but even contends against his own definitions?

Wherefore, if Holy Scripture proclaims that God is love, and that love is of God, and works this in us that we abide in God and He in us, and that hereby we know this, because He has given us of His Spirit, then the Spirit Himself is God, who is love. Next, if there [be among the gifts of God none greater than love, and there is no greater gift of God than the Holy Spirit, what follows more naturally than that He is Himself love, who is called both God and of God? And if the love by which the Father loves the Son, and the Son loves the Father, ineffably demonstrates the communion of both, what is more suitable than that He should be specially called love, who is the Spirit common to both? For this is the sounder thing both to believe and to understand, that the Holy Spirit is not alone love in that Trinity, yet is not specially called love to no purpose, for the reasons we have alleged; just as He is not alone in that Trinity either a Spirit or holy, since both the Father is a Spirit, and the Son is a Spirit; and both the Father is holy, and the Son is holy,-as piety doubts not. And yet it is not to no purpose that He is specially called the Holy Spirit; for because He is common to both, He is specially called that which both are in common. Otherwise, if in that Trinity the Holy Spirit alone is love, then doubtless the Son too turns out to be the Son, not of the Father only, but also of the Holy Spirit. For He is both said and read in countless places to be so,-the only-begotten Son of God the Father; as that what the apostle says of God the Father is true too: \"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness .and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His own love.\"[fn-20-P2077_1051608:100-nf] He did not say, \"of His own Son.\" If He had so said, He would have said it most truly, just as He did say it most truly, because He has often said it; but He says, \"the Son of His own love.\" Therefore He is the Son also of the Holy Spirit, if there is in that Trinity no love in God except the Holy Spirit. And if this is most absurd, it remains that the Holy Spirit is not alone therein love, but is specially so called for the reasons I have sufficiently set forth; and that the words, \"Son of His own love,\" mean nothing else than His own beloved Son,-the Son, in short, of His own substance. For the love in the Father, which is in His ineffably simple nature, is nothing else than His very nature and substance itself,-as we have already often said, and are not ashamed of often repeating. And hence the \"Son of His love,\" is none other than He who is born of His substance.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_15_book_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"48.

For a likeness must needs repeat the form of that of which it is the likeness. Let those, however, who will have a nature of a different sort in the Son determine what sort of likeness of the invisible God they wish the Son to be. Is it a bodily likeness exposed to the gaze, and moving from place to place with human gait and motion? Nay, but let them remember that according to the Gospels and the Prophets both Christ is a Spirit and God is a Spirit. If they confine this Christ the Spirit within the bounds of shape and body, such a corporeal Christ will not be the likeness of the invisible God, nor will a finite limitation represent that which is infinite.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_15_book_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"49.

But, before we investigate the meaning and occasion of these words, let us first appear to the judgment of common sense. Is it credible, that He, Who stands to all things as the Author of their present and future, should not know all things? If all things are through and in Christ, and in such a way through Christ that they are also in Him, must not that, which is both in Him and through Him, be also in His knowledge, when that knowledge, by virtue of a nature which cannot be nescient, habitually apprehends what is neither in, nor through Him[fn-18-P1896_1247287:104-nf] ? But that which derives from Him alone its origin, and has in Him alone the efficient cause of its present state and future development, can that be beyond the ken of His nature, through which is effected, and in which is contained, all that it is and shall be? Jesus Christ knows the thoughts of the mind, as it is now, stirred by present motives, and as it will be to-morrow, aroused by the impulse of future desires. Hear the witness of the Evangelist, For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray Him[fn-18-P1897_1247910:105-nf] . By its virtue His nature could perceive the unborn future, and foresee the awakening of passions yet dormant in the mind: do you believe that it did not know what is through itself, and within itself? He is Lord of all that belongs to others, is He not Lord of His own?

Human natures, so far as in them lies, foresee what they determine to do: knowledge of the end desired accompanies the desire to act: does not He Who is born God, know what is in, and through, Himself? The times are through Him, the day is in His hand, for the future is constituted through Him, and the Dispensation of His coming is in His power: is His understanding so dull, that the sense of His torpid nature does not tell Him what He has Himself determined?

Isaiah laments, saying,[fn-78-P7875_2549509:69-nf] \"Woe is me! for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips\"; and afterwards one of the seraphim brings a hot coal, taken with the tongs, to purify the prophet's lips, for he was not, according to the tenor of your words, arrogant, but he confessed his own faults.

And thus we are made to understand that the intelligent creation, which constitutes the free Jerusalem,[fn-24-P2456_1187752:99-nf] ought to be subordinate in the order of speech to the Creator, the Supreme Trinity: for all that is said of the man Christ Jesus has reference, of course, to the unity of the person of the Only-begotten. Therefore the true order of the Creed demanded that the Church should be made subordinate to the Trinity, as the house to Him who dwells in it, the temple to God who occupies it, and the city to its builder. And we are here to understand the whole Church, not that part of it only which wanders as a stranger on the earth, praising the name of God from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, and singing a new song of deliverance from its old captivity; but that part also which has always from its creation remained steadfast to God in heaven, and has never experienced the misery consequent upon a fall. This part is made up of the holy angels, who enjoy uninterrupted happiness; and (as it is bound to do) it renders assistance to the part which is still wandering among strangers: for these two parts shall be one in the fellowship of eternity, and now they are one in the bonds of love, the whole having been ordained for the worship of the one God. Wherefore, neither the whole Church, nor any part of it, has any desire to be worshipped instead of God, nor to be God to any one who belongs to the temple of God-that temple which is built up of the saints who were created by the uncreated God. And therefore the Holy Spirit, if a creature, could not be the Creator, but would be a part of the intelligent creation. He would simply be the highest creature, and therefore would not be mentioned in the Creed before the Church; for He Himself would belong to the Church. to that part of it which is in the heavens.

For who knows not that the multitude of human souls is countless, yet one essence underlies them all, and the consubstantial substratum in them is alien from bodily corruption? so that even children can plainly see the argument that bodies are corrupted and dissolved, not because they have the same essence one with another, but because of their possessing a compound nature. The idea of the compound nature is one, that of the common nature of their essence is another, so that it is true to say, \"corruptible bodies are of one essence,\" but the converse statement is not true at all, if it be anything like, \"this consubstantial nature is also surely corruptible,\" as is shown in the case of the souls which have one essence, while yet corruption does not attach to them in virtue of the community of essence. And the account given of the souls might properly be applied to every intellectual existence which we contemplate in creation. For the words brought together by Paul do not signify, as Eunomius will havethem do, some mutually divergent natures of the supra-mundane powers; on the contrary, the sense of the names clearly indicates that he is mentioning in his argument, not diversities of natures, but the varied peculiarities of the operations of the heavenly host: for there are, he says, \"principalities,\" and \"thrones,\" and \"powers,\" and \"mights,\" and \"dominions[fn-18-P1806_1054445:38-nf] .\" Now these names are such as to make it at once clear to every one that their significance is arranged in regard to some operation. For to rule, and to exercise power and dominion, and to be the throne of some one,-all these conceptions would not be held by any one versed in argument to apply to diversities of essence, since it is clearly operation that is signified by every one of the names: so that any one who says that diversities of nature are signified by the names rehearsed by Paul deceives himself, \"understanding,\" as the Apostle says, \"neither what he says, nor whereof he affirms[fn-18-P1807_1055079:39-nf] ,\" since the sense of the names clearly shows that the Apostle recognizes in the intelligible powers distinctions of certain ranks, but does not by these names indicate varieties of essences.

A regenerate man does not regenerate, but generates, sons according to the flesh; and thus he transmits to his posterity, not the condition of the regenerated, but only of the generated. Therefore, be a man guilty of unbelief, or a perfect believer, he does not in either case beget faithful children, but sinners; in the same way that the seeds, not only of a wild olive, but also of a cultivated one, produce not cultivated olives, but wild ones. So, likewise, his first birth holds a man in that bondage from which nothing but his second birth delivers him. The devil holds him, Christ liberates him: Eve's deceiver holds him, Mary's Son frees him: he holds him, who approached the man through the woman; He frees him, who was born of a woman that never approached a man: he holds him, who injected into the woman the cause of lust; He liberates him, who without any lust was conceived in the woman.

For, to say nothing of the fact that they are baptized for the remission of sins by no fallacious, but by a true and faithful mystery, there is previously wrought on them the exorcism and the exsufflation of the hostile power, which they profess to renounce by the mouth of those who bring them to baptism.

But the Word was God, and with God in the beginning, and therefore the anointing could neither be related nor explained, if it referred to that nature, of which we are told nothing, except that it was in the beginning. And in fact He Who was God had no need to anoint Himself with the Spirit and power of God, when He was Himself the Spirit and power of God. So He, being God, was anointed by His God above His fellows. And, although there were many Christs (i.e. anointed persons) according to the Law before the Dispensation of the flesh, yet Christ, Who was anointed above His fellows, came after them, for He was preferred above His anointed fellows. Accordingly, the words of the prophecy bring out the fact that the anointing took place in time, and comparatively late in time. Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity: therefore Thy God, O God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. Now, a fact which follows later upon other facts, cannot be dated before them. That a reward be deserved postulates as a prior condition the existence of one who can deserve it, for merit earned implies that there has been one capable of acquiring it. If, therefore, we attribute the birth of the Only-begotten God to this anointing, which is His reward for loving righteousness and hating iniquity, we shall be regarding Him not as born, but as promoted by unction, to be the Only-begotten God. But then we imply that He advanced with gradual progress and promotion to perfect divinity, and that He was not born God, but afterwards for His merit anointed God. Thus we shall make Christ as God Himself conditioned, whereas He is the final cause of all conditions; and what becomes then of the Apostle's words, All things are through Him and in Him, and He is before all, and in Him all things consist[fn-22-P2213_1418690:33-nf] ? The Lord Jesus Christ was not deified because of anything, or by means of anything, but was born God: God by origin, not promoted to divinity for any cause after His birth, but as the Son; and one in kind with God because begotten of Him. His anointing then, though it is the result of a cause, did not enhance that in Him, which could not be made more perfect. It concerned that part of Him which was to be made perfect through the perfection of the Mystery: that is, our manhood was sanctified in Christ by unction. If then the prophet here also teaches us the dispensation of the servant, for which Christ is anointed by His God above His fellows, and that because He loved righteousness and hated iniquity, then surely the words of the prophet must refer to that nature in Christ, by which He has fellows through His assumption of flesh. Can we doubt this when we note how carefully the Spirit of prophecy chooses His words? God is anointed by His God; that is, in His own nature He is God, but in the dispensation of the anointing God is His God. God is anointed: but tell me, is that Word anointed, Who was God in the beginning? Manifestly not, for the anointing comes after His divine birth. It was then not the begotten Word, God with God in the beginning, Who was anointed, but that nature in God which came to Him through the dispensation later than His divinity[fn-22-P2214_1420086:34-nf] : and when His God anointed Him, He anointed in Him the whole nature of the servant, which He assumed in the mystery of His flesh.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_25_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6.

And, in truth, for no other reason were all those things which we read in the Holy Scriptures written, previous to the Lord's advent, but for this,-namely, that His advent might be pressed upon the attention, and that the Church which was to be, should be intimated beforehand, that is to say, the people of God throughout all nations; which Church is His body, wherewith also are united and numbered all the saints who lived in this world, even before His advent, and who believed then in His future coming, just as we believe in His past coming. For (to use an illustration) Jacob, at the time when he was being born, first put forth from the womb a hand, with which also he held the foot of the brother who was taking priority of him in the act of birth; and next indeed the head followed, and thereafter, at last, and as matter of course, the rest of the members:[fn-28-P2842_1307354:17-nf] while, nevertheless the head in point of dignity and power has precedence, not only of those members which followed it then, but also of the very hand which anticipated it in the process of the birth, and is really the first, although not in the matter of the time of appearing, at least in the order of nature. And in an analogous manner, the Lord Jesus Christ, previous to His appearing in the fiesta, and coming forth in a certain manner out of the womb of His secrecy, before the eyes of men as Man, the Mediator between God and men,[fn-28-P2843_1307912:18-nf] \"who is over all, God blessed for ever,\"[fn-28-P2844_1307972:19-nf] sent before Him, in the person of the holy patriarchs and prophets, a certain portion of His body, wherewith, as by a hand, He gave token beforetime of His own approaching birth, and also supplanted[fn-28-P2845_1308188:20-nf] the people who were prior to Him in their pride, using for that purpose the bonds of the law, as if they were His five fingers. For through five epochs of times[fn-28-P2846_1308445:21-nf] there was no cessation in the foretelling and prophesying of His own destined coming; and in a manner consonant with this, he through whom the law was given wrote five books; and proud men, who were carnally minded, and sought to \"establish their own righteousness,\"[fn-28-P2847_1308737:22-nf] were not filled with blessing by the open hand of Christ, but were debarred from such good by the hand compressed and closed; and therefore their feet were tied, and \"they fell, while we are risen, and stand upright.\"[fn-28-P2848_1308971:23-nf] But although, as I have said, the Lord Christ did thus send before Him a certain portion of His body, in the person of those holy men who came before Him as regards the time of birth, nevertheless He is Himself the Head of the body, the Church,[fn-28-P2849_1309232:24-nf] and all these have been attached to that same body of which He is the head, in virtue of their believing in Him whom they announced prophetically. For they were: not sundered (from that body) in consequence of fulfilling their course before Him, but rather were they made one with the same by reason of their obedience. For although the hand may be put forward away before the head, still it has its connection beneath the head. Wherefore all things which were written aforetime were written in order that we might be taught thereby,[fn-28-P2850_1309783:25-nf] and were our figures, and happened in a figure in the ease of these men. Moreover they were written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages has come.[fn-28-P2851_1309955:26-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us consider, beloved, how the Lord continually proves to us that there shall be a future resurrection, of which He has rendered the Lord Jesus Christ[fn-54-P5472_792039:117-nf] the first-fruits[fn-54-P5473_792082:118-nf] by raising Him from the dead.

But who, except an heretical spirit, could ever bring his mind to believe that the invisible part of creation belongs to him who had previously displayed no visible thing, rather than to Him who, by His operation on the visible world, produced a belief in the invisible also, since it is far more reasonable to give one's assent after some samples (of a work) than after none? We shall see to what author even (your favourite) apostle attributes[fn-40-P4058_1327500:203-nf] the invisible creation, when we come to examine him. At present (we withhold his testimony), for[fn-40-P4059_1327615:204-nf] we are for the most part engaged in preparing the way, by means of common sense and fair arguments, for a belief in the future support of the Scriptures also. We affirm, then, that this diversity of things visible and invisible must on this ground be attributed to the Creator, even because the whole of His work consists of diversities-of things corporeal and incorporeal; of animate and inanimate; of vocal and mute of moveable and stationary; of productive and sterile; of arid and moist; of hot and cold. Man, too, is himself similarly tempered with diversity, both in his body and in his sensation. Some of his members are strong, others weak; some comely, others uncomely; some twofold, others unique; some like, others unlike. In like manner there is diversity also in his sensation: now joy, then anxiety; now love, then hatred; now anger, then calmness. Since this is the case, inasmuch as the whole of this creation of ours has been fashioned[fn-40-P4060_1328635:205-nf] with a reciprocal rivalry amongst its several parts, the invisible ones are due to the visible, and not to be ascribed to any other author than Him to whom their counterparts are imputed, marking as they do diversity in the Creator Himself, who orders what He forbade, and forbids what He ordered; who also strikes and heals. Why do they take Him to be uniform in one class of things alone, as the Creator of visible things, and only them; whereas He ought to be believed to have created both the visible and the invisible, in just the same way as life and death, or as evil things and peace?[fn-40-P4061_1329245:206-nf] And verily, if the invisible creatures are greater than the visible, which are in their own sphere great, so also is it fitting that the greater should be His to whom the great belong; because neither the great, nor indeed the greater, can be suitable property for one who seems to possess not even the smallest things.","title":"Book I.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_19_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"56. But I cannot describe Him, Whose pleas for me I cannot describe. As in the revelation that Thy Only-begotten was born of Thee before times eternal, when we cease to struggle with ambiguities of language and difficulties of thought, the one certainty of His birth remains; so I hold fast in my consciousness the truth that Thy Holy Spirit is from Thee and through Him, although I cannot by my intellect comprehend it. For in Thy spiritual things I am dull, as Thy Only-begotten says, Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be barn anew. The Spirit breathes where it will, and thou hearest the voice of it; but dost not know whence it comes or whither it goes. So is every one who is barn of water and of the Holy Spirit[fn-24-P2401_1541733:50-nf] . Though I hold a belief in my regeneration, I hold it in ignorance; I possess the reality, though I comprehend it not. For my own consciousness had no part in causing this new birth, which is manifest in its effects. Moreover the Spirit has no limits; He speaks when He will, and what He will, and where He will. Since, then, the cause of His coming and going is unknown, though the watcher is conscious of the fact, shall I count the nature of the Spirit among created things, and limit Him by fixing the time of His origin? Thy servant John says, indeed, that all things were made through the Son[fn-24-P2402_1542358:51-nf] , Who as God the Word was in the beginning, O God, with Thee. Again, Paul recounts all things as created in Him, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible[fn-24-P2403_1542535:52-nf] . And, while he declared that everything was created in Christ and through Christ, he thought, with respect to the Holy Spirit, that the description was sufficient, when he called Him Thy Spirit. With these men, peculiarly Thine elect, I will think in these matters; just as, after their example, I will say nothing beyond my comprehension about Thy Only-begotten, but simply declare that He was born, so also after their example I will not trespass beyond that which human intellect can know about Thy Holy Spirit, but simply declare that He is Thy Spirit.

By the abyss is meant the countless multitude of the wicked whose hearts are unfathomably deep in malignity against the Church of God; not that the devil was not there before, but he is said to be cast in thither, because, when prevented from harming believers, he takes more complete possession of the ungodly. For that man is more abundantly possessed by the devil who is not only alienated from God, but also gratuitously hates those who serve God. \"And shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled.\" \"Shut him up,\"-i.e., prohibited him from going out, from doing what was forbidden. And the addition of \"set a seal upon him\" seems to me to mean that it was designed to keep it a secret who belonged to the devil's party and who did not. For in this world this is a secret, for we cannot tell whether even the man who seems to stand shall fall, or whether he who seems to lie shall rise again. But by the chain and prison-house of this interdict the devil is prohibited and restrained from seducing those nations which belong to Christ, but which he formerly seduced or held in subjection. For before the foundation of the world God chose to rescue these from the power of darkness, and to translate them into the kingdom of the Son of His love, as the apostle says.[fn-38-P3834_2108231:36-nf] For what Christian is not aware that he seduces nations even now, and draws them with himself to eternal punishment, but not those predestined to eternal life? And let no one be dismayed by the circumstance that the devil often seduces even those who have been regenerated in Christ, and begun to walk in God's way. For \"the Lord knoweth them that are His,\"[fn-38-P3835_2108606:37-nf] and of these the devil seduces none to eternal damnation. For it is as God, from whom nothing is hid even of things future, that the Lord knows them; not as a man, who sees a man at the present time (if he can be said to see one whose heart he does not see), but does not see even himself so far as to be able to know what kind of person he is to be. The devil, then, is bound and shut up in the abyss that he may not seduce the nations from which the Church is gathered, and which he formerly seduced before the Church existed. For it is not said \"that he should not seduce any man,\" but \"that he should not seduce the nations\"-meaning, no doubt, those among which the Church exists-\"till the thousand years should be fulfilled,\"-i.e., either what remains of the sixth day which consists of a thousand years, or all the years which are to elapse till the end of the world.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_19_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"91.

And, indeed, on this subject of the Father and the Son, learned and spiritual[fn-32-P3259_1501126:77-nf] men have conducted discussions in many books, in which, so far as men could do with men, they have endeavored to introduce an intelligible account as to how the Father was not one personally with the Son, and yet the two were one substantially;[fn-32-P3260_1501447:78-nf] and as to what the Father was individually (proprie), and what the Son: to wit, that the former was the Begetter, the latter the Begotten; the formernot of the Son, the latter of the Father: theformer the Beginning of the latter, whence also He is called the Head of Christ,[fn-32-P3261_1501854:79-nf] although Christ likewise is the Beginning,[fn-32-P3262_1501917:80-nf] but not of the Father; the latter, moreover, the Image[fn-32-P3263_1502149:81-nf] of the former, although in no respect dissimilar, and although absolutely and without difference equal (omnino et indifferenter aequalis). These questions are handled with greater breadth by those who, in less narrow limits than ours are at present, seek to set forth the profession of the Christian faith in its totality. Accordingly, in so far as He is the Son, of the Father received He it that He is, while that other [the Father] received not this of the Son; and in so far as He, in unutterable mercy, in a temporal dispensation took upon Himself the [nature of] man (hominem),-to wit, the changeable creature that was thereby to be changed into something better,-many statements concerning Him are discovered in the Scriptures, which are so expressed as to have given occasion to error in the impious intellects of heretics, with whom the desire to teach takes precedence of that to understand, so that they have supposed Him to be neither equal with the Father nor of the same substance. Such statements [are meant] as the following: \"For the Father is greater than I;\"[fn-32-P3264_1503245:82-nf] and, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God;\"[fn-32-P3265_1503368:83-nf] and, \"Then shall He Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him;\"[fn-32-P3266_1503467:84-nf] and, \"I go to my Father and your Father, my God and your God,\"[fn-32-P3267_1503550:85-nf] together with some others of like tenor. Now all these have had a place given them, [certainly] not with the object of signifying an inequality of nature and substance; for to take them so would be to falsify a different class of statements, such as, \"I and my Father are one\" (unum);[fn-32-P3268_1503853:86-nf] and, \"He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also;\"[fn-32-P3269_1503923:87-nf] and, \"The Word was God,\"[fn-32-P3270_1503966:88-nf] for He was not made, inasmuch as \"all things were made by Him;\"[fn-32-P3271_1504046:89-nf] and, \"He thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\"[fn-32-P3272_1504117:90-nf] together with all the other passages of a similar order. But these statements have had a place given them, partly with a view to that administration of His assumption of human nature (administrationem suscepti hominis), in accordance with which it is said that \"He emptied Himself:\" not that that Wisdom was changed, since it is absolutely unchangeable; but that it was His will to make Himself known in such humble fashion to men. Partly then, I repeat, it is with a view to this administration that those things have been thus written which the heretics make the ground of their false allegations; and partly it was with a view to the consideration that the Son owes to the Father that which He is,[fn-32-P3273_1504849:91-nf] -thereby also certainly owing this in particular to the Father, to wit, that He is equal to the same Father, or that He is His Peer (eidem Patri aequalis aut par est), whereas the Father owes whatsoever He is to no one.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"185","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"I know that Satan has sought to sift you as wheat,[fn-57-P5710_1394375:118-nf] and that the Lord has allowed him so to do that He may shew the wheat, and prove the gold, crown the athletes, and proclaim the victors` names. Nevertheless I fear and tremble, not indeed distressed for the sake of you who are noble champions of the truth, but because I know that it comes to pass that some men are of feebler heart. If among twelve apostles one was found a traitor, there is no doubt that among a number many times as great any one might easily discover many falling short of perfection. Thus reflecting I have been confounded and filled with much discouragement, for, as says the divine Apostle, \"whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it.\"[fn-57-P5711_1395072:119-nf] \"We are members one of another,\"[fn-57-P5712_1395129:120-nf] and form one body, having the Lord Christ for head.[fn-57-P5713_1395201:121-nf] Yet one consolation I have in my anxiety, when I bethink me of your holiness. For brought up as you have been in the divine oracles, and taught by the arch-shepherd what are the good shepherd's marks, there is no doubt that you will lay down your life for the sheep. For, as the Lord says, \"he that is an hireling\" when he sees \"the wolf coming,\" \"fleeth because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep,\" but \"the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.\"[fn-57-P5714_1395688:122-nf] Just so it is not in peace that the best general shews his inborn valour, but in time of war, by at once stimulating others and himself exposing himself to peril for his men. For it would be preposterous that he should enjoy the dignity of his command, and, in the hour of need, run out of danger's way. Thus the thrice blessed prophets ever acted, making light of the safety of their bodies, and, for the sake of the Jews who hated and rejected them, underwent all kinds of peril and toil. Of them the divine apostle says \"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\"[fn-57-P5715_1396536:123-nf] Thus the divine apostles travelled preaching over all the world, without home, bed, bedding, board, or any of the necessaries of life, but scourged, racked, imprisoned, and undergoing countless kinds of death. And all this they underwent, not for the sake of their friends, but voluntarily facing these perils for the sake of the men who were persecuting them. A far stronger claim is made on you now to accept the peril at present assailing you, for the sake of fellow-believers and brothers and children. This affection is shown even by unreasoning animals, for sparrows may be seen fighting with all their force in behalf of their brood, and putting out in their defence all the strength they have; other kinds of birds moreover undergo danger for their young. But why do I speak of birds? Bears too, and leopards, wolves, and lions, voluntarily suffer any pain for the safety of their offspring, for instead of fleeing from the hunter they will await his attack and do battle for their young.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"297","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Thus have I been forced to write on reading your lordship's letter, and on learning from it how for these reasons a great commotion has been made against me, a man confined to my diocese; a man of peace; one not evendeliberating with the godly bishops of the province.

The Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they endeavoured to steep in all sorts of evil the very nature of God itself, and not His creature, made out of nothing. For evil arose in nothing else than what was good-not, however, the supreme and unchangeable good which is God's nature, but that which was made out of nothing by the wisdom of God. This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine work; for he would not be man unless he were made by the operation of God.

This shall now be proved even by the apostle, when he says: \"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; which is come unto you, as it is unto all the world.\"[fn-80-P8067_2292629:866-nf] For if, even at that time, the tradition of the gospel had spread everywhere, how much more now! Now, if it is our gospel which has spread everywhere, rather than any heretical gospel, much less Marcion's, which only dates from the reign of Antoninus,[fn-80-P8068_2292902:867-nf] then ours will be the gospel of the apostles. But should Marcion's gospel succeed in filling the whole world, it would not even in that case be entitled to the character of apostolic. For this quality, it will be evident, can only belong to that gospel which was the first to fill the world; in other words, to the gospel of that God who of old declared this of its promulgation: \"Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8069_2293434:868-nf] He calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-80-P8070_2293503:869-nf] We in like manner say that the Father of Christ is invisible, for we know that it was the Son who was seen in ancient times (whenever any appearance was vouchsafed to men in the name of God) as the image of (the Father) Himself. He must not be regarded, however, as making any difference between a visible and an invisible God; because long before he wrote this we find a description of our God to this effect: \"No man can see the Lord, and live.\"[fn-80-P8071_2293970:870-nf] If Christ is not \"the first-begotten before every creature,\"[fn-80-P8072_2294054:871-nf] as that \"Word of God by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-80-P8073_2294295:872-nf] if \"all things were\" not \"in Him created, whether in heaven or on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; \"if \"all things were\" not \"created by Him and for Him\" (for these truths Marcion ought not to allow concerning Him), then the apostle could not have so positively laid it down, that \"He is before all.\"[fn-80-P8074_2294679:873-nf] For how is He before all, if He is not before all things?[fn-80-P8075_2294756:874-nf] How, again, is He before all things, if He is not \"the first-born of every creature\"-if He is not the Word of the Creator?[fn-80-P8076_2294898:875-nf] Now how will he be proved to have been before all things, who appeared after all things? Who can tell whether he had a prior existence, when he has found no proof that he had any existence at all? In what way also could it have \"pleased (the Father) that in Him should all fulness dwell? \"[fn-80-P8077_2295227:876-nf] For, to begin with, what fulness is that which is not comprised of the constituents which Marcion has removed from it,-even those that were \"created in Christ, whether in heaven or on earth,\" whether angels or men? which is not made of the things that are visible and invisible? which consists not of thrones and dominions and principalities and powers? If, on the other hand,[fn-80-P8078_2295623:877-nf] our false apostles and Judaizing gospellers[fn-80-P8079_2295682:878-nf] have introduced all these things out of their own stores, and Martian has applied them to constitute the fulness of his own god, (this hypothesis, absurd though it be, alone would justify him; ) for how, on any other supposition,[fn-80-P8080_2295937:879-nf] could the rival and the destroyer of the Creator have been willing that His fulness should dwell in his Christ? To whom, again, does He \"reconcile all things by Himself, making peace by the blood of His cross,\"[fn-80-P8081_2296170:880-nf] but to Him whom those very things had altogether[fn-80-P8082_2296238:881-nf] offended, against whom they had rebelled by transgression, (but) to whom they had at last returned?[fn-80-P8083_2296397:882-nf] Conciliated they might have been to a strange god; but reconciled they could not possibly have been to any other than their own God. Accordingly, ourselves \"who were sometime alienated and enemies in our mind by wicked works\"[fn-80-P8084_2296655:883-nf] does He reconcile to the Creator, against whom we had committed offence-worshipping the creature to the prejudice of the Creator. As, however, he says elsewhere,[fn-80-P8085_2296836:884-nf] that the Church is the body of Christ, so here also (the apostle) declares that he \"fills up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church.\"[fn-80-P8086_2297054:885-nf] But you must not on this account suppose that on every mention of His body the term is only a metaphor, instead of meaning real flesh. For he says above that we are \"reconciled in His body through death; \"[fn-80-P8087_2297279:886-nf] meaning, of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore he adds, ) not through the Church[fn-80-P8088_2297435:887-nf] (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church (proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body-one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again, he warns them to \"beware of subtle words and philosophy,\" as being \"a vain deceit,\" such as is \"after the rudiments of the world\" (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of sky and earth, but worldly learning, and \"the tradition of men,\" subtle in their speech and their philosophy),[fn-80-P8089_2297958:888-nf] it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to show how in this sentence (of the apostle's) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus, implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;[fn-80-P8090_2298372:889-nf] wherefore he refuses to say that He is an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and places it on a par with the Divine Creator.[fn-80-P8091_2299157:890-nf] He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,-a truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.[fn-80-P8092_2299442:891-nf] But how remote is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that Christ was born of the virgin's womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very heathen, laugh and jeer. For \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise\"[fn-80-P8093_2300031:892-nf] -that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His threatened long before that He would \"destroy the wisdom of the wise.\"[fn-80-P8094_2300194:893-nf] Thanks to this simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments.

Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ.

If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow.

For this quality, it will be evident, can only belong to that gospel which was the first to fill the world; in other words, to the gospel of that God who of old declared this of its promulgation: \"Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8069_2293434:868-nf] He calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-80-P8070_2293503:869-nf] We in like manner say that the Father of Christ is invisible, for we know that it was the Son who was seen in ancient times (whenever any appearance was vouchsafed to men in the name of God) as the image of (the Father) Himself. He must not be regarded, however, as making any difference between a visible and an invisible God; because long before he wrote this we find a description of our God to this effect: \"No man can see the Lord, and live.\"[fn-80-P8071_2293970:870-nf] If Christ is not \"the first-begotten before every creature,\"[fn-80-P8072_2294054:871-nf] as that \"Word of God by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-80-P8073_2294295:872-nf] if \"all things were\" not \"in Him created, whether in heaven or on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; \"if \"all things were\" not \"created by Him and for Him\" (for these truths Marcion ought not to allow concerning Him), then the apostle could not have so positively laid it down, that \"He is before all.\"[fn-80-P8074_2294679:873-nf] For how is He before all, if He is not before all things?[fn-80-P8075_2294756:874-nf] How, again, is He before all things, if He is not \"the first-born of every creature\"-if He is not the Word of the Creator?[fn-80-P8076_2294898:875-nf] Now how will he be proved to have been before all things, who appeared after all things? Who can tell whether he had a prior existence, when he has found no proof that he had any existence at all? In what way also could it have \"pleased (the Father) that in Him should all fulness dwell? \"[fn-80-P8077_2295227:876-nf] For, to begin with, what fulness is that which is not comprised of the constituents which Marcion has removed from it,-even those that were \"created in Christ, whether in heaven or on earth,\" whether angels or men? which is not made of the things that are visible and invisible? which consists not of thrones and dominions and principalities and powers? If, on the other hand,[fn-80-P8078_2295623:877-nf] our false apostles and Judaizing gospellers[fn-80-P8079_2295682:878-nf] have introduced all these things out of their own stores, and Martian has applied them to constitute the fulness of his own god, (this hypothesis, absurd though it be, alone would justify him; ) for how, on any other supposition,[fn-80-P8080_2295937:879-nf] could the rival and the destroyer of the Creator have been willing that His fulness should dwell in his Christ? To whom, again, does He \"reconcile all things by Himself, making peace by the blood of His cross,\"[fn-80-P8081_2296170:880-nf] but to Him whom those very things had altogether[fn-80-P8082_2296238:881-nf] offended, against whom they had rebelled by transgression, (but) to whom they had at last returned?[fn-80-P8083_2296397:882-nf] Conciliated they might have been to a strange god; but reconciled they could not possibly have been to any other than their own God. Accordingly, ourselves \"who were sometime alienated and enemies in our mind by wicked works\"[fn-80-P8084_2296655:883-nf] does He reconcile to the Creator, against whom we had committed offence-worshipping the creature to the prejudice of the Creator. As, however, he says elsewhere,[fn-80-P8085_2296836:884-nf] that the Church is the body of Christ, so here also (the apostle) declares that he \"fills up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church.\"[fn-80-P8086_2297054:885-nf] But you must not on this account suppose that on every mention of His body the term is only a metaphor, instead of meaning real flesh. For he says above that we are \"reconciled in His body through death; \"[fn-80-P8087_2297279:886-nf] meaning, of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore he adds, ) not through the Church[fn-80-P8088_2297435:887-nf] (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church (proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body-one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again, he warns them to \"beware of subtle words and philosophy,\" as being \"a vain deceit,\" such as is \"after the rudiments of the world\" (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of sky and earth, but worldly learning, and \"the tradition of men,\" subtle in their speech and their philosophy),[fn-80-P8089_2297958:888-nf] it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to show how in this sentence (of the apostle's) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus, implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;[fn-80-P8090_2298372:889-nf] wherefore he refuses to say that He is an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and places it on a par with the Divine Creator.[fn-80-P8091_2299157:890-nf] He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,-a truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.[fn-80-P8092_2299442:891-nf] But how remote is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that Christ was born of the virgin's womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very heathen, laugh and jeer. For \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise\"[fn-80-P8093_2300031:892-nf] -that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His threatened long before that He would \"destroy the wisdom of the wise.\"[fn-80-P8094_2300194:893-nf] Thanks to this simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God. When, therefore, he speaks of their \"following the commandments and doctrines of men,\"[fn-80-P8098_2302162:897-nf] he refers to the conduct of those persons who \"held not the Head,\" even Him in whom all things are gathered together;[fn-80-P8099_2302300:898-nf] for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him as their initiating principle[fn-81-P8100_2302423:899-nf] -even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their nature. All the rest of his precepts,[fn-81-P8101_2302536:900-nf] as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them as they occurred in another epistle,[fn-81-P8102_2302664:901-nf] emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting that \"old things were to pass away,\" and that He would \"make all things new,\"[fn-81-P8103_2302902:902-nf] commanded men \"to break up fresh ground for themselves,\"[fn-81-P8104_2303013:903-nf] and thereby taught them even then to put off the old man and put on the new.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I am accustomed in my prescription against all heresies, to fix my compendious criterion[fn-80-P8066_2292235:865-nf] (of truth) in the testimony of time; claiming priority therein as our rule, and alleging lateness to be the characteristic of every heresy. This shall now be proved even by the apostle, when he says: \"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; which is come unto you, as it is unto all the world.\"[fn-80-P8067_2292629:866-nf] For if, even at that time, the tradition of the gospel had spread everywhere, how much more now!

But while he exposes these tempers as the sole cause of the diversity, he avoids inculpating the regular mysteries of the faith,[fn-81-P8110_2304408:906-nf] and affirms that there is, notwithstanding, but one Christ and His one God, whatever motives men had in preaching Him. Therefore, says he, it matters not to me \"whether it be in pretence or in truth that Christ is preached,\"[fn-81-P8111_2304663:907-nf] because one Christ alone was announced, whether in their \"pretentious\" or their \"truthful\" faith. For it was to the faithfulness of their preaching that he applied the word truth, not to the rightness of the rule itself, because there was indeed but one rule; whereas the conduct of the preachers varied: in some of them it was true, i. e. single-minded, while in others it was sophisticated with over-much learning. This being the case, it is manifest that that Christ was the subject of their preaching who was always the theme of the prophets. Now, if it were a completely different Christ that was being introduced by the apostle, the novelty of the thing would have produced a diversity (in belief.). For there would not have been wanting, in spite of the novel teaching,[fn-81-P8112_2305460:908-nf] men to interpret the preached gospel of the Creator's Christ, since the majority of persons everywhere now-a-days are of our way of thinking, rather than on the heretical side. So that the apostle would not in such a passage as the present one have refrained from remarking and censuring the diversity. Since, however, there is no blame of a diversity, there is no proof of a novelty. Of course[fn-81-P8113_2305875:909-nf] the Marcionites suppose that they have the apostle on their side in the following passage in the matter of Christ's substance-that in Him there was nothing but a phantom of flesh. For he says of Christ, that, \"being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God;[fn-81-P8114_2306173:910-nf] but emptied[fn-81-P8115_2306249:911-nf] Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant,\" not the reality, \"and was made in the likeness of man,\" not a man, \"and was found in fashion as a man,\"[fn-81-P8116_2306431:912-nf] not in his substance, that is to say, his flesh; just as if to a substance there did not accrue both form and likeness and fashion. It is well for us that in another passage (the apostle) calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-81-P8117_2306690:913-nf] For will it not follow with equal force from that passage, that Christ is not truly God, because the apostle places Him in the image of God, if, (as Marcion contends, ) He is not truly man because of His having taken on Him the form or image of a man? For in both cases the true substance will have to be excluded, if image (or \"fashion\") and likeness and form shall be claimed for a phantom. But since he is truly God, as the Son of the Father, in His fashion and image, He has been already by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, \"found in the fashion \"and image\" of a man.\" For when he propounded[fn-81-P8118_2307348:914-nf] Him as thus \"found\" in the manner[fn-81-P8119_2307397:915-nf] of a man, he in fact affirmed Him to be most certainly human. For what is found, manifestly possesses existence. Therefore, as He was found to be God by His mighty power, so was He found to be man by reason of His flesh, because the apostle could not have pronounced Him to have \"become obedient unto death,\"[fn-81-P8120_2307731:916-nf] if He had not been constituted of a mortal substance. Still more plainly does this appear from the apostle's additional words, \"even the death of the cross.\"[fn-81-P8121_2307909:917-nf] For he could hardly mean this to be a climax[fn-81-P8122_2307974:918-nf] to the human suffering, to extol the virtue[fn-81-P8123_2308047:919-nf] of His obedience, if he had known it all to be the imaginary process of a phantom, which rather eluded the cross than experienced it, and which displayed no virtue[fn-81-P8124_2308247:920-nf] in the suffering, but only illusion. But \"those things which he had once accounted gain,\" and which he enumerates in the preceding verse-\"trust in the flesh,\" the sign of \"circumcision,\" his origin as \"an Hebrew of the Hebrews,\" his descent from \"the tribe of Benjamin,\" his dignity in the honours of the Pharisee[fn-81-P8125_2308592:921-nf] -he now reckons to be only \"loss\" to himself;[fn-81-P8126_2308686:922-nf] (in other words, ) it was not the God of the Jews, but their stupid obduracy, which he repudiates. These are also the things \"which he counts but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ\"[fn-81-P8127_2308905:923-nf] (but by no means for the rejection of God the Creator); \"whilst he has not his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" i.e. Christ, \"the righteousness which is of God.\"[fn-81-P8128_2309127:924-nf] Then, say you, according to this distinction the law did not proceed from the God of Christ. Subtle enough! But here is something still more subtle for you. For when (the apostle) says, \"Not (the righteousness) which is of the law, but that which is through Him,\" he would not have used the phrase through Him of any other than Him to whom the law belonged. \"Our conversation,\" says he, \"is in heaven.\"[fn-81-P8129_2309551:925-nf] I here recognise the Creator's ancient promise to Abraham: \"I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven.\"[fn-81-P8130_2309683:926-nf] Therefore \"one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-81-P8131_2309764:927-nf] If, again, Christ in His advent from heaven \"shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body,\"[fn-81-P8132_2309928:928-nf] it follows that this body of ours shall rise again, which is now in a state of humiliation in its sufferings and according to the law of mortality drops into the ground. But how shall it be changed, if it shall have no real existence?

Now the Gospel is a discourse containing a promise of things which naturally, and on account of the benefits they bring, rejoice the hearer as soon as the promise is heard and believed. Nor is such a discourse any the less a Gospel that we define it with reference to the position of the hearer. A Gospel is either a word which implies the actual presence to the believer of something that is good, or a word promising the arrival of a good which is expected. Now all these definitions apply to those books which are named Gospels. For each of the Gospels is a collection of announcements which are useful to him who believes them and does not misinterpret them; it brings him a benefit and naturally makes him glad because it tells of the sojourn with men, on account of men, and for their salvation, of the first-born of all creation,[fn-61-P6144_941828:31-nf] Christ Jesus. And again each Gospel tells of the sojourn of the good Father in the Son with those minded to receive Him, as is plain to every believer; and moreover by these books a good is announced which had been formerly expected, as is by no means hard to see. For John the Baptist spoke in the name almost of the whole people when he sent to Jesus and asked,[fn-61-P6145_942209:32-nf] \"Art thou He that should come or do we look for another? \"For to the people the Messiah was an expected good, which the prophets had foretold, and they all alike, though under the law and the prophets, fixed their hopes on Him, as the Samaritan woman bears witness when she says:[fn-61-P6146_942507:33-nf] \"I know that the Messiah comes, who is called Christ; when He comes He will tell us all things.\" Simon and Cleopas too, when talking to each other about all that had happened to Jesus Christ Himself, then risen, though they did not know that He had risen, from the dead, speak thus,[fn-61-P6147_942808:34-nf] \"Dost thou sojourn alone in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things which have taken place there in these days? And when he said what things? they answered, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth,[fn-61-P6148_943027:35-nf] which was a prophet, mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death and crucified Him. But we hoped that it was He which should redeem Israel.\" Again, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter found his own brother Simon and said to him,[fn-61-P6149_943368:36-nf] \"We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ.\" And a little further on Philip finds Nathanael and says to him,[fn-61-P6150_943515:37-nf] \"We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.\"","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let no one wonder if we have understood Jesus to be announced in the Gospel under a plurality of names of good things.

And these things those preach who preach Jesus, saying[fn-61-P6178_954801:52-nf] that He is made to be of God righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Hence we shall have writings about Him without number, showing that Jesus is a multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which actually exist in Him in whom[fn-61-P6179_955156:53-nf] \"it pleased God that the whole fulness of the Godhead should dwell bodily.\" and which are not contained in writings. Why should I say, \"are not contained in writings\"?

And the Lord saith, When a tree shall be bent down, and again arise, and when blood shall flow out of wood.\"[fn-33-P3331_565653:163-nf] Here again you have an intimation concerning the cross, and Him who should be crucified. Yet again He speaks of this[fn-33-P3332_565845:164-nf] in Moses, when Israel was attacked by strangers. And that He might remind them, when assailed, that it was on account of their sins they were delivered to death, the Spirit speaks to the heart of Moses, that he should make a figure of the cross,[fn-33-P3333_566137:165-nf] and of Him about to suffer thereon; for unless they put their trust in Him, they shall be overcome for ever. Moses therefore placed one weapon above another in the midst of the hill,[fn-33-P3334_566350:166-nf] and standing upon it, so as to be higher than all the people, he stretched forth his hands,[fn-33-P3335_566735:167-nf] and thus again Israel acquired the mastery. But when again he let down his hands, they were again destroyed. For what reason? That they might know that they could not be saved unless they put their trust in Him.[fn-33-P3336_566992:168-nf] And in another prophet He declares, \"All day long I have stretched forth My hands to an unbelieving people, and one that gainsays My righteous way.\"[fn-33-P3337_567182:169-nf] And again Moses makes a type of Jesus, [signifying] that it was necessary for Him to suffer, [and also] that He would be the author of life[fn-33-P3338_567342:170-nf] [to others], whom they believed to have destroyed on the cross[fn-33-P3339_567458:171-nf] when Israel was failing. For since transgression was committed by Eve through means of the serpent, [the Lord] brought it to pass that every [kind of] serpents bit them, and they died,[fn-33-P3340_567673:172-nf] that He might convince them, that on account of their transgression they were given over to the straits of death. Moreover Moses, when he commanded, \"Ye shall not have any graven or molten [image] for your God,\"[fn-33-P3341_567929:173-nf] did so that he might reveal a type of Jesus. Moses then makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,[fn-33-P3342_568097:174-nf] and by proclamation assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses that he would offer sacrifice[fn-33-P3343_568356:175-nf] in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them, saying, \"When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead, it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be restored.\"[fn-33-P3344_568691:176-nf] And they did so. Thou hast in this also [an indication of] the glory of Jesus; for in Him and to Him are all things.[fn-33-P3345_568828:177-nf] What, again, says Moses to Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nave, when he gave him[fn-33-P3346_568929:178-nf] this name, as being a prophet, with this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would reveal all things concerning His Son Jesus to the son[fn-33-P3347_569169:179-nf] of Nave? This name then being given him when he sent him to spy out the land, he said, \"Take a book into thy hands, and write what the Lord declares, that the Son of God will in the last days cut off from the roots all the house of Amalek.\"[fn-33-P3348_569505:180-nf] Behold again: Jesus who was manifested, both by type and in the flesh,[fn-33-P3349_569597:181-nf] is not the Son of man, but the Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to say that Christ was the son[fn-33-P3350_569728:182-nf] of David, fearing and understanding the error of the wicked, he saith, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-33-P3351_569965:183-nf] And again, thus saith Isaiah, \"The Lord said to Christ,[fn-33-P3352_570058:184-nf] my Lord, whose right hand I have holden,[fn-33-P3353_570145:185-nf] that the nations should yield obedience before Him; and I will break in pieces the strength of kings.\"[fn-33-P3354_570291:186-nf] Behold how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.","title":"The Epistle of Barnabas","author":"Barnabas"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"113","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The apostle indeed teaches, in his Epistle to the Colossians, that we were once dead, alienated, and enemies to the Lord in our minds, whilst we were living in wicked works;[fn-98-P9895_2734018:147-nf] that we were then buried with Christ in baptism, and also raised again with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead.[fn-98-P9896_2734195:148-nf] \"And you, (adds he), when ye were dead in sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath He quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses.\"[fn-98-P9897_2734374:149-nf] And again: \"If ye are dead with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances? \"[fn-98-P9898_2734529:150-nf] Now, since he makes us spiritually dead-in such a way, however, as to allow that we shall one day have to undergo a bodily death,-so, considering indeed that we have been also raised in a like spiritual sense, he equally allows that we shall further have to undergo a bodily resurrection. In so many words[fn-98-P9899_2734914:151-nf] he says: \"Since ye are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.\"[fn-99-P9900_2735119:152-nf] Accordingly, it is in our mind that he shows that we rise (with Christ), since it is by this alone that we are as yet able to reach to heavenly objects. These we should not \"seek,\" nor \"set our affection on,\" if we had them already in our possession. He also adds: \"For ye are dead\"-to your sins, he means, not to yourselves-\"and your life is hid with Christ in God.\"[fn-99-P9901_2735510:153-nf] Now that life is not yet apprehended which is hidden. In like manner John says: \"And it doth not yet appear what we shall be: we know, however, that when He shall be manifest, we shall be like Him.\"[fn-99-P9902_2735725:154-nf] We are far indeed from being already what we know not of; we should, of course, be sure to know it if we were already (like Him). It is therefore the contemplation of our blessed hope even in this life by faith (that he speaks of)-not its presence nor its possession, but only its expectation. Concerning this expectation and hope Paul writes to the Galatians: \"For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-99-P9903_2736181:155-nf] He says \"we wait for it,\" not we are in possession of it. By the righteousness of God, he means that judgment which we shall have to undergo as the recompense of our deeds. It is in expectation of this for himself that the apostle writes to the Philippians: \"If by any means,\" says he, \"I might attain to the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect.\"[fn-99-P9904_2736598:156-nf] And yet he had believed, and had known all mysteries, as an elect vessel and the great teacher of the Gentiles; but for all that he goes on to say: \"I, however, follow on, if so be I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of Christ.\"[fn-99-P9905_2736870:157-nf] Nay, more: \"Brethren,\" (he adds), \"I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing (I do), forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of blamelessness,[fn-99-P9906_2737141:158-nf] whereby I may attain it; \"meaning the resurrection from the dead in its proper time. Even as he says to the Galatians: \"Let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap.\"[fn-99-P9907_2737486:159-nf] Similarly, concerning Onesiphorus, does he also write to Timothy: \"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy in that day; \"[fn-99-P9908_2737634:160-nf] unto which day and time he charges Timothy himself \"to keep what had been committed to his care, without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ: which in His times He shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,\"[fn-99-P9909_2737936:161-nf] speaking of (Him as) God It is to these same times that Peter in the Acts refers, when he says: \"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of His holy prophets.\"[fn-99-P9910_2738409:162-nf] ","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"45.

He became also the Son of God, and was begotten when He proceeded forth from Him. Do you then, (you ask, ) grant that the Word is a certain substance, constructed by the Spirit and the communication of Wisdom? Certainly I do. But you will not allow Him to be really a substantive being, by having a substance of His own; in such a way that He may be regarded as an objective thing and a person, and so be able (as being constituted second to God the Father, ) to make two, the Father and the Son, God and the Word. For you will say, what is a word, but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the grammarians teach) air when struck against,[fn-104-P10472_2933938:74-nf] intelligible to the ear, but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and incorporeal thing. I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and void could have come forth from God, seeing that it is not put forth from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly be devoid of substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has produced such mighty substances: for all things which were made through Him, He Himself (personally) made. How could it be, that He Himself is nothing, without whom nothing was made? How could He who is empty have made things which are solid, and He who is void have made things which are full, and He who is incorporeal have made things which have body? For although a thing may sometimes be made different from him by whom it is made, yet nothing can be made by that which is a void and empty thing. Is that Word of God, then, a void and empty thing, which is called the Son, who Himself is designated God? \"The Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-104-P10473_2934954:75-nf] It is written, \"Thou shalt not take God's name in vain.\"[fn-104-P10474_2935027:76-nf] This for certain is He \"who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-104-P10475_2935144:77-nf] In what form of God? Of course he means in some form, not in none. For who will deny that God is a body, although \"God is a Spirit? \"[fn-104-P10476_2935296:78-nf] For Spirit has a bodily substance of its own kind, in its own form.[fn-104-P10477_2935382:79-nf] Now, even if invisible things, whatsoever they be, have both their substance and their form in God, whereby they are visible to God alone, how much more shall that which has been sent forth from His substance not be without substance! Whatever, therefore, was the substance of the Word that I designate a Person, I claim for it the name of Son; and while I recognize the Son, I assert His distinction as second to the Father.[fn-104-P10478_2936047:80-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":43,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"For the Holy Scripture testifies that God's mercy is then also necessary for them, when the Saint says to his soul concerning the Lord its God, \"Who crowneth thee in mercy and compassion.\"[fn-65-P6590_2516316:147-nf] The Apostle James also says: \"He shall have judgment without mercy who hath showed no mercy;\"[fn-65-P6591_2516430:148-nf] where he sets forth thateven in that judgment in which the righteous are crowned and the unrighteous are condemned, some will be judged with mercy, others without mercy.

For when it is said, \"Judgment without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy,\" it is plainly shown that in those in whom are found the good works of mercy, judgment shall be executed with mercy; and thus even that mercy itself shall be returned to the merits of good works. It is not so now; when not only no good works, but many bad works precede, His mercy anticipates a man so that he is delivered from evils,-as well from evils which he has done, as from those which he would have done if he were not controlled by the grace of God; and from those, too, which he would have suffered for ever if he were not plucked from the power of darkness, and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God's love.[fn-65-P6595_2517951:152-nf] Nevertheless, since even that life eternal itself, which, it is certain, is given as due to good works, is called by so great an apostle the grace of God, although grace is not rendered to works, but is given freely, it must be confessed without any doubt, that eternal life is called grace for the reason that it is rendered to those merits which grace has conferred upon man.

And if you should ask of me what is my opinion regarding the Only-begotten Himself, whether the nature of God, which is naturally invisible, be not visible even to Him, let not such a question appear to you at once to be either absurd or impious, because we shall give you a logical reason. It is one thing to see, and another to know: to see and to be seen is a property of bodies; to know and to be known, an attribute of intellectual being. Whatever, therefore, is a property of bodies, cannot be predicated either of the Father or of the Son; but what belongs to the nature of deity is common to the Father and the Son.[fn-62-P6273_1119550:19-nf] Finally, even He Himself, in the Gospel, did not say that no one has seen the Father, save the Son, nor any one the Son, save the Father; but His words are: \"No one knoweth the Son, save the Father; nor any one the Father, save the Son.\"[fn-62-P6274_1119827:20-nf] By which it is clearly shown, that whatever among bodily natures is called seeing and being seen, is termed, between the Father and the Son, a knowing and being known, by means of the power of knowledge, not by the frailness of the sense of sight.

And therefore we have first to ascertain what the only-begotten Son of God is, seeing He is called by many different names, according to the circumstances and views of individuals.

We have now to ascertain what those matters are which it is proper to treat in the following pages according to our dogmatic belief, i.e., in agreement with the creed of the Church. All souls and all rational natures, whether holy or wicked, were formed or created, and all these, according to their proper nature, are incorporeal; but although incorporeal, they were nevertheless created, because all things were made by God through Christ, as John teaches in a general way in his Gospel, saying, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

But as those who uphold this heresy are sometimes accustomed to mislead the hearts of the simple by certain deceptive sophisms, I do not consider it improper to bring forward the assertions which they are in the habit of making, and to refute their deceit and falsehood. The following, then, are their declarations. It is written, that \"no man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-65-P6540_1289485:48-nf] But that God whom Moses preaches was both seen by Moses himself, and by his fathers before him; whereas He who is announced by the Saviour has never been seen at all by any one. Let us therefore ask them and ourselves whether they maintain that He whom they acknowledge to be God, and allege to be a different God from the Creator, is visible or invisible. And if they shall say that He is visible, besides being proved to go against the declaration of Scripture, which says of the Saviour, \"He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature,\"[fn-65-P6541_1290067:49-nf] they will fall also into the absurdity of asserting that God is corporeal. For nothing can be seen except by help of form, and size, and colour, which are special properties of bodies. And if God is declared to be a body, then He will also be found to be material, since every body is composed of matter. But if He be composed of matter, and matter is undoubtedly corruptible, then, according to them, God is liable to corruption! We shall put to them a second question. Is matter made, or is it uncreated, i.e., not made? And if they shall answer that it is not made, i.e., uncreated, we shall ask them if one portion of matter is God, and the other part the world? But if they shall say of matter that it is made, it will undoubtedly follow that they confess Him whom they declare to be God to have been made!-a result which certainly neither their reason nor ours can admit. But they will say, God is invisible. And what will you do? If you say that He is invisible by nature, then neither ought He to be visible to the Saviour. Whereas, on the contrary, God, the Father of Christ, is said to be seen, because \"he who sees the Son,\" he says, \"sees also the Father.\"[fn-65-P6542_1291253:50-nf] This certainly would press us very hard, were the expression not understood by us more correctly of understanding, and not of seeing. For he who has understood the Son will understand the Father also. In this way, then, Moses too must be supposed to have seen God, not beholding Him with the bodily eye, but understanding Him with the vision of the heart and the perception of the mind, and that only in some degree. For it is manifest that He, viz., who gave answers to Moses, said, \"You shall not see My face, but My hinder parts.\"[fn-65-P6543_1291805:51-nf] These words are, of course, to be understood in that mystical sense which is befitting divine words, those old wives' fables being rejected and despised which are invented by ignorant persons respecting the anterior and posterior parts of God. Let no one indeed suppose that we have indulged any feeling of impiety in saying that even to the Saviour the Father is not visible. Let him consider the distinction which we employ in dealing with heretics. For we have explained that it is one thing to see and to be seen, and another to know and to be known, or to understand and to be understood.[fn-65-P6544_1292428:52-nf] To see, then, and to be seen, is a property of bodies, which certainly will not be appropriately applied either to the Father, or to the Son, or to the Holy Spirit, in their mutual relations with one another. For the nature of the Trinity surpasses the measure of vision, granting to those who are in the body, i.e., to all other creatures, the property of vision in reference to one another. But to a nature that is incorporeal and for the most part intellectual, no other attribute is appropriate save that of knowing or being known, as the Saviour Himself declares when He says, \"No man knoweth the Son, save the Father; nor does any one know the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.\"[fn-65-P6545_1293230:53-nf] It is clear, then, that He has not said, \"No one has seen the Father, save the Son; \"but, \"No one knoweth the Father, save the Son.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-04","text":"1.

Consider whether the Apostle does not say the same thing when he speaks thus of Christ:[fn-86-P8668_2177702:32-nf] \"Who is the image of the invisible God, the first born of every creature.\" The nature of God is not, as some think, visible to some and not to others, for the Apostle does not say The image of God who is invisible to men, or to sinners; but he speaks quite distinctly of the nature of God in itself, where he says \"The image of the invisible God.\" John also says in his Gospel,[fn-86-P8669_2178097:33-nf] \"No man hath seen God at any time,\" by which he distinctly declares: to all who can understand, that there is no being to whom God is visible; not as if he were naturallyvisible and, like a being of attenuated substance.escaped and eluded our glance; but that, in his own nature it is impossible for him to be seen. But perhaps you will ask me my opinion as to the Only begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even to him the nature of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible, do not dismiss my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for I will at once give you my reason for it. Observe that seeing is a different thing from knowing. Seeing and being seen belong to bodies; to know and to be known belong to the intellectual nature. Whatever then is merely a property of bodies, this we must not attribute to the Father or the Son; but that which belongs to the nature of Deity governs the relations of the Father and the Son. Moreover, Christ himself in the Gospel[fn-86-P8670_2179109:34-nf] did not say \"No man seeth the Son but the Father nor the Father but the Son,\" but \"No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither doth any one know the Father but the Son.\" By this it is clearly shown that what is called seeing and being seen in the case of bodily existence is called knowledge in the case of the Father and the Son: their intercourse is maintained through the power of knowledge not through the weakness of visibility. Since, therefore, an incorporeal nature cannot properly be said to see or to be seen, therefore in the Gospel it is not said either that the Father is seen by the Son or the Son by the Father but that each is known by the other.

Because that discussion was undertaken for the sake of those who deny that the origin of evil\nis derived from the free choice of the will, and contend that God,-if He be so,-as the Creator of all\nnatures, is worthy of blame; desiring in that manner, according to the error of their impiety (for\nthey are Manicheans), to introduce a certain immutable nature of evil co-eternal with God.\" Also,\nafter a little time, in another place I say: \"Then it was said, From this misery, most righteously\ninflicted on sinners, God's grace delivers, because man of his own accord, that is, by free will,\ncould fall, but could not also rise. To this misery of just condemnation belong the ignorance and the\ndifficulty which every man suffers from the beginning of his birth, and no one is delivered from that\nevil except by the grace of God. And this misery the Pelagians will not have to descend from a just\ncondemnation, because they deny original sin; although even if the ignorance and difficulty were the\nnatural beginnings of man, God would not even thus deserve to be reproached, but to be praised, as I\nhave argued in the same third book.[fn-70-P7075_2703374:56-nf] Which\nargument must be regarded as against the Manicheans, who do not receive the holy Scriptures of the\nOld Testament, in which original sin is narrated; and whatever thence is read in the apostolic\nepistles, they contend was introduced with a detestable impudence by the corrupters of the\nScriptures, assuming that it was not said by the apostles. But against the Pelagians that must be\nmaintained which both Scriptures commend, as they profess to receive them.\" These things I said in my\nfirst book of Retractations, when I was reconsidering the books on Free Will. Nor, indeed,\nwere these things all that were said by me there about these books, but there were many others also,\nwhich I thought it would be tedious to insert in this work for you, and not necessary; and this I\nthink you also will judge when you have read all. Although, therefore, in the third book on Free Will\nI have in such wise argued concerning infants, that even if what the Pelagians say were true,-that\nignorance and difficulty, without which no man is born, are elements, not punishments, of our\nnature,-still the Manicheans would be overcome, who will have it that the two natures, to wit, of\ngood and evil; are co-eternal. Is, therefore, the faith to be called in question or forsaken, which\nthe catholic Church maintains against those very Pelagians, asserting as she does that it is original\nsin, the guilt of which, contracted by generation, must be remitted by regeneration? And if they\nconfess this with us, so that we may at once, in this matter of the Pelagians, destroy error, why do\nthey think that it must be doubted that God can deliver even infants, to whom He gives His grace by\nthe sacrament of baptism, from the power of darkness, and translate them into the kingdom of the Son\nof His love?[fn-70-P7076_2705199:57-nf] In the fact, therefore, that\nHe gives that grace to some, and does not give it to others. why will they not stag to the Lord His\nmercy and judgment?[fn-70-P7077_2705365:58-nf] Why, however, is it\ngiven to these, rather than to those,-who has known the mind of the Lord? who is able to look into\nunsearchable things? who to trace out that which is past finding out?","title":"A Treatise on the Gift of\nPerseverance, Being the Second Book","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_29_sermon_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5.

For He it is who \"as a bride-groom goeth forth from his bride-chamber; He exulted as a giant to run his way. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return unto the ends of it.\"[fn-102-P10217_3185294:88-nf] Because, even to the highest, \"not any one hath ascended into heaven save He who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-102-P10218_3185452:89-nf] Repeating this same thing, He says: \"Father, glorify me with that glory wherewith I was with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-102-P10219_3185593:90-nf] And if this Word came down from heaven as a bridegroom to the flesh, that by the assumption of flesh He might ascend thither as the Son of man, whence the Son of God had descended as the Word, reasonably, while by the mutual connection both flesh wears the Word of God, and the Son of God assumes the frailty of the flesh; when the flesh being espoused ascending thither, whence without the flesh it had descended, it at length receives that glory which in being shown to have had before the foundation of the world, it is most manifestly proved. to be God. And, nevertheless, while the world itself is said to have been founded after Him, it is found to have been created by Him; by that very divinity in Him whereby, the world was made, both His glory and His authority are proved. Moreover, if, whereas it is the property of none but God to know the secrets of the heart, Christ beholds the secrets of the heart; and if, whereas it belongs to none but God to remit sins, the same Christ remits sins; and if, whereas it is the portion of no man to come from heaven, He descended by coming from heaven; and if, whereas this word can be true of no man, \"I and the Father are one,\"[fn-102-P10220_3186818:91-nf] Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of His divinity; and if, finally, the Apostle Thomas, instructed in all the proofs and conditions of Christ's divinity, says in reply to Christ, \"My Lord and my God; \"[fn-102-P10221_3187061:92-nf] and if, besides, the Apostle Paul says, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for evermore,\"[fn-102-P10222_3187236:93-nf] writing in his epistles; and if the same apostle declares that he was ordained \"an apostle not by men, nor of man, but by Jesus Christ; \"[fn-102-P10223_3187392:94-nf] and if the same contends that he learned the Gospel not from men or by man, but received it from Jesus Christ, reasonably Christ is God. Therefore, in this respect, one of two things must needs be established. For since it is evident that all things were made by Christ, He is either before all things, since all things were by Him, and so He is justly God; or because He is man He is subsequent to all things, and justly nothing was made by Him. But we cannot say that nothing was made by Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him. He is not therefore subsequent to all things; that is, He is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since God is prior to all things. For He is before all things, because all things are by Him, while if He were only man, nothing would be by Him; or if all things were by Him, He would not be man only, because if He were only man, all things would not be by Him; nay, nothing would be by Him. What, then, do they reply? That nothing is by Him, so that He is man only? How then are all things by Him? Therefore He is not man only, but God also, since all things are by Him; so that we reasonably ought to understand that Christ is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since by Him all things were made. For how can you say that He is man only, when you see Him also in the flesh, unless because when both aspects are considered, both truths are rightly believed?","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And indeed I could set forth the treatment of this subject by all heavenly Scriptures, and set in motion, so to speak, a perfect forest of texts concerning that manifestation of the divinity of Christ, except that I have not so much undertaken to speak against this special form of heresy, as to expound the rule of truth concerning the person of Christ.

Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us, that is, assumes that man's nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man, the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with.

Who, therefore, is He that thus put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence, reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.[fn-103-P10331_3241913:177-nf] And therefore by consequence He was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another time divested of the flesh.

Whence, if indeed He is washed, He is man, because the garment which is washed is the flesh; but He who washes is the Word of God, who, in order that He might wash the garment, was made the taker-up of the garment.

This then is the third cause of affliction; and the fourth is, that the saints might not be supposed to serve God from a hope of present prosperity. For many of those who live in debauchery, when blamed as they often are by many, and invited to the labours of virtue; and when they hear the saints commended for their cheerfulness under great hardships,[fn-16-P1602_1279060:36-nf] attack their character on this ground; and not men only, but the devil himself hath taken up this suspicion. For when Job was surrounded with great wealth, and enjoyed much opulence, that wicked demon,[fn-16-P1603_1279349:37-nf] being reproached by God on his account, and having nothing to say; when he could neither answer the accusations against himself, nor impugn the virtue of this just man; took refuge at once in this defence, speaking thus, \"Doth Job fear thee for nought? Hast thou not made an hedge about him on all sides.\"[fn-16-P1604_1279875:38-nf] \"For reward then,\" saith he, \"that man is virtuous, enjoying thereby so much opulence.\" What then did God? Being desirous to show, that it was not for reward that his saints serve Him, He stripped him of all his opulence; gave him over to poverty; and permitted him to fall into grievous disease. Afterwards reproving him,[fn-16-P1605_1280235:39-nf] that he had suspected thus without cause, He saith, \"He let holdeth fast his integrity; to no purpose didst thou move me to destroy his substance.\" For it is a sufficient reward, and compensation to the saints, that they are serving God; since this indeed to the lover is reward enough, to love the object of his love;[fn-16-P1606_1280623:40-nf] and he seeks nothing besides, nor accounts anything greater than this. And if such be the case with regard to a man, much more in relation to God; which therefore that God might demonstrate, He gave more than the devil asked; for the latter said, \"Put forth thine hand, and touch him;\"[fn-16-P1607_1281102:41-nf] but God said not thus, but, \"I deliver him unto thee.\" For just as in the contests[fn-16-P1608_1281206:42-nf] of the outer world, the combatants that are vigorous, and in high condition of body,[fn-16-P1609_1281508:43-nf] are not so well discerned, when they are enwrapt all around with the garment soaked in oil; but when casting this aside, they are brought forward unclothed into the arena; then above all they strike the spectators on every side with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs, there being no longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he was enveloped in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many, what a man he was. But when, like the wrestler, that strips off his garment, he threw it aside, and came naked to the conflicts of piety, thus unclothed, he astonished all who saw him;[fn-16-P1610_1282141:44-nf] so that the very theatre of angels shouted at beholding his fortitude of soul, and applauded him as he won his crown! For, as I have already observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad in all that wealth, as when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited himself naked as it were in a theatre, in the midst of the world, and all admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only by his being stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by his patience in respect of his infirmity. And as I said before, God Himself did not smite him; in order that the devil might not again say, \"Thou hast spared him, and hast not inflicted so great a trial as was necessary:\" but he gave to the adversary the destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. \"I am sure,\" saith He, \"of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid thee to impose on him whatever struggles thou desirest.\" But as those who are well skilled in the sports of the palaestra, and have reason to rely on their art and bodily strength, often do not seize their antagonists upright, nor take an equal advantage, but suffer them to take them by the middle,[fn-16-P1611_1283421:45-nf] that they may make a more splendid conquest; so also God gave to the devil to take this saint by the waist, that when he had overcome, after an attack so greatly to his disadvantage, and stretched his adversary on the ground, his crown might be so much the more glorious!","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_38_sermon_xxi_lxxi_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"19. First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first \"gift\" is that which is concerned with the remission of sins; by which blessing \"we are delivered from the power of darkness;\"[fn-39-P3958_1709098:72-nf] and the prince of this world,[fn-39-P3959_1709145:73-nf] who worketh in the children of disobedience\"[fn-39-P3960_1709209:74-nf] by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of sin, is \"cast out\" by our faith.

They go on to state that, when the mother Achamoth had passed through all sorts of passion, and had with difficulty escaped from them, she turned herself to supplicate the light which had forsaken her, that is, Christ. He, however, having returned to the Pleroma, and being probably unwilling again to descend from it, sent forth to her the Paraclete, that is, the Saviour.[fn-62-P6255_1420667:66-nf] This being was endowed with all power by the Father, who placed everything under his authority, the Aeons[fn-62-P6256_1420908:67-nf] doing so likewise, so that \"by him were all things, visible and invisible, created, thrones, divinities, dominions.\"[fn-62-P6257_1421125:68-nf] He then was sent to her along with his contemporary angels. And they related that Achamoth, filled with reverence, at first veiled herself through modesty, but that by and by, when she had looked upon him with all his endowments, and had acquired strength from his appearance, she ran forward to meet him. He then imparted to her form as respected intelligence, and brought healing to her passions, separating them from her, but not so as to drive them out of thought altogether. For it was not possible that they should be annihilated as in the former case,[fn-62-P6258_1421702:69-nf] because they had already taken root and acquired strength [so as to possess an indestructible existence]. All that he could do was to separate them and set them apart, and then commingle and condense them, so as to transmute them from incorporeal passion into unorganized matter.[fn-62-P6259_1422137:70-nf] He then by this process conferred upon them a fitness and a nature to become concretions and corporeal structures, in order that two substances should be formed,-the one evil, resulting from the passions, and the other subject indeed to suffering, but originating from her conversion. And on this account (i.e., on account of this hypostatizing of ideal matter) they say that the Saviour virtually[fn-62-P6260_1422665:71-nf] created the world. But when Achamoth was freed from her passion, she gazed with rapture on the dazzling vision of the angels that were with him; and in her ecstasy, conceiving by them, they tell us that she brought forth new beings, partly after her oven image, and partly a spiritual progeny after the image of the Saviour's attendants.","title":"Book I","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1493,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_142_elucidations_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"ANF-06","text":"So long as we know nothing of the origin of evil, we are not competent judges of what is or is not a suitable remedy.

In spite of something illogical which seems to cling to this idea, the Get of its universal adoption in all ages among men must be accounted for,-the fact that all nations have always accepted this principle of expiatory sacrifice, innocent men and innocent beasts suffering for the unjust. Never could this principle have been thus universalized by human wisdom, for it seems to contradict reason; nor by human stupidity, for ignorance never could have proposed such a paradox; nor could priestcraft and kingcraft have obtained for it, among divers races and forms of society, with barbarians and philosophers, freemen and slaves, alike, a common acceptance.

But if it had been necessary for Him to draw the material [of His body] from another substance, the Father would at the beginning have moulded the material [of flesh] from a different substance [than from what He actually did].

O that they would consent to confess the truth from this their own statement! for if they once grant that God produces words, they plainly know Him to be a Father; and acknowledging this, let them consider that, while they are loth to ascribe one Word to God, they are imagining that He is Father of many; and while they are loth to say that there is no Word of God at all, yet they do not confess that He is the Son of God,-which is ignorance of the truth, and inexperience in divine Scripture. For if God is Father of a word at all, wherefore is not He that is begotten a Son? And again, who should be Son of God, but His Word? For there are not many words, or each would be imperfect, but one is the Word, that He only may be perfect, and because, God being one, His Image too must be one, which is the Son. For the Son of God, as may be learnt from the divine oracles themselves, is Himself the Word of God, and the Wisdom, and the Image, and the Hand, and the Power; for God's offspring is one, and of the generation from the Father these titles are tokens[fn-33-P3343_1318765:118-nf] . For if you say the Son, you have declared what is from the Father by nature; and if you think of the Word, you are thinking again of what is from Him, and what is inseparable; and, speaking of Wisdom, again you mean just as much, what is not from without, but from Him and in Him; and if you name the. Power and the Hand, again you speak of what is proper to essence; and, speaking of the Image, you signify the Son; for what else is like God but the offspring from Him? Doubtless the things, which came to be through the Word, these are `founded in Wisdom' and what are `founded in Wisdom,' these are all made by the Hand, and dame to be through the Son. And we have proof of this, not from external sources, but from the Scriptures; for God Himself says by Isaiah the Prophet; `My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spanned the heavens[fn-33-P3344_1320281:119-nf] .' And again, `And I will cover thee in the shadow of My Hand, by which I planted the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth[fn-33-P3345_1320437:120-nf] .' And David being taught this, and knowing that the Lord's Hand was nothing else than Wisdom, says in the Psalm, `In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is full of Thy creation[fn-33-P3346_1320639:121-nf] .' Solomon also received the same from God, and said, `The Lord by wisdom founded the earth[fn-33-P3347_1320751:122-nf] ,' and John, knowing that the Word was the Hand and the Wisdom, thus preached, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made[fn-33-P3348_1321040:123-nf] .' And the Apostle, seeing that the Hand and the Wisdom and the Word was nothing else than the Son, says, `God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also He made the ages[fn-33-P3349_1321391:124-nf] .' And again, `There is one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him[fn-33-P3350_1321515:125-nf] .' And knowing also that the Word, the Wisdom, the Son Himself was the Image of the Father, he says in the Epistle to the Colossians, `Giving thanks to God and the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son; in whom we have redemption, even the remission of sins; who is the Image of the Invisible God, the First-born of every creature; for by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by Him and for Him; and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist[fn-33-P3351_1322300:126-nf] .'

I am told that some among you who are catechists and teachers of the Divine Word, take the lead in this tenet, who are diametrically opposed, so to speak, to Sabellius's opinions; for he blasphemously says that the Son is the Father, and the Father the Son, but they in some sort preach three Gods, as dividing the sacred Monad into three subsistences foreign to each other and utterly separate. For it must needs be that with the God of the Universe, the Divine Word is united, and the Holy Ghost must repose[fn-34-P3430_1367654:185-nf] and habitate in God; thus in one as in a summit, I mean the God of the Universe, must the Divine Triad[fn-34-P3431_1367778:186-nf] be gathered up and brought together. For it is the doctrine of the presumptuous Marcion, to sever and divide the Divine Monarchy into three origins,-a devil's teaching, not that of Christ's true disciples and lovers of the Saviour's lessons, For they know well that a Triad is preached by divine Scripture, but that neither Old Testament nor New preaches three Gods. Equally must one censure those who hold the: Son to be a work, and consider that the Lord has come into being, as one of things which really came to be; whereas the divine oracles witness to a generation suitable to Him and becoming, but not to any fashioning or making. A blasphemy then is it, not ordinary, but even the highest, to say that the Lord is in any sort a handiwork. For if He came to be Son, once He was not; but He was always, if (that is) He be in the Father, as He says Himself, and if the Christ be Word and Wisdom and Power (which, as ye know, divine Scripture says), and these attributes be powers of God. If then the Son came into being, once these attributes were not; consequently there was a time, when God was without them; which is most absurd. And why say more on these points to you, men full of the Spirit and well aware of the absurdities which come to view from saying that the Son is a work? Not attending, as I consider, to this circumstance, the authors of this opinion have entirely missed the truth, in explaining, contrary to the sense of divine and prophetic Scripture in the passage, the words, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways unto His works[fn-34-P3432_1371004:187-nf] .' For the sense of `He created,' as ye know, is not one, for we must understand `He created' in this place, as `He set over the works made by Him,' that is, `made by the Son Himself.' And `He created' here must not be taken for `made,' for creating differs from making. `Is not He thy Father that hath bought thee? hath He not made thee and created thee[fn-34-P3433_1371382:188-nf] ?'says Moses in his great song in Deuteronomy. And one may Say to them, O reckless men, is He a work, who is `the First-born of every creature, who is born from the womb before the morning star[fn-34-P3434_1371599:189-nf] ,' who said, as Wisdom, `Before all the hills He begets me[fn-34-P3435_1371692:190-nf] ?' And in many passages of the divine oracles is the Son said to have been[fn-34-P3436_1371790:191-nf] generated, but nowhere to have[fn-34-P3437_1371841:192-nf] come into being; which manifestly convicts those of misconception about the Lord's generation, who presume to call His divine and ineffable generation a making[fn-34-P3438_1372019:193-nf] . Neither then may we divide into three Godheads the wonderful and divine Monad; nor disparage with the name of `work' the dignity and exceeding majesty of the Lord; but we must believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Christ Jesus His Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and hold that to the God of the universe the Word is united[fn-34-P3439_1372363:194-nf] .

But David said, \"The oil of the sinner,\" not of the traditor; not of him who offers incense, not of the persecutor, but \"of the sinner.\" What then will you make of your interpretation? See first whether you are not yourself a sinner. It is nothing to the point if you should say, I am not a traditor, I am not an offerer of incense, I am not a persecutor. I myself, by the grace of God, am none of these, nor is the world, which cannot be moved. But say, if you dare, I am not a sinner. For David says, \"The oil of the sinner.\" For so long as any sin, however light, be found in you, what ground have you for maintaining that you are not concerned in the expression that is used, \"The oil of the sinner\"? For I would ask whether you use the Lord's prayer in your devotions? For if you do not use that prayer, which our Lord taught His disciples for their use, where have you learned another, proportioned to your merits, as exceeding the merits of the apostles? But if you pray, as our great Master deigned to teach us, how do you say, \"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us?\" For in this petition we are not referring to those sins which have already been forgiven us in baptism. Therefore these words in the prayer either exclude you from being a petitioner to God, or else they make it manifest that you too are a sinner. Let those then come and kiss your head who have been baptized by you, whose heads have perished through your oil. But see to yourself, both what you are and what you think about yourself.

What then will they do whose heads were anointed by one guilty of a capital offense? Do not those very men kiss your heads, on whose heads you pass so serious a judgment by this interpretation which you place upon the passage? Truly I would bid you bring them forth, and admonish them to heal themselves. Or is it rather your heads which should be healed, who run so grievously astray? What then, you will ask, did David really say: Why do you ask me: rather ask himself. He answers you in the verse above: \"The righteous shall smite me in kindness, and shall reprove me; but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head.\"[fn-54-P5482_2652539:325-nf] What could be plainer? what more manifest?

Augustin answered: What you say is true. For that priesthood in the body of Christ had an anointing, and its salvation is secured by the bond of unity. For indeed Christ Himself derives His name from chrism, that is, from anointing. Him the Hebrews call the Messiah, which word is closely akin to the Phoenician language, as is the case with very many other Hebrew words, if not with almost all.[fn-54-P5489_2653937:328-nf] What then is meant by the head in that priesthood, what by the beard, what by the skirts of the garments? So far as the Lord enables me to understand, the head is none other than the Saviour of the body, of whom the apostle says, \"And He is the head of the body, the Church.\"[fn-54-P5490_2654709:329-nf] By the beard is not unsuitably understood fortitude. Therefore, on those who show themselves to be brave in His Church, and cling to the light of His countenance, to preach the truth without fear, there descends from Christ Himself, as from the head, a sacred ointment, that is to say, the sanctification of the Spirit. By the skirts of the garments we are here given to understand that which is at the top of the garments, through which the head of Him who gives the clothing enters. By this are signified those who are perfected in faith within the Church. For in the skirts is perfection. And I presume you must remember what was said to a certain rich man: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.\"[fn-54-P5491_2655530:330-nf] He indeed went away sorrowful, slighting what was perfect, choosing what was imperfect. But does it follow that there were wanting those who were so made perfect by such a surrender of earthly things, that the ointment of unity descended upon them, as from the head upon the skirts of the garments? For, putting aside the apostles, and those who were immediately associated with those leaders and teachers of the Church, whom we understand to be represented with greater dignity and more conspicuous fortitude in the beard, read in the Acts of the Apostles, and see those who \"brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet. Neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own: but they had all things common: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.\"[fn-54-P5492_2656477:331-nf] I doubt not that you are aware that it is so written. Recognize, therefore, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. Recognize the beard of Aaron; recognize the skirts of the spiritual garments. Search the Scriptures themselves, and see where those things began to be done; you will find that it was in Jerusalem. From this skirt of the garment is woven together the whole fabric of unity throughout all nations. By this the Head entered into the garment, that Christ should be clothed with all the variety of the several nations of the earth, because in this skirt of the garment appeared the actual variety of tongues. Why, therefore, is the Head itself, whence that ointment of unity descended, that is, the spiritual fragrance of brotherly love,-why, I say, is the Head itself exposed to your resistance, while it testifies and declares that \"repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem\"?[fn-54-P5493_2657487:332-nf] And by this ointment you wish the sacrament of chrism to be understood, which is indeed holy as among the class of visible signs, like baptism itself, but yet can exist even among the worst of men, wasting their life in the works of the flesh, and never destined to possess the kingdom of heaven, and having therefore nothing to do either with the beard of Aaron, or with the skirts of his garments, or with any fabric of priestly clothing. For where do you intend to place what the apostle enumerates as \"the manifest works of the flesh, which,\" he says, \"are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, poisonings, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God?\"[fn-54-P5494_2658386:333-nf] I put aside fornications, which are committed in secret; interpret uncleanness as you please, I am willing to put it aside as well. Let us put on one side also poisons, since no one is openly a compounder or giver of poisons. I put aside also heresies, since you will have it so. I am in doubt whether I ought to put aside idolatry, since the apostle classes with it covetousness, which is openly rife among you. However, setting aside all these, are there none among you lascivious, none covetous, none open in their indulgence of enmities, none fond of strife, or fond of emulation, wrathful, given to seditions, envious, drunken, wasting their time in revellings? Are none of such a character anointed among you? Do none die well known among you to be given to such things, or openly indulging in them? If you say there are none, I would have you consider whether you do not come under the description yourself, since you are manifestly telling lies in the desire for strife. But if you are yourself severed from men of this sort, not by bodily separation, but by dissimilarity of life, and if you behold with lamentation crowds like these around your altars, what shall we say, since they are anointed with holy oil, and yet, as the apostle assures us with the clearness of truth, shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Must we do such impious despite to the beard of Aaron and to the skirts of his garments, as to suppose that they are to be placed there? Far be that from us. Separate therefore the visible holy sacrament, which can exist both in the good and in the bad,-in the former for their reward, in the latter for judgment; separate it from the invisible unction of charity, which is the peculiar property of the good. Separate them, separate them, ay, and may God separate you from the party of Donatus, and call you back again into the Catholic Church, whence you were torn by them while yet a catechumen, to be bound by them in the bond of a deadly distinction. Now are ye not in the mountains of Zion, the dew of Hermon on the mountains of Zion, in whatever sense that be received by you; for you are not in the city upon a hill, which has this as its sure sign, that it cannot be hid. It is known therefore unto all nations. But the party of Donatus is unknown to the majority of nations, therefore is it not the true city.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_65_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"209","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Rightly, therefore, the divine apostle says, \"By revelation the mystery was made known to me (as I wrote before in brief, in accordance with which, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ), which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets.\"[fn-75-P7504_2265543:110-nf] For there is an instruction of the perfect, of which, writing to the Colossians, he says, \"We cease not to pray for you, and beseech that ye may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing; being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might according to the glory of His power.\"[fn-75-P7505_2265988:111-nf] And again he says, \"According to the disposition of the grace of God which is given me, that ye may fulfil the word of God; the mystery which has been hid from ages and generations, which now is manifested to His saints: to whom God wished to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations.\"[fn-75-P7506_2266331:112-nf] So that, on the one hand, then, are the mysteries which were hid till the time of the apostles, and were delivered by them as they received from the Lord, and, concealed in the Old Testament, were manifested to the saints.

Thus, if Isaiah says, `The Everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth[fn-53-P5362_2102940:75-nf] ;' and Susanna said, `O Everlasting God[fn-53-P5363_2102997:76-nf] ;' and Baruch wrote, `I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days,' and shortly after, `My hope is in the Everlasting, that He will save you, and joy is come unto me from the Holy One[fn-53-P5364_2103200:77-nf] ;' yet forasmuch as the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, `Who being the radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Person[fn-53-P5365_2103355:78-nf] ;' and David too in the eighty-ninth Psalm, `And the brightness of the Lord be upon us,' and, `In Thy Light shall we see Light[fn-53-P5366_2103498:79-nf] ,' who has so little sense as to doubt of the eternity of the Son[fn-53-P5367_2103595:80-nf] ? for when did man see light without the brightness of its radiance, that he may say of the Son, `There was once, when He was not,' or `Before His generation He was not.' And the words addressed to the Son in the hundred and forty-fourth Psalm, `Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages[fn-53-P5368_2103900:81-nf] ,' forbid any one to imagine any interval at all in which the Word did not exist. For if every interval in the ages is measured, and of all the ages the Word is King and Maker, therefore, whereas no interval at all exists prior to Him[fn-53-P5369_2104154:82-nf] , it were madness to say, `There was once when the Everlasting was not,' and `From nothing is the Son.' And whereas the Lord Himself says, `I am the Truth[fn-53-P5370_2104791:83-nf] ,' not `I became the Truth;' but always, `I am,-I am the Shepherd,-I am the Light,'-and again, `Call ye Me not, Lord and Master? and ye call Me well, for so I am,' who, hearing such language from God, and the Wisdom, and Word of the Father, speaking of Himself, will any longer hesitate about the truth, and not forthwith believe that in the phrase `I am,' is signified that the Son is eternal and without beginning?","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"20.

But the sentiment of Truth[fn-60-P6034_2406000:187-nf] in this matter must not be hidden, but must have high utterance. For the Word of God was not made for us, but rather we for Him, and `in Him all things were created[fn-60-P6035_2406185:188-nf] .' Nor for that we were weak, was He strong and made by the Father alone, that He might frame us by means of Him as an instrument; perish the thought! it is not so. For though it had seemed good to God not to make things originate, still had the Word been no less with God, and the Father in Him. At the same time, things originate could not without the Word be brought to be; hence they were made through Him,-and reasonably. For since the Word is the Son of God by nature proper to His essence, and is from Him, and in Him[fn-60-P6036_2406729:189-nf] , as He said Himself, the creatures could not have come to be, except through Him. For as the light enlightens all things by its radiance, and without its radiance nothing would be illuminated, so also the Father, as by a hand[fn-60-P6037_2406984:190-nf] , in the Word wrought all things, and without Him makes nothing. For instance, God said, as Moses relates, `Let there be light,' and `Let the waters be gathered together,' and `let the dry land appear,' and `Let Us make man[fn-60-P6038_2407840:191-nf] ;' as also Holy David in the Psalm, `He spake and they were made; He commanded and they were created[fn-60-P6039_2407982:192-nf] .' And He spoke[fn-60-P6040_2408021:193-nf] , not that, as in the case of men, some under-worker might hear, and learning the will of Him who spoke might go away and do it; for this is what is proper to creatures, but it is unseemly so to think or speak of the Word. For the Word of God is Framer and Maker, and He is the Father's Will[fn-60-P6041_2408659:194-nf] . Hence it is that divine Scripture says not that one heard and answered, as to the manner or nature of the things which He wished made; but God only said, `Let it become,' and he adds, `And it became;' for what He thought good and counselled, that forthwith the Word began to do and to finish. For when God commands others, whether the Angels, or converses with Moses, or commands Abraham, then the hearer answers; and the one says, `Whereby shall I know[fn-60-P6042_2409708:195-nf] ?' and the other, `Send some one else[fn-60-P6043_2409765:196-nf] ;' and again, `If they ask me, what is His Name, what shall I say to them[fn-60-P6044_2409858:197-nf] ?' and the Angel said to Zacharias, `Thus saith the Lord[fn-60-P6045_2409939:198-nf] ;' and he asked the Lord, `O Lord of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem?' and waits to hear good words and comfortable. For each of these has the Mediator[fn-60-P6046_2410145:199-nf] Word, and the Wisdom of God which makes known the will of the Father. But when that Word Himself works and creates, then there is no questioning and answer, for the Father is in Him and the Word in the Father; but it suffices to will, and the work is done; so that the word `He said' is a token of the will for our sake, and `It was so,' denotes the work which is done through the Word and the Wisdom, in which Wisdom also is the Will of the Father. And `God said' is explained in `the Word,' for, he says, `Thou hast made all things in Wisdom;' and `By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made fast;' and `There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him[fn-60-P6047_2410844:200-nf] .'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"45.

And, as I said before, He has not said `I am a creature,' or `I became a creature,' but only `He created[fn-61-P6161_2456467:297-nf] .' For the creatures, having a created essence, are originate, and are said to be created, and of course the creature is created: but this mere term `He created' does not necessarily signify the essence or the generation, but indicates something else as coming to pass in Him of whom it speaks, and not simply that He who is said to be created, is at once in His Nature and Essence a creature[fn-61-P6162_2458035:298-nf] .

For the Apostle did not number individually, so as to say `whether Angel, or Throne, or Dominion, or Authority,' but he mentions together all according to their kind, `whether Angels, or Archangels, or Principalities[fn-61-P6189_2470971:321-nf] :' for in this way is the origination of the creatures.

But as we, in calling the Lord Father, do not deny our servitude by nature (for we are His works, and it is `He that hath made us, and not we ourselves[fn-61-P6199_2476515:330-nf] '), so when the Son, on taking the servant's form, says, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways,' let them not deny the eternity of His Godhead, and that `in the beginning was the Word,' and `all things were made by Him,' and `in Him all things were created[fn-62-P6200_2476796:331-nf] .'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"60. And that creature and offspring are not the same, but differ from each other in nature and the signification of the words, the Lord Himself shews even in the Proverbs. For having said, `The Lord treated me a beginning of His ways;' He has added, `But before all the hills He begat me.' If then the Word were by nature and in His Essence[fn-62-P6283_2505543:398-nf] a creature, and there were no difference between offspring and creature, He would not have added, `He begat me,' but had been satisfied with `He created,' as if that term implied `He begat;' but, as it is, after saying, `He created me a beginning of His ways for His works,' He has added, not simply `begat me,' but with the connection of the conjunction `But,' as guarding thereby the term `created,' when he says, `But before all the hills He begat me.' For `begat me' succeeding in such close connection to `created me,' makes the meaning one, and shews that `created' is said with an object[fn-62-P6284_2506158:399-nf] , but that `begat me' is prior to `created me.' For as, if He had said the reverse, `The Lord begat me,' and went on, `But before the hills He created me,' `created' would certainly precede `begat,' so having said first `created,' and then added `But before all the hills He begat me,' He necessarily shews that `begat' preceded `created.' For in saying, `Before all lie begat me,' He intimates that He is other than all things; it having been shewn to be true[fn-62-P6285_2506634:400-nf] in an earlier part of this book, that no one creature was made before another, but all things originate subsisted at once together upon one and the same command[fn-62-P6286_2506816:401-nf] . Therefore neither do the words which follow `created,' also follow `begat me;' but in the case of `created' is added `beginning of ways,' but of `begat me,' He says not, `He begat me as a beginning,' but `before all He begat me.'

And I think that the irreligious men themselves will be shamed from such a thought; for if the case stands not as we have said, but they will rule it that He is `First-born of the whole creation' as in essence-a creature among creatures, let them reflect that they will be conceiving Him as brother and fellow of the things without reason and life.

How then can they say this without exceeding all measures of irreligion? or who will endure them, if this is their language? or who can but hate them even imagining such things? For it is evident to all, that neither for Himself, as being a creature, nor as having any connection according to essence with the whole creation, has He been called `First-born' of it: but because the Word, when at the beginning He framed the creatures, condescended to things originate, that it might be possible for them to come to be. For they could not have endured His nature, which was untempered splendour, even that of the Father, unless condescending by the Father's love for man He had supported them and taken hold of them and brought them into existence[fn-63-P6324_2520816:435-nf] ; and next, because, by this condescension of the Word, the creation too is made a son[fn-63-P6325_2521373:436-nf] through Him, that He might be in all respects `First-born' of it, as has been said, both in creating, and also in being brought for the sake of all into this very world.

The Word then is neither creature nor work; for creature, thing made, work, are all one; and were He creature and thing made, He would also be work. Accordingly He has not said, `He created Me a work,' nor `He made Me with the works,' lest He should appear to be in nature and essence[fn-63-P6380_2542829:484-nf] a creature; nor, `He created Me to make works,' lest, on the other hand, according to the perverseness of the irreligious, He should seem as an instrument[fn-63-P6381_2543004:485-nf] made for our sake. Nor again has He declared, `He created Me before the works,' lest, as He really is before all, as an Offspring, so, if created also before the works, He should give `Offspring' and `He created' the same meaning. But He has said with exact discrimination[fn-63-P6382_2543310:486-nf] , `for the works;' as much as to say, `The Father has made Me, into flesh, that I might be man,' which again shews that He is not a work but an offspring. For as he who comes into a house, is not part of the house, but is other than the house, so He who is created for the works, must be by nature other than the works. But if otherwise, as you hold, O Arians, the Word of God be a work, by what[fn-63-P6383_2543724:487-nf] Hand and Wisdom did He Himself come into being? for all things that came to be, came by the Hand and Wisdom of God, who Himself says, `My hand hath made all these things[fn-63-P6384_2543912:488-nf] ;' and David says in the Psalm, `And Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands[fn-63-P6385_2544080:489-nf] ;' and again, in the hundred and forty-second Psalm, `I do remember the time past, I muse upon all Thy works, yea I exercise myself in the works of Thy hands[fn-63-P6386_2544258:490-nf] .' Therefore if by the Hand of God the works are wrought, and it is written that `all things were made through the Word,' and `without Him was not made one thing[fn-63-P6387_2544442:491-nf] ,' and again, `One Lord Jesus, through whom are all things[fn-63-P6388_2544518:492-nf] ,' and `in Him all things consist[fn-63-P6389_2544575:493-nf] ,' it is very plain that the Son cannot be a work, but He is the Hand[fn-63-P6390_2544664:494-nf] of God and the Wisdom. This knowing, the martyrs in Babylon, Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, arraign the Arian irreligion. For when they say, `O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord,' they recount things in heaven, things on earth, and the whole creation, as works; but the Son they name not. For they say not, `Bless, O Word, and praise, O Wisdom;' to shew that all other things are both praising and are works; but the Word is not a work nor of those that praise, but is praised with the Father and worshipped and confessed as God[fn-63-P6391_2545220:495-nf] , being His Word and Wisdom, and of the works the Framer. This too the Spirit has declared in the Psalms with a most apposite distinction, `the Word of the Lord is true, and all His works are faithful[fn-63-P6392_2545677:496-nf] ;' as in another Psalm too He says, `O Lord, how manifold are Thy works! in Wisdom hast Thou made them all[fn-63-P6393_2545806:497-nf] .'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"12. For if there were no unity, nor the Word the own Offspring of the Father's Essence, as the radiance of the light, but the Son were divided in nature from the Father, it were sufficient that the Father alone should give, since none of originate things is a partner with his Maker in His givings; but, as it is, such a mode of giving shews the oneness of the Father and the Son. No one, for instance, would pray to receive from God and the Angels[fn-66-P6611_2623421:99-nf] , or from any other creature, nor would any one say,`May God and the Angel give thee;' but from Father and the Son, because of Their oneness and the oneness of Their giving. For through the Son is given what is given; and there is nothing but the Father operates it through the Son; for thus is grace secure to him who receives it. And if the Patriarch Jacob, blessing his grandchildren Ephraim and Manasses, said, `God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which delivered me from all evil, bless the lads[fn-66-P6612_2624677:100-nf] ,' yet none of created and natural Angels did he join to God their Creator, nor rejecting God that fed him, did he from Angel ask the blessing on his grandsons; but in saying, `Who delivered me from all evil,' he shewed that it was no created Angel, but the Word of God, whom he joined to the Father in his prayer, through whom, whomsoever He will, God doth deliver. For knowing that He is also called the Father's `Angel of great Counsel[fn-66-P6613_2625677:101-nf] ,' he said that none other than He was the Giver of blessing, and Deliverer from evil Nor was it that he desired a blessing for himself from God but for his grandchildren from the Angel, but whom He Himself had besought saying, `I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me[fn-66-P6614_2625973:102-nf] ' (for that was God, as he says himself, `I have seen God face to face'), Him he prayed to bless also the sons of Joseph. It is proper then to an Angel to minister at the command of God, and often does he go forth to cast out the Amorite, and is sent to guard the people in the way; but these are not his doings, but of God who commanded and sent him, whose also it is to deliver, whom He will deliver. There- fore it was no other than the Lord God Himself whom he had seen, who said to him, `And behold I am with thee, to guard thee in all the way whither thou[fn-66-P6615_2626575:103-nf] goest;' and it was no other than God whom lie had seen, who kept Laban from his treachery, ordering him not to speak evil words to Jacob; and none other than God did he himself beseech, saying, `Rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I fear him[fn-66-P6616_2626858:104-nf] ;' for in conversation too with his wives he said, `God hath not suffered Laban to injure me.'","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"59.

Isaiah said: \"Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils for he is reputed high.\" But John says: \"That which was from the beginning, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled.\" The former said that as man He would be persecuted by the Jews: the latter declared that as man He was handled by men's hands. The one predicted that He whom he announced as man, would be God Most High: the other asserts that He whom he showed to have been handled by men, was ever God in the beginning. It is then as clear as possible that they both showed the Lord Jesus Christ to be both God ant man; and that the same Person was afterwards man who had always been God, and thus He was God and man, because God Himself became man. That then, he says, \"which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life; and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and do bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal which was with the Father, and hath appeared unto us.\" You see the number of proofs and ways, very different and numerous, in which that Apostle so well beloved and so devoted to God, indicates the mystery of the Divine Incarnation. In the first instance he testifies that He, who ever was in the beginning, was seen in the flesh. Lest in case it might not seem sufficient for unbelievers that he had spoken of Him as seen and heard, he supports it by saying that He was handled, i.e., touched and felt by his own hands and by those of others. Admirably indeed by showing how He took flesh, does he shut out the view of the Marcionites and the error of the Manichees, so that no one may think that a phantom appeared to men, since an apostle has declared that a true body was handled by him. Then he adds \"the word of life: and the life was manifested;\" and that he saw it, announced it, and proclaimed it: thus at the same time carrying out the duties of the faith and striking the unbelievers with terror, that while he declares that he proclaims Him, he may bring home the danger in which he stands, to the man who will not listen. \"We declare to you,\" he says, \"the life eternal which was with the Father, and hath appeared to us.\" He teaches that that which was ever with the Father appeared to men: and that which was ever in the beginning, was seen of men: and that which was the Word of life without beginning, was handled by men's hands. You see the number and variety, the particularity and the clearness of the ways in which he unfolds the mystery of the flesh joined to God, in such a way that no one could speak at all of either without acknowledging both. As the Apostle himself clearly says elsewhere: \"For Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.\"[fn-72-P7218_2631592:23-nf] This is what he said in the passage given above: \"That which was from the beginning, our hands have handled.\" Not that a spirit can in its own nature be handled: but that the Word made flesh was in a sense handled in the manhood with which it was joined. And so Jesus is \"the same yesterday and to-day\": i.e., the same Person before the commencement of the world, as in the flesh; the same in the past as in the present, the same also for ever, for He is the same through all the ages, as before all the ages.

Let me then speak of it, since it is necessary, and let me put an end to my hesitation. In truth the most difficult of sciences is to know one's self. Not only our eye, from which nothing outside us escapes, cannot see itself; but our mind, so piercing to discover the sins of others, is slow to recognise its own faults.[fn-25-P2530_852196:34-nf] Thus my speech, after eagerly investigating what is external to myself, is slow and hesitating in exploring my own nature.

Where is the Jew who resisted the truth and pretended that God was speaking to Himself? It is He who spoke, it is said, and it is He who made. \"Let there be light and there was light.\" But then their words contain a manifest absurdity. Where is the smith, the carpenter, the shoemaker, who, without help and alone before the instruments of his trade, would say to himself; let us make the sword, let us put together the plough, let us make the boot? Does he not perform the work of his craft in silence? Strange folly, to say that any one has seated himself to command himself, to watch over himself, to constrain himself, to hurry himself, with the tones of a master! But the unhappy creatures are not afraid to calumniate the Lord Himself. What will they not say with a tongue so well practised in lying? Here, however, words stop their mouth; \"And God said let us make man.\" Tell me; is there then only one Person? It isnot written \"Let man be made,\" but, \"Let us make man.\" The preaching of theology remains enveloped in shadow before the appearance of him who was to be instructed, but, now, the creation of man is expected, that faith unveils herself and the dogma of truth appears in all its light. \"Let us make \"O enemy of Christ, man.Oy ofhear God speaking to His Co-operator, to Him by Whom also He made the worlds, Who upholds all things by the word of His power.[fn-25-P2534_854563:38-nf] But He does not leave the voice of true religion without answer. Thus the Jews, race hostile to truth, when they find themselves pressed, act like beasts enraged against man, who roar at the bars of their cage and show the cruelty and the ferocity of their nature, without being able to assuage their fury. God, they say, addresses Himself to several persons; it is to the angels before Him that He says, \"Let us make man.\" Jewish fiction! a fable whose frivolity shows whence it has come. To reject one person, they admit many. To reject the Son, they raise servants to the dignity of counsellors; they make of our fellow slaves the agents in our creation. The perfect man attains the dignity of an angel; but what creature can be like the Creator? Listen to the continuation. \"In our image.\" What have you to reply? Is there one image of God and the angels? Father and Son have by absolute necessity the same form, but the form is here understood as becomes the divine, not in bodily shape, but in the proper qualities of Godhead. Hear also, you who belong to the new concision[fn-25-P2535_855666:39-nf] and who, under the appearance of Christianity, strengthen the error of the Jews.[fn-25-P2536_855766:40-nf] To Whom does He say, \"in our image,\" to whom if it is not to Him who is \"the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person,\"[fn-25-P2537_855922:41-nf] \"the image of the invisible God\"?[fn-25-P2538_855972:42-nf] It is then to His living image, to Him Who has said \"I and my Father are one,\"[fn-25-P2539_856068:43-nf] \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,\"[fn-25-P2540_856130:44-nf] that God says \"Let us make man in our image.\" Where is the unlikeness[fn-25-P2541_856218:45-nf] in these Beings who have only one image? \"So God created man,\"[fn-25-P2542_856370:46-nf] It is not \"They made.\" Here Scripture avoids the plurality of the Persons.

But the others, after being deposed again and again, and once more at Ariminum itself, ventured to write that it ought not to be said that the Son had Essence or Subsistence.

And again the fathers taught at Nicaea that the Son and Word is not a creature, nor made, having read `all things were made through Him[fn-78-P7854_3146210:18-nf] ,' and `in Him were all things created, and consist[fn-78-P7855_3146278:19-nf] ;' while these men, Arians rather than Christians, in their other synods have ventured to call Him a creature, and one of the things that are made, things of which He Himself is the Artificer and Maker.

For inasmuch as the Greek word pasxhein means to suffer, therefore pascha has been supposed to mean suffering, as if the noun derived its name from His passion: but in its own language, that is, in Hebrew, pascha means passover;[fn-23-P2380_1441118:1-nf] because the pascha was then celebrated for the first time by God's people, when, in their flight from Egypt, they passed over the Red Sea.[fn-23-P2381_1441295:2-nf] And now that prophetic emblem is fulfilled in truth, when Christ is led as a sheep to the slaughter,[fn-23-P2382_1441655:3-nf] that by His blood sprinkled on our doorposts, that is, by the sign of His cross marked on our foreheads, we may be delivered from the perdition awaiting this world, as Israel from the bondage and destruction of the Egyptians;[fn-23-P2383_1441899:4-nf] and a most salutary transit we make when we pass over from the devil to Christ, and from this unstable world to His well-established kingdom.

Whence, and whither does He pass?

And what, then, of unbelievers, who stand altogether apart from this Head and His members? Do not they also pass away, seeing that they abide not here always? They also do plainly pass away: but it is one thing to pass from the world, and another to pass away with it; one thing to pass to the Father, another to pass to the enemy.

The former dared to maintain that the blessed Virgin Mary was the mother of Christ's manhood only, so that in her conception and childbearing no union might be believed to have taken place of the Word and the Flesh: because the Son of God did not Himself become Son of Man, but of His mere condescension linked Himself with created man. This can in no wise be tolerated by catholic ears, which are so imbued with the gospel of Truth that they know of a surety there is no hope of salvation for mankind unless He were Himself the Son of the Virgin who was His mother's Creator. On the other hand this blasphemous propounder of more recent profanity has confessed the union of the two Natures in Christ, but has maintained that the effect of this very union is that of the two one remained while the substance of the other no longer existed, which of course could not have been brought to an end except by either destruction or separation[fn-31-P3199_774242:14-nf] .

For if the Incarnation of the Word is the uniting of the Divine and human natures, but by the very fact of their coming together that which was twofold became single, it was only the Godhead that was born of the Virgin's womb, and went through the deceptive appearance of receiving nourishment and bodily growth: and to pass over all the changes of the human state, it was only the Godhead that was crucified, dead, and buried: so that according to those who thus think, there is no reason to hope for the resurrection, and Christ is not \"the first-begotten from the dead[fn-32-P3200_775378:15-nf] ;\" because He was not One who ought to have been raised again, if He had not been One who could be slain.","title":"Sermon XXVIII.

And as often as the name of the world is used in a bad sense, He is pointing only to the lovers of such a world; of whom it is elsewhere recorded, \"Whosoever will be a friend of this world, becomes the enemy of God.\"[fn-28-P2856_1648884:7-nf] Far be it from us, then, so to understand the devil as prince of the world, as if he wielded the government of the whole world, that is, of heaven and earth, and all that is in them; of which sort of world it was said, when we were lecturing on Christ the Word, \"And the world was made by Him.\"[fn-28-P2857_1649194:8-nf] The whole world therefore, from the highest heavens to the lowest earth, is subject to the Creator, not to the deserter; to the Redeemer, not to the destroyer; to the Deliverer, not to the enslaver; to the Teacher, not to the deceiver. And in what sense the devil is to be understood as the prince of the world, is still more clearly unfolded by the Apostle Paul, who, after saying, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood,\" that is, against men, went on to say, \"but against principalities and powers, and the world-rulers of this darkness.\"[fn-28-P2858_1649753:9-nf] For in the very next word he has explained what he meant by \"world,\" when he added, \"of this darkness;\" so that no one, by the name of the world, should understand the whole creation, of which in no sense are fallen angels the rulers. \"Of this darkness,\" he says, that is, of the lovers of this world: of whom, nevertheless, there were some elected, not from any deserving of their own, but by the grace of God, to whom he says, \"Ye were sometimes darkness; but now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-28-P2859_1650360:10-nf] For all have been under the rulers of this darkness, that is, [under the rulers] of wicked men, or darkness, as it were, in subjection to darkness: but \"thanks be to God, who hath delivered us,\" says the same apostle, \"from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.\"[fn-28-P2860_1650688:11-nf] And in Him the prince of this world, that is, of this darkness, had nothing; for neither did He come with sin as God, nor had His flesh any hereditary taint of sin in its procreation by the Virgin. And, as if it were said to Him, Why, then, dost Thou die, if Thou hast no sin to merit the punishment of death? He immediately added, \"But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do: arise, let us go hence.\" For He was sitting at table with those who were similarly occupied. But \"let us go,\" He said, and whither, but to the place where He, who had nothing in Him deserving of death, was to be delivered up to death? But He had the Father's commandment to die, as the very One of whom it had been foretold, \"Then I paid for that which I took not away;\"[fn-28-P2861_1651518:12-nf] and so appointed to pay death to the full, while owing it nothing, and to redeem us from the death that was our due.

We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, \"But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.\"[fn-31-P3112_1012024:7-nf] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God;[fn-31-P3113_1012350:8-nf] for we are taught by Holy Scripture that \"All things were made by Him,\"[fn-31-P3114_1012794:9-nf] and \"by Him consist.\"[fn-31-P3115_1012831:10-nf] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.[fn-31-P3116_1013067:11-nf] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,[fn-31-P3117_1013181:12-nf] which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_56_letter_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"8. Since then, as says the Lord in the Gospels,[fn-31-P3132_1027967:23-nf] he that hath seen the Son sees tim Father also; on this account he says that the Only-begotten is the express image of His Father's person. That this may be made still plainer I will quote also other passages of the apostle in which he calls the Son \"the image of the invisible God,\"[fn-31-P3133_1028269:24-nf] and again \"image of His goodness;\"[fn-31-P3134_1028321:25-nf] not because the image differs from the Archetype according to the definition of indivisibility and goodness, but that it may be shewn that it is the same as the prototype, even though it be different. For the idea of the image would be lost were it not to preserve throughout the plain and invariable likeness. He therefore that has perception of the beauty of the image is made perceptive of the Archetype. So he, who has, as it were mental apprehension of the form of the Son, prints the express image of the Father's hypostasis, beholding the latter in tile former, not beholding in the reflection tile unbegotten being of the Father (for thus there would be complete identity and no distinction), but gazing at tile unbegotten beauty in the Begotten. Just as he who in a polished mirror beholds the reflection of the form as plain knowledge of the represented face, so he, who has knowledge of the Son, through his knowledge of the Son receives in his heart the express image of the Father's Person. For all things that are the Father's are beheld in the Son, and all things that are the Son's are the Father's; because the whole Son is in the Father and has all the Father in Himself.[fn-31-P3135_1029734:26-nf] Thus the hypostasis of the Son becomes as it were form and face of the knowledge of the Father, and the hypostasis of the Father is known in the form of the Son, while the proper quality which is contemplated therein remains for the plain distinction of the hypostases.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
