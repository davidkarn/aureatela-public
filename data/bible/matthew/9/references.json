Now an account must be taken of the cross itself, and its meaning must be related. What the Most High Father arranged from the beginning, and how He ordained all things which were accomplished, not only the foretelling by the prophets, which preceded and was proved true[fn-16-P1606_650441:340-nf] in Christ, but also the manner of His suffering itself teaches. For whatever sufferings He underwent were not without meaning;[fn-16-P1607_650643:341-nf] but they had a figurative meaning[fn-16-P1608_650701:342-nf] and great significance, as had also those divine works which He performed, the strength and power of which had some weight indeed for the present, but also declared something for the future. Heavenly influence opened the eyes of the blind, and gave light to those who did not see; and by this deed He signified that it would come to pass that, turning to the nations which were ignorant of God, He might enlighten the breasts of the foolish with the light of wisdom, and open the eyes of their understanding to the contemplation of the truth. For they are truly blind who, not seeing heavenly things, and surrounded with the darkness of ignorance, worship earthly and frail things. He opened the ears of the deaf. It is plain that this divine power did not limit its exercise to this point;[fn-16-P1609_651508:343-nf] but He declared that it would shortly come to pass, that they who were destitute of the truth would both hear and understand the divine words of God. For you may truly call those deaf who do not hear the things which are heavenly and true, and worthy of being performed. He loosed the tongues of the dumb, so that they spake plainly.[fn-16-P1610_651871:344-nf] A power worthy of admiration,[fn-16-P1611_651928:345-nf] even when it was in operation: but there was contained in this display[fn-16-P1612_652218:346-nf] of power another meaning, which showed that it would shortly come to pass that those who were lately ignorant of heavenly things, having received the instruction of wisdom, might speak respecting God and the truth. For he who is ignorant of the divine nature, he truly is speechless and dumb, although he is the most eloquent of all men. For when the tongue has begun to speak truth-that is, to set forth the excellency and majesty of the one God-then only does it discharge the office of its nature; but as long as it speaks false things it is not rightly employed:[fn-16-P1613_652813:347-nf] and therefore he must necessarily be speechless who cannot utter divine things. He also renewed the feet of the lame to the office of walking,-a strength of divine work worthy of praise; but the figure implied this, that the errors of a worldly and wandering life being restrained, the path of truth was opened by which men might walk to attain the favour of God. For He is truly to be considered lame, who, being enwrapped in the gloom and darkness of folly, and ignorant in what direction to go, with feet liable to stumble and fall, walks in the way of death.","title":"Book IV.

Against such parties it is said, \"If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ;\"[fn-3-P314_69052:66-nf] and, by the prophet, \"They who please men are put to shame, because God hath despised them;\" and again, \"God hath broken the bones of those who please men;\"[fn-3-P315_69226:67-nf] and again the apostle, \"Let us not be desirous of vainglory;\"[fn-3-P316_69306:68-nf] and still another time, \"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.\"[fn-3-P317_69458:69-nf] Hence our Lord has not said merely, \"that they may see your good works,\" but has added, \"and glorify your Father who is in heaven:\" so that the mere fact that a man by means of good works pleases men, does not there set it up as an end that he should please men; but let him subordinate this to the praise of God, and for this reason please men, that God may be glorified in him.

What brings you, a solitary, into the throng of men? The advice that I give is that of no inexperienced mariner who has never lost either ship or cargo, and has never known a gale. Lately shipwrecked as I have been myself, my warnings to other voyagers spring from my own fears. On one side, like Charybdis, self-indulgence sucks into its vortex the soul's salvation. On the other, like Scylla, lust, with a smile on her girl's face, lures it on to wreck its chastity. The coast is savage, and the devil with a crew of pirates carries irons to fetter his captives. Be not credulous, be not over-confident.The sea may be as smooth and smiling as a pond, its quiet surface may be scarcely ruffled by a breath of air, yet sometimes its waves are as high as mountains. There is danger in its depths, the foe is lurking there. Ease your sheets, spread your sails, fasten the cross as an ensign on your prow. The calm that you speak of is itself a tempest. \"Why so?\" you will perhaps argue; \"are not all my fellow-townsmen Christians?\" Your case, I reply, is not that of others. Listen to the words of the Lord: \"If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come and follow me.\"[fn-4-P414_76063:208-nf] You have already promised to be perfect. For when you forsook the army and made yourself an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven's sake,[fn-4-P415_76218:209-nf] you did so that you might follow the perfect life. Now the perfect servant of Christ has nothing beside Christ. Or if he have anything beside Christ he is not perfect. And if he be not perfect when he has promised God to be so, his profession is a lie. But \"the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.\"[fn-4-P416_76538:210-nf] To conclude, then, if you are perfect you will not set your heart on your father's goods; and if you are not perfect you have deceived the Lord. The Gospel thunders forth its divine warning: \"Ye cannot serve two masters,\"[fn-4-P417_76780:211-nf] and does any one dare to make Christ a liar by serving at once both God and Mammon? Repeatedly does He proclaim, \"If any one will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"[fn-4-P418_77004:212-nf] If I load myself with gold can I think that I am following Christ?

On the one hand, he lays frequent stress on knowledge concerning God and concerning the nature of sin as the first conditions of salvation; on the other, he insists, less often yet with equal emphasis, upon its being God's spontaneous gift to men, to be appropriated only by faith. We have already seen that one of Hilary's positions is that man must take the first step towards God; that if we will make the beginning He will give the increase[fn-5-P576_393500:389-nf] . This increase is the knowledge of God imparted to willing minds[fn-5-P577_393743:390-nf] , which lifts them up to piety. He states strongly the superiority of knowledge to faith;-\" There is a certain greater effectiveness in knowledge than in faith. Thus the writer here did not believe; he knew[fn-5-P578_393976:391-nf] . For faith has the reward of obedience, but it has not the assurance of ascertained truth. The Apostle has indicated the breadth of the interval between the two by putting the latter in the lower place in his list of the gifts of graces. 'To the first wisdom, to the next knowledge, to the third faith ' is his message[fn-5-P579_394388:392-nf] ; for he who believes may be ignorant even while he believes, but he who has come to know is saved by his possession of knowledge from the very possibility of unbelief[fn-5-P580_394578:393-nf] .\" This high estimation of sound knowledge was due, no doubt, to the intellectual character of the Arian conflict, in which each party retorted upon the other the charge of ignorance and folly; and it must have been confirmed by the observation that some who were conspicuous for the misinterpretation of Scripture were notorious also for moral obliquity. There was, however, that deeper reason which influenced all Hilary's thought; the conviction that if there is to be any harmony, any understanding between God and the soul of man, it must be a perfect harmony and understanding. And knowledge is pre-eminently the sphere in which this is possible, for the revelation of God is clear and precise, and unmistakeable in its import[fn-5-P581_395347:394-nf] . But there was another, a directly practical reason for this insistence. Apprehension of Divine truths is the unfailing test of a Christian mind; conduct changes and faith varies in intensity, but the facts of religion remain the same, and the believer can be judged by his attitude towards them. Hence we cannot be surprised that Hilary maintains the insufficiency of 'simplicity of faith,' and ranks its advocates with heathen philosophers who regard purity of life as a substitute for religion. God, he says, has provided copious knowledge, with which we cannot dispense[fn-5-P582_395955:395-nf] . But this knowledge is to embrace not only the truth concerning God, but also concerning the realities of human life. It is to be a knowledge of the fact that sins have been committed and an opening of the eyes to their enormity[fn-5-P583_396223:396-nf] , This will be followed by confession to God, by the promise to Him that we will henceforth regard Sill as He regards it, and by the profession of a firm purpose to abandon it. Here again the starting-point is human knowledge. When the right attitude towards sin, intellectually and therefore morally, has been assumed, when there is the purpose of amendment and an earnest and successful struggle against sensual and worldly temptations, then we shall become 'worthy of the favour of God[fn-5-P584_396821:397-nf] .' In this light confession is habitually regarded[fn-5-P585_396919:398-nf] ; it is a voluntary moral act, a self-enlightenment to the realities of sin, necessarily followed by repugnance and the effort to escape, and antecedent to Divine pardon and aid. But in contrast to this,Hilary's normal judgment, there are passages where human action is put altogether in the background. Forgiveness is the spontaneous bounty of God, overflowing from the riches of His loving-kindness, and faith the condition of its bestowal and the means by which it is appropriated[fn-5-P586_397740:399-nf] . Even the Psalmist, himself perfect in all good works, prayed for mercy; he put his whole trust in God, and so must we[fn-5-P587_397895:400-nf] . And faith precedes knowledge also, which is unattainable except by the believer[fn-5-P588_398005:401-nf] . Salvation does not come first, and then faith, but through faith is the hope of salvation; the blind man believed before he saw[fn-5-P589_398155:402-nf] . Here again, as in the case of sin, we have two groups of statements without attempt at reconciliation; but that which lays stress upon human initiative is far more numerous than the other, and must be regarded as expressing Hilary's underlying thought in his exhortations to Christian conduct, to his doctrine of which we may now turn.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"17.

Them that have fled for refuge to His ruling care, and through patient endurance have mended their wayward ways,[fn-13-P1329_312563:148-nf] He calls \"sheep,\" and confesses Himself to be, to them that hear His voice and refuse to give heed to strange teaching, a \"shepherd.\" For \"my sheep, He says, \"hear my voice.\" To them that have now reached a higher stage and stand in need of righteous royalty,[fn-13-P1330_312849:149-nf] He is a King.

At one time it uses terms descriptive of His nature, for it recognises the \"name which is above every name,\"[fn-13-P1309_310901:128-nf] the name of Son,[fn-13-P1310_310942:129-nf] and speaks of true Son,[fn-13-P1311_310986:130-nf] and only begotten God,[fn-13-P1312_311195:131-nf] and Power of God,[fn-13-P1313_311254:132-nf] and Wisdom,[fn-13-P1314_311285:133-nf] and Word.[fn-13-P1315_311378:134-nf] Then again, on account of the divers manners[fn-13-P1316_311444:135-nf] wherein grace is given to us, which, because of the riches of His goodness,[fn-13-P1317_311612:136-nf] according to his manifold[fn-13-P1318_311677:137-nf] wisdom, he bestows on them that need, Scripture designates Him by innumerable other titles, calling Him Shepherd,[fn-13-P1319_311884:138-nf] King[fn-13-P1320_311910:139-nf] Physician,[fn-13-P1321_311946:140-nf] Bridegroom,[fn-13-P1322_311984:141-nf] Way,[fn-13-P1323_312016:142-nf] Door,[fn-13-P1324_312049:143-nf] Fountain,[fn-13-P1325_312085:144-nf] Bread,[fn-13-P1326_312116:145-nf] Axe,[fn-13-P1327_312145:146-nf] and Rock.[fn-13-P1328_312181:147-nf] And these, titles do not set forth His nature, but, as I have remarked, the variety of the effectual working which, out of His tender-heartedness to His own creation, according to the peculiar necessity of each, He bestows upon them that need. Them that have fled for refuge to His ruling care, and through patient endurance have mended their wayward ways,[fn-13-P1329_312563:148-nf] He calls \"sheep,\" and confesses Himself to be, to them that hear His voice and refuse to give heed to strange teaching, a \"shepherd.\" For \"my sheep, He says, \"hear my voice.\" To them that have now reached a higher stage and stand in need of righteous royalty,[fn-13-P1330_312849:149-nf] He is a King. And in that, through the straight way of His commandments, He leads men to good actions, and again because He safely shuts in all who through faith in Him betake themselves for shelter to the blessing of the higher wisdom,[fn-13-P1331_314297:150-nf] He is a Door.So He says, \"By me if any man enter in, ... he shall go in and out and shall find pastare.\"[fn-13-P1332_314618:151-nf] Again, because to the faithful He is a defence strong, unshaken, and harder to break than any bulwark, He is a Rock. Among these titles, it is when He is styled Door, or Way, that the phrase \"through Him\" is very appropriate and plain. As, however, God and Son, He is glorified with and together with[fn-13-P1333_314995:152-nf] the Father, in that \"at, the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\"[fn-13-P1334_315246:153-nf] Wherefore we use both terms, expressing by the one His own proper dignity, and by the other His grace to usward.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":9,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_07_the_dialogue_against_the_luciferians","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"15.

I pass to the Song of Songs, and whereas our opponent thinks it makes altogether for marriage, I shall show that it contains the mysteries of virginity. Let us hear what the bride says before that the bridegroom comes to earth, suffers, descends to the lower world, and rises again.[fn-63-P6358_1955785:195-nf] \"We will make for thee likenesses of gold with ornaments of silver while the king sits at his table.\" Before the Lord rose again, and the Gospel shone, the bride had not gold, but likenesses of gold. As for the silver, however, which she professes to have at the marriage, she not only had silver ornaments, but she had them in variety-in widows, in the continent, and in the married. Then the bridegroom makes answer to the bride, and teaches her that the shadow of the old law has passed away, and the truth of the Gospel has come.[fn-63-P6359_1956395:196-nf] \"Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away, for lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.\" This relates to the Old Testament. Once more he speaks of the Gospel and of virginity: \"The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the pruning of vines has come.\" Does he not seem to you to say the very same thing that the Apostle says:[fn-63-P6360_1956774:197-nf] \"The time is shortened that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none\"? And more plainly does he herald chastity:[fn-63-P6361_1956938:198-nf] \"The voice,\" he says, \"of the turtle is heard in our land.\" The turtle, the chastest of birds, always dwelling in lofty places, is a type of the Saviour. Let us read the works of naturalists and we shall find that it is the nature of the turtle-dove, if it lose its mate, not to take another; and we shall understand that second marriage is repudiated even by dumb birds. And immediately the turtle says to its fellow:[fn-63-P6362_1957378:199-nf] \"The fig tree hath put forth its green figs,\" that is, the commandments of the old law have fallen, and the blossoming vines of the Gospel give forth their fragrance Whence the Apostle also says,[fn-63-P6363_1957592:200-nf] \"We are a sweet savour of Christ.\"[fn-63-P6364_1957649:201-nf] \"Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place. Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\"[fn-63-P6365_1957917:202-nf] Whilst thou coveredst thy countenance like Moses and the veil of the law remained, I neither saw thy face, nor did I condescend to hear thy voice. I said,[fn-63-P6366_1958127:203-nf] \"Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear.\" But now with unveiled face behold my glory, and shelter thyself in the cleft and steep places of the solid rock. On hearing this the bride disclosed the mysteries of chastity:[fn-63-P6367_1958372:204-nf] \"My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth his flock among the lilies,\" that is among the pure virgin bands. Would you know what sort of a throne our true Solomon, the Prince of Peace, has, and what his attendants are like?[fn-63-P6368_1958620:205-nf] \"Behold,\" he says, \"it is the litter of Solomon: threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel. They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh.\" They who are about Solomon have their sword upon their thigh, like Ehud, the left-handed judge, who slew the fattest of foes, a man devoted to the flesh, and cut short all his pleasures.[fn-63-P6369_1959048:206-nf] \"I will get me,\" he says, \"to the mountain of myrrh;\" to those, that is, who have mortified their bodies; \"and to the hill of frankincense,\" to the crowds of pure virgins; \"and I will say to my bride, thou art all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee.\" Whence too the Apostle:[fn-63-P6370_1959352:207-nf] \"That he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.\"[fn-63-P6371_1959483:208-nf] \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon. Thou shalt come[fn-63-P6372_1959579:209-nf] and pass on from the beginning of faith, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.\" Lebanon is, being interpreted, whiteness. Come then, fairest bride, concerning whom it is elsewhere said[fn-63-P6373_1959866:210-nf] \"Who is she that cometh up, all in white?\" and pass on by way of this world, from the beginning of faith, and from Sanir, which is by interpretation, God of light, as we read in the psalm:[fn-63-P6374_1960077:211-nf] \"Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, and light unto my path;\" and \"from Hermon,\" that is, consecration: and \"flee from the lions' dens, and the mountains of the leopards who cannot change their spots.\" Flee, he says, from the lions' dens, flee from the pride of devils, that when thou hast been consecrated to me, I may be able to say unto thee:[fn-63-P6375_1960445:212-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, thou hast ravished mine heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.\" What he says is something like this-I do not reject marriage: you have a second eye, the left, which I have given to you on account of the weakness of those who cannot see the right. But I am pleased with the right eye of virginity, and if it be blinded the whole body is in darkness. And that we might not think he had in view carnal love and bodily marriage, he at once excludes this meaning by saying[fn-63-P6376_1961003:213-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my bride, my sister.\" The name sister excludes all suspicion of unhallowed love. \"How fair are thy breasts with wine,\" those breasts concerning which he had said above, My beloved is mine, and I am his: \"betwixt my breasts shall he lie,\" that is in the princely portion of the heart where the Word of God has its lodging. What wine is that which gives beauty to the breasts of the bride, and fills them with the milk of chastity? That, forsooth, of which the bridegroom goes on to speak:[fn-63-P6377_1961555:214-nf] \"I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends: yea, drink and be drunken, my brethren.\" Hence the Apostles also were said to be filled with new wine; with new, he says, not with old wine; because[fn-63-P6378_1961775:215-nf] new wine is put into fresh wine-skins, and they[fn-63-P6379_1961847:216-nf] did not walk in oldness of the letter, but in newness of the Spirit. This is wine wherewith when youths and maidens are intoxicated, they at once thirst for virginity; they are filled with the spirit of chastity, and the prophecy of Zechariah comes to pass, at least if we follow the Hebrew literally, for he prophesied concerning virgins:[fn-63-P6380_1962207:217-nf] \"And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. For what is his goodness, and what is his beauty, but the corn of the elect, and wine that giveth birth to virgins?\" They are virgins of whom it is written in the forty-fifth psalm:[fn-63-P6381_1962646:218-nf] \"The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the King's palace.\" 31. Then follows:[fn-63-P6382_1962857:219-nf] \"A garden shut up is my sister, my bride: a garden shut up, a fountain sealed.\" That which is shut up and sealed reminds us of the mother of our Lord who was a mother and a Virgin. Hence it was that no one before or after our Saviour was laid in his new tomb, hewn in the solid rock. And yet she that was ever a Virgin is the mother of many virgins. For next we read: \"Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with precious fruits.\" By pomegranates and fruits is signified the blending of all virtues in virginity.[fn-63-P6383_1963409:220-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy\"; white in virginity, ruddy in martyrdom. And because He is white and ruddy, therefore it is immediately added[fn-63-P6384_1963571:221-nf] \"His mouth is most sweet, yea, he is altogether lovely.\" The virgin bridegroom having been praised by the virgin bride, in turn praises the virgin bride, and says to her:[fn-63-P6385_1963762:222-nf] \"How beautiful are thy feet in sandals,[fn-63-P6386_1963823:223-nf] O daughter of Aminadab,\" which is, being interpreted, a people that offereth itself willingly. For virginity is voluntary, and therefore the steps of the Church in the beauty of chastity are praised.

He says: \"Heal my soul.\" Ask him how that which he wants to be healed became injured, and then listen to his following words: \"Because I have sinned against Thee.\" Let him, however, put a question, and ask what he deemed a suitable inquiry, and say: \"0 you who exclaim, Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee! pray tell me what sin is? Some substance, or wholly a name without substance, whereby is expressed, not a thing, not an existence, not some sort of a body, but merely the doing of a wrongful deed?\" Then the other returns for answer: \"It is even as you say; sin is not some substance; but under its name there is merely expressed the doing of a wrongful deed.\" But he rejoins: \"Then why cry out, Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee? How could that have possibly corrupted your soul which lacks all substance?\" Then would the other, worn out with the anguish of his wound, in order to avoid being diverted from prayer by the discussion, briefly answer and say: \"Go from me, I beseech you; rather discuss the point, if you can, with Him who said: 'They that are whole need no physician, but they that are sick; I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners,'\"[fn-20-P2007_849879:54-nf] - in which words, of course, He designated the righteous as the whole, and sinners as the sick.","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"134","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But observe how, by specious arguments, he continues to oppose the truth of Holy Scripture.

Let those, then, who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight[fn-11-P1145_618377:148-nf] , utter their groundling opinions-they who, as the prophet says, \"speak out of the ground[fn-11-P1146_618485:149-nf] .\" But let us who reverence the Word and are disciples of the Truth, or rather who profess to be so, not leave even this assertion unsifted. We know that of all the names by which Deity is indicated some are expressive of the Divine majesty, employed and understood absolutely, and some are assigned with reference to the operations over us and all creation. For when the Apostle says \"Now to the immortal, invisible, only wise Gods[fn-11-P1147_618938:150-nf] ,\" and the like, by these titles he suggests conceptions which represent to us the transcendent power, but when God is spoken of in the Scriptures as gracious, merciful, full of pity, true, good, Lord, Physician, Shepherd, Way, Bread, Fountain, King, Creator, Artificer, Protector, Who is over all and through all, Who is all in all, these and similar titles contain the declaration of the operations of the Divine loving-kindness in the creation. Those then who enquire precisely into the meaning of the term \"Almighty\" will find that it declares nothing else concerning the Divine power than that operation which controls created things and is indicated by the word \"Almighty,\" stands in a certain relation to something. For as He would not be called a Physician, save on account of the sick, nor merciful and gracious, and the like, save by reason of one who stood in need of grace and mercy, so neither would He be styled Almighty, did not all creation stand in need of one to regulate it and keep it in being. As, then, He presents Himself as a Physician to those who are in need of healing, so He is Almighty over one who has need of being ruled: and just as \"they that are whole have no need of a physician[fn-11-P1148_620178:151-nf] ,\" so it follows that we may well say that He Whose nature contains in it the principle of unerring and unwavering rectitude does not, like others, need a ruler over Him. Accordingly, when we hear the name \"Almighty,\" our conception is this, that God sustains in being all intelligible things as well as all things of a material nature. For this cause He sitteth upon the circle of the earth, for this cause He holdeth the ends of the earth in His hand, for this cause He \"meteth out leaven with the span, and measureth the waters in the hollow of His hand[fn-11-P1149_620786:152-nf] \"; for this cause He comprehendeth in Himself all the intelligible creation, that all things may remain in existence controlled by His encompassing power. Let us enquire, then, Who it is that \"worketh all in all.\" Who is He Who made all things, and without Whom no existing thing does exist? Who is He in Whom all things were created, and in Whom all things that are have their continuance? In Whom do we live and move and have our being? Who is He Who hath in Himself all that the Father hath? Does what has been said leave us any longer in ignorance of Him Who is \"God over all[fn-11-P1150_621448:153-nf] ,\" Who is so entitled by S. Paul,-our Lord Jesus Christ, Who, as He Himself says, holding in His hand \"all things that the Father hath[fn-11-P1151_621602:154-nf] ,\" assuredly grasps all things in the all-containing hollow of His hand and is sovereign over what He has grasped, and no man taketh from the hand of Him Who in His hand holdeth all things? If, then, He hath all things, and is sovereign over that which He hath, why is He Who is thus sovereign over all things something else and not Almighty? If heresy replies that the Father is sovereign over both the Son and the Holy Spirit, let them first show that the Son and the Holy Spirit are of mutable nature, and then over this mutability let them set its ruler, that by the help implanted from above, that which is so overruled may continue incapable of turning to evil. If, on the other hand, the Divine nature is incapable of evil, unchangeable, unalterable, eternally permanent, to what end does it stand in need of a ruler, controlling as it does all creation, and itself by reason of its immutability needing no ruler to control it? For this cause it is that at the name of Christ \"every knee boweth, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth[fn-11-P1152_622698:155-nf] .\" For assuredly every knee would not thus bow, did it not recognize in Christ Him Who rules it for its own salvation. But to say that the Son came into being by the goodness of the Father is nothing else than to put Him on a level with the meanest objects of creation. For what is there that did not arrive at its birth by the goodness of Him Who made it? To what is the formation of mankind ascribed? to the badness of its Maker, or to His goodness? To what do we ascribe the generation of animals, the production of plants and herbs? There is nothing that did not take its rise from the goodness of Him Who made it. A property, then, which reason discerns to be common to all things, Eunomius is so kind as to allow to the Eternal Son! But that He did not share His essence or His estate with the Father-these assertions and the rest of his verbiage I have refuted in anticipation, when dealing with his statements concerning the Father, and shown that he has hazarded them at random and without any intelligible meaning. For not even in the case of us who are born one of another is there any division of essence. The definition expressive of essence remains in its entirety in each, in him that begets and in him who is begotten, without admitting diminution in him who begets, or augmentation in him who is begotten. But to speak of division of estate or sovereignty in the case of Him Who hath all things whatsoever that the Father hath, carries with it no meaning, unless it be a demonstration of the propounder's impiety. It would therefore be superfluous to entangle oneself in such discussions, and so to prolong our treatise to an unreasonable length.

Hence another scripture says, \"For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.\"[fn-24-P2447_995121:21-nf] Since therefore \"the whole need not the physician, but only they that be sick;\"[fn-24-P2448_995221:22-nf] so likewise it is not the free that need the Deliverer, but only the enslaved. Hence the cry of joy to Him for deliverance, \"Thou hast saved my soul from the straits of necessity.\"[fn-24-P2449_995421:23-nf] For true liberty is also real health; and this would never have been lost, if the will had remained good. But because the will has sinned, the hard necessity of having sin has pursued the sinner; until his infirmity be wholly healed, and such freedom be regained, that there must needs be, on the one hand, a permanent will to live happily, and, on the other hand, a voluntary and happy necessity of living virtuously, and never sinning.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He afterwards adduces those passages which represent God as recommending His own commandments as not grievous: let us now attend to their testimony. \"Because,\" says he, \"God's commandments are not only not impossible, but they are not even grievous.

Indeed, those men who say that there is no such directing faculty, have begun by supposing that the soul itself is simply a nonentity. One Dicµarchus, a Messenian, and amongst the medical profession Andreas and Asclepiades, have thus destroyed the (soul's) directing power, by actually placing in the mind the senses, for which they claim the ruling faculty. Asclepiades rides rough-shod over us with even this argument, that very many animals, after losing those parts of their body in which the soul's principle of vitality and sensation is thought mainly to exist, still retain life in a considerable degree, as well as sensation: as in the case of flies, and wasps, and locusts, when you have cut off their heads; and of she-goats, and tortoises, and eels, when you have pulled out their hearts. (He concludes), therefore, that there is no especial principle or power of the soul; for if there were, the soul's vigour and strength could not continue when it was removed with its domiciles (or corporeal organs). However, Dicµarchus has several authorities against him-and philosophers too-Plato, Strato, Epicurus, Democritus, Empedocles, Socrates, Aristotle; whilst in opposition to Andreas and Asclepiades (may be placed their brother) physicians Herophilus, Erasistratus, Diocles, Hippocrates, and Soranus himself; and better than all others, there are our Christian authorities. We are taught by God concerning both these questions-viz. that there is a ruling power in the soul, and that it is enshrined[fn-27-P2706_907462:96-nf] in one particular recess of the body.

As Cain's sacrifice of the fruit of the ground is rejected, while Abel's sacrifice of his sheep and the fat thereof is accepted. so the faith of the New Testament praising God in the harmless service of grace is preferred to the earthly observances of the Old Testament. For though the Jews were right in practising these things, they were guilty of unbelief in not distinguishing the time of the New Testament when Christ came, from the time of the Old Testament. God said to Cain, \"If thou offerest well, yet if thou dividest not well, thou hast sinned.\"[fn-14-P1409_748774:24-nf] If Cain had obeyed God when He said, \"Be content, for to thee shall be its reference, and thou shalt rule over it,\" he would have referred his sin to himself, by taking the blame of it, and confessing it to God; and so assisted by supplies of grace, he would have ruled over his sin, instead of acting as the servant of sin in killing his innocent brother. So also the Jews, of whom all these things are a figure, if they had been content, instead of being turbulent, and had acknowledged the time of salvation through the pardon of sins by grace, and heard Christ saying, \"They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;\"[fn-14-P1410_749487:25-nf] and, \"Every one that committeth sin is the servant of sin;\" and, \"If the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed,\"[fn-14-P1411_749628:26-nf] -they would in confession have referred their sin to themselves, saying to the Physician, as it is written in the Psalm, \"I said, Lord, be merciful to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-14-P1412_749852:27-nf] And being made free by the hope of grace, they would have ruled over sin as long as it continued in their mortal body. But now, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and wishing to establish a righteousness of their own, proud of the works of the law, instead of being humbled on account of their sins, they have not been content; and in subjection to sin reigning in their mortal body, so as to make them obey it in the lusts thereof, they have stumbled on the stone of stumbling, and have been inflamed with hatred against him whose works they grieved to see accepted by God. The man who was born blind, and had been made to see, said to them, \"We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man serve Him, and do His will, him He heareth;\"[fn-14-P1413_750615:28-nf] as if he had said, God regardeth not the sacrifice of Cain, but he regards the sacrifice of Abel.

Concerning His other names, however, and especially that of Christ, what has the other side to say in reply? If the name of Christ is as common with you as is the name of God-so that as the Son of both Gods may be fitly called Christ, so each of the Fathers may be called Lord-reason will certainly be opposed to this argument. For the name of God, as being the natural designation of Deity, may be ascribed to all those beings for whom a divine nature is claimed,-as, for instance, even to idols. The apostle says: \"For there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth.\"[fn-50-P5022_1582113:211-nf] The name of Christ, however, does not arise from nature, but from dispensation;[fn-50-P5023_1582216:212-nf] and so becomes the proper name of Him to whom it accrues in consequence of the dispensation. Nor is it subject to be shared in by any other God, especially a rival, and one that has a dispensation of His own, to whom it will be also necessary that He should possess names apart from all others. For how happens it that, after they have devised different dispensations for two Gods they admit into this diversity of dispensation a community of names; whereas no proof could be more useful of two Gods being rival ones, than if there should be found coincident with their (diverse) dispensations a diversity also of names? For that is not a state of diverse qualities, which is not distinctly indicated[fn-50-P5024_1583052:213-nf] in the specific meanings[fn-50-P5025_1583097:214-nf] of their designations. Whenever these are wanting, there occurs what the Greeks call the katachresis[fn-50-P5026_1583220:215-nf] of a term, by its improper application to what does not belong to it.[fn-50-P5027_1583398:216-nf] In God, however, there ought, I suppose, to be no defect, no setting up of His dispensations by katachrestic abuse of words. Who is this god, that claims for his son names from the Creator? I say not names which do not belong to him, but ancient and well-known names, which even in this view of them would be unsuitable for a novel and unknown god. How is it, again, that he tells us that \"a piece of new cloth is not sewed on to an old garment,\" or that \"new wine is not trusted to old bottles,\"[fn-50-P5028_1583922:217-nf] when he is himself patched and clad in an old suit[fn-50-P5029_1583998:218-nf] of names? How is it he has rent off the gospel from the law, when he is wholly invested with the law,-in the name, forsooth, of Christ? What hindered his calling himself by some other name, seeing that he preached another (gospel), came from another source, and refused to take on him a real body, for the very purpose that he might not be supposed to be the Creator's Christ? Vain, however, was his unwillingness to seem to be He whose name he was willing to assume; since, even if he had been truly corporeal, he would more certainly escape being taken for the Christ of the Creator, if he had not taken on him His name. But, as it is, he rejects the substantial verity of Him whose name he has assumed, even though he should give a proof of that verity by his name. For Christ means anointed, and to be anointed is certainly an affair[fn-50-P5030_1584850:219-nf] of the body. He who had not a body, could not by any possibility have been anointed; he who could not by any possibility have been anointed, could not in any wise have been called Christ. It is a different thing (quite), if he only assumed the phantom of a name too. But how, he asks, was he to insinuate himself into being believed by the Jews, except through a name which was usual and familiar amongst them? Then 'tis a fickle and tricksty God whom you describe! To promote any plan bydeception, is the resource of either distrust or of maliciousness. Much more frank and simple was the conduct of the false prophets against the Creator, when they came in His name as their own God.[fn-50-P5031_1585551:220-nf] But I do not find that any good came of this proceeding,[fn-50-P5032_1585664:221-nf] since they were more apt to suppose either that Christ was their own, or rather was some deceiver, than that He was the Christ of the other god; and this the gospel will show.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I prefer elsewhere refuting[fn-64-P6410_1895284:1093-nf] the faults which the Marcionites find in the Creator.

He therefore said: \"You wash the outside of the cup,\" that is, the flesh, \"but you do not cleanse your inside part,\"[fn-64-P6420_1897137:1103-nf] that is, the soul; adding: \"Did not He that made the outside,\" that is, the flesh, \"also make the inward part,\" that is to say, the soul?-by which assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the cleansing of a man's external and internal nature, both alike being in the power of Him who prefers mercy not only to man's washing,[fn-64-P6421_1897504:1104-nf] but even to sacrifice.[fn-64-P6422_1897545:1105-nf] For He subjoins the command: \"Give what ye possess as alms, and all things shall be clean unto you.\"[fn-64-P6423_1897697:1106-nf] Even if another god could have enjoined mercy, he could not have done so previous to his becoming known. Furthermore, it is in this passage evident that they[fn-64-P6424_1897877:1107-nf] were not reproved concerning their God, but concerning a point of His instruction to them, when He prescribed to them figuratively the cleansing of their vessels, but really the works of merciful dispositions. In like manner, He upbraids them for tithing paltry herbs,[fn-64-P6425_1898182:1108-nf] but at the same time \"passing over hospitality[fn-64-P6426_1898249:1109-nf] and the love of God.[fn-64-P6427_1898502:1110-nf] The vocation and the love of what God, but Him by whose law of tithes they used to offer their rue and mint? For the whole point of the rebuke lay in this, that they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: \"Thou shalt love with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called thee out of Egypt.\"[fn-64-P6428_1898963:1111-nf] Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of Christ's requiring so premature-nay, as yet so distasteful[fn-64-P6429_1899096:1112-nf] -a love towards a new and recent, not to say a hardly i yet developed,[fn-64-P6430_1899184:1113-nf] deity. When, again, He upbraids those who caught at the uppermost places and the honour of public salutations, He only follows out the Creator's course,[fn-64-P6431_1899366:1114-nf] who calls ambitious persons of this character \"rulers of Sodom\"[fn-64-P6432_1899459:1115-nf] who forbids us \"to put confidence even in princes,\"[fn-64-P6433_1899532:1116-nf] and pronounces him to be altogether wretched who places his confidence in man. But whoever[fn-64-P6434_1899647:1117-nf] aims at high position, because he would glory in the officious attentions[fn-64-P6435_1899742:1118-nf] of other people, (in every such case, ) inasmuch as He forbade such attentions (in the shape) of placing hope and confidence in man, He at the same time[fn-64-P6436_1899914:1119-nf] censured all who were ambitious of high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of the law themselves, because they were \"lading men with burdens grievous to be borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own; \"[fn-64-P6437_1900176:1120-nf] but not as if He made a mock of[fn-64-P6438_1900230:1121-nf] the burdens of the law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could He have felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid them for passing over its weightier matters, alms-giving, hospitality,[fn-64-P6439_1900483:1122-nf] and the love of God? Nor, indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized), but even[fn-64-P6440_1900620:1123-nf] the tithes of rue and the cleansing of cups. But, in truth, He would rather have deemed them excusable for being unable to carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which He censures?[fn-64-P6441_1900847:1124-nf] None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling[fn-64-P6442_1901096:1125-nf] the people, loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might have the widow for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil.[fn-64-P6443_1901278:1126-nf] Of these Isaiah also says, \"Woe unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!\"[fn-64-P6444_1901389:1127-nf] and again, \"They that demand you shall rule over you.\"[fn-64-P6445_1901470:1128-nf] And who did this more than the lawyers?[fn-64-P6446_1901646:1129-nf] Now, if these offended Christ, it was as belonging to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the teachers of an alien law. But why is a \"woe\" pronounced against them for \"building the sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had killed? \"[fn-64-P6447_1901964:1130-nf] They rather deserved praise, because by such an act of piety they seemed to show that they did not allow the deeds of their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous[fn-64-P6448_1902159:1131-nf] of such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth generation? What \"key,\" indeed, was it which these lawyers had,[fn-64-P6449_1902359:1132-nf] but the interpretation of the law? Into the perception of this they neither entered themselves, even because they did not believe (for \"unless ye believe, ye shall not understand\"); nor did they permit others to enter, because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines of men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves enter in, and also shut the door against others, must He be regarded as a disparager of the law, or as a supporter of it? If a disparager, those who were hindering the law ought to have been pleased; if a supporter, He is no longer an enemy of the law.[fn-64-P6450_1902994:1133-nf] But all these imprecations He uttered in order to tarnish the Creator as a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6451_1903118:1134-nf] against whom such as offended were destined to have a \"woe.\" And who would not rather have feared to provoke a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6452_1903274:1135-nf] by withdrawing allegiance[fn-64-P6453_1903317:1136-nf] from Him?

For the whole point of the rebuke lay in this, that they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: \"Thou shalt love with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called thee out of Egypt.\"[fn-64-P6428_1898963:1111-nf] Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of Christ's requiring so premature-nay, as yet so distasteful[fn-64-P6429_1899096:1112-nf] -a love towards a new and recent, not to say a hardly i yet developed,[fn-64-P6430_1899184:1113-nf] deity. When, again, He upbraids those who caught at the uppermost places and the honour of public salutations, He only follows out the Creator's course,[fn-64-P6431_1899366:1114-nf] who calls ambitious persons of this character \"rulers of Sodom\"[fn-64-P6432_1899459:1115-nf] who forbids us \"to put confidence even in princes,\"[fn-64-P6433_1899532:1116-nf] and pronounces him to be altogether wretched who places his confidence in man. But whoever[fn-64-P6434_1899647:1117-nf] aims at high position, because he would glory in the officious attentions[fn-64-P6435_1899742:1118-nf] of other people, (in every such case, ) inasmuch as He forbade such attentions (in the shape) of placing hope and confidence in man, He at the same time[fn-64-P6436_1899914:1119-nf] censured all who were ambitious of high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of the law themselves, because they were \"lading men with burdens grievous to be borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own; \"[fn-64-P6437_1900176:1120-nf] but not as if He made a mock of[fn-64-P6438_1900230:1121-nf] the burdens of the law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could He have felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid them for passing over its weightier matters, alms-giving, hospitality,[fn-64-P6439_1900483:1122-nf] and the love of God? Nor, indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized), but even[fn-64-P6440_1900620:1123-nf] the tithes of rue and the cleansing of cups. But, in truth, He would rather have deemed them excusable for being unable to carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which He censures?[fn-64-P6441_1900847:1124-nf] None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling[fn-64-P6442_1901096:1125-nf] the people, loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might have the widow for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil.[fn-64-P6443_1901278:1126-nf] Of these Isaiah also says, \"Woe unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!\"[fn-64-P6444_1901389:1127-nf] and again, \"They that demand you shall rule over you.\"[fn-64-P6445_1901470:1128-nf] And who did this more than the lawyers?[fn-64-P6446_1901646:1129-nf] Now, if these offended Christ, it was as belonging to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the teachers of an alien law. But why is a \"woe\" pronounced against them for \"building the sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had killed? \"[fn-64-P6447_1901964:1130-nf] They rather deserved praise, because by such an act of piety they seemed to show that they did not allow the deeds of their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous[fn-64-P6448_1902159:1131-nf] of such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth generation? What \"key,\" indeed, was it which these lawyers had,[fn-64-P6449_1902359:1132-nf] but the interpretation of the law? Into the perception of this they neither entered themselves, even because they did not believe (for \"unless ye believe, ye shall not understand\"); nor did they permit others to enter, because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines of men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves enter in, and also shut the door against others, must He be regarded as a disparager of the law, or as a supporter of it? If a disparager, those who were hindering the law ought to have been pleased; if a supporter, He is no longer an enemy of the law.[fn-64-P6450_1902994:1133-nf] But all these imprecations He uttered in order to tarnish the Creator as a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6451_1903118:1134-nf] against whom such as offended were destined to have a \"woe.\" And who would not rather have feared to provoke a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6452_1903274:1135-nf] by withdrawing allegiance[fn-64-P6453_1903317:1136-nf] from Him? Therefore the more He represented the Creator to be an object of fear, the more earnestly would He teach that He ought to be served. Thus would it behove the Creator's Christ to act.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Listen, then, for a little while, and observe what is involved in this question. Catholics say that human nature was created good by the good God as Creator; but that, having been corrupted by sin, it needs the physician Christ. The Manicheans affirm, that human nature was not created by God good, and corrupted by sin; but that man was formed by the prince of eternal darkness of a mixture of two natures which had ever existed-one good and the other evil. The Pelagians and Coelestians say that human nature was created good by the good God; but that it is still so sound and healthy in infants at their birth, that they have no need at that age of Christ's medicine. Recognise, then, your name in your dogma; and cease from intruding upon the catholics, who refute you, a name and a dogma which belong to others. For truth rejects both parties-the Manicheans and yourselves. To the Manicheans it says: \"Have ye not read that He which made man at the beginning, made them male and female; and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-41-P4137_1559926:21-nf] Now Christ shows, in this passage, that God is both the Creator of man, and the uniter in marriage of husband and wife; whereas the Manicheans deny both these propositions. To you, however, He says: \"The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.\"[fn-41-P4138_1560211:22-nf] But you, admirable Christians as you are, answer Christ: \"If you came to seek and to save that which was lost, then you did not come for infants; for they were not lost, but are born in a state of salvation: go to older men; we give you a rule from your own words: `They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.'\"[fn-41-P4139_1560563:23-nf] Now, as it happens, the Manichean, who says that man has evil mixed in his nature, must wish his good soul at any rate to be saved by Christ; whereas you contend that there is in infants nothing to be sired by Christ, since they are already safe.[fn-41-P4140_1560829:24-nf] And thus the Manichean besets human nature with his detestable censure, and you with your cruel praise. For whosoever shall believe your laudation, will never bring their babes to the Saviour. Entertaining such impious views as these, of what use is it that you fearlessly face that which is enacted for you[fn-41-P4141_1561343:25-nf] in order to induce salutary fear and to treat you as a human being, and not as that poor animal of yours which was surrounded with the coloured feathers to be driven into the hunting toils? Need was that you should hold the truth, and, on account of zeal for it, have no fear; but, as things are, you evade fear in such wise that, if you feared, you would rather run away from the net of the malignant one than run into it. The reason why your catholic mother alarms you is, because she fears for both you and others from you; and if by the help of her sons who possess any authority in the State she acts with a view to make you afraid, she does so, not from cruelty, but from love. You, however; are a very brave man; and you deem it the coward's part to be afraid of men. Well then, fear God; and do not try with such obstinacy to subvert the ancient foundations of the catholic faith. Although I could even wish that spirited temper of yours would entertain some little fear of human authority, at least in the present case. I could wish, I say, that it would rather tremble through cowardice than perish through audacity.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"178","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But whatever opinion he may entertain about the shame-causing concupiscence of the flesh, I must request your attention to what he has said respecting infants (and it is in their behalf that we labour), as to their being supposed to need a Saviour, if they are not to die without salvation. I repeat his words once more: \"You assert,\" says he to me, \"that they, indeed, who have not been ever born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the world, and for whom Christ died, you decide to be the work of the devil, born in a disordered state, and guilty from the very beginning.\" Would that he only solved the entire controversy as he unties the knot of this question! For will he pretend to say that he merely spoke of adults in this passage? Why, the subject in hand is about infants, about human beings at their birth; and it is about these that he raises odium against us, because they are defined by us as guilty from the very first, because we declare them to be guilty, since Christ died for them. And why did Christ die for them if they are not guilty? It is entirely from them, yes, from them, we shall find the reason, wherefore he thought odium should be raised against me. He asks: \"How are infants guilty, for whom Christ died?\" We answer: Nay, how are infants not guilty, since Christ died for them? This dispute wants a judge to determine it. Let Christ be the Judge, and let Him tell us what is the object which has profited by His death? \"This is my blood,\" He says, \"which shall be shed[fn-43-P4390_1668446:133-nf] for many for the remission of sins.\"[fn-43-P4391_1668502:134-nf] Let the apostle, too, be His assessor in the judgment; since even in the apostle it is Christ Himself that speaks. Speaking of God the Father, he exclaims: \"He who spared. not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all!\"[fn-43-P4392_1668748:135-nf] I suppose that he describes Christ as so delivered up for us all, that infants in this matter are not separated from ourselves. But what need is there to dwell on this point, out of which even he no longer raises a contest? For the truth is, he not only confesses that Christ died even for infants, but he also reproves us out of this admission, because we say that these same infants are guilty for whom Christ died. Now, then, let the apostle, who says that Christ was delivered up for us all, also tell us why Christ was delivered up for us. \"He was delivered,\" says he, \"for our offences, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-43-P4393_1669402:136-nf] If, therefore, as even this man both confesses and professes, both admits and objects, infants, too, are included amongst those for whom Christ was delivered up; and if it was for our sins that Christ was delivered up, even infants, of course, must have original sins, for whom Christ was delivered up; He must have something in them to heal, who (as Himself affirms) is not needed as a Physician by the whole, but by the sick;[fn-43-P4394_1669850:137-nf] He must have a reason for saving them, seeing that He came into the world, as the Apostle Paul says, \"to save sinners;\"[fn-43-P4395_1669992:138-nf] He must have something in them to remit, who testifies that He shed His blood \"for the remission of sins;\"[fn-43-P4396_1670120:139-nf] He must have good reason for seeking them out, who \"came,\" as He says, \"to seek and to save that which was lost;\"[fn-43-P4397_1670257:140-nf] the Son of man must find in them something to destroy, who came for the express purpose, as the Apostle John says, \"that He might destroy the works of the devil.\"[fn-43-P4398_1670441:141-nf] Now to this salvation of infants He must be an enemy, who asserts their innocence, in such a way as to deny them the medicine which is required by the hurt and wounded.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"123","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"25.

Hereupon Matthew proceeds with his recital, still preserving the order of time, and connects his narrative in the following manner:-\"And He entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into His own city. And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed;\" and so on down to where it is said \"But when the multitude saw it, they marvelled; and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.\"[fn-17-P1701_694859:250-nf] Mark and Luke have also told the story of this paralytic. Now, as regards Matthew's stating that the Lord said,\" Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee;\" while Luke makes the address run, not as \"son,\" but as \"man,\"-this only helps to bring out the Lord's meaning more explicitly. For these sins were [thus said to be] forgiven to the \"man,\" inasmuch as the very fact that he was a man would make it impossible for him to say, \"I have not sinned;\" and at the same time, that mode of address served to indicate that He who forgave sins to man was Himself God. Mark, again, has given the same form of words as Matthew, but he has left out the terms, \"Be of good cheer.\" It is also possible, indeed, that the whole saying ran thus: \"Man, be of good cheer: son, thy sins are forgiven thee;\" or thus: \"Son, be of good cheer: man, thy sins are forgiven thee;\" or the words may have been spoken in some Other congruous order.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"171","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"59.

And he arose and followed Him.\"[fn-17-P1717_700696:262-nf] Mark gives this story also, and keeps the same order, bringing it in after the notice of the healing of the man who was sick of the palsy. His version runs thus: \"And He went forth again by the sea-side; and all the multitude resorted unto Him, and He taught them. And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me.

Luke also introduces this after the story of the healing of the same man who was sick of the palsy. He writes in these terms: \"And after these things He went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and He said unto him, Follow me. And he left all, rose up, and followed Him.\"[fn-17-P1719_701538:264-nf] Now, from this it will appear to be the most reasonable explanation to say that Matthew records these things here in the form of things previously passed over, and now brought to mind. For certainly we must believe that Matthew's calling took place before the delivery of the sermon on the mount. For Luke tells us that on this mountain on that occasion the election was made of all these twelve, whom Jesus also named apostles, out of the larger body of the disciples.[fn-17-P1720_702031:265-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"173","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"60.

Let us next look into the words which these three evangelists have all brought in as having been addressed to the Lord, and also into the replies which were made by Him. Matthew says: \"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto His disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\"[fn-17-P1728_704586:269-nf] This reappears very nearly in the same words in Mark: \"How is it that He eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?\"[fn-17-P1729_704729:270-nf] Only we find thus that Matthew has omitted one thing which Mark inserts-namely, the addition \"and drinketh.\" But of what consequence can that be, since the sense is fully given, the idea suggested being that they were partaking of a repast in company? Luke, on the other hand, seems to have recorded this scene somewhat differently. For his version proceeds thus: \"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?\"[fn-17-P1730_705239:271-nf] But his intention in this certainly is not[fn-17-P1731_705301:272-nf] to indicate that their Master was not referred to on that occasion, but to intimate that the objection was levelled against all of them together, both Himself and His disciples; the charge, however, which was to be taken to be meant both of Him and of them, being addressed directly not to Him, but to them. For the fact is that Luke himself, no less than the others, represents the Lord as making the reply, and saying, \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"[fn-17-P1732_705957:273-nf] And He would not have returned that answer to them, had not their words, \"Why do ye eat and drink?\" been directed very specially to Himself. For the same reason, Matthew and Mark have told us that the objection which was brought against Him was stated immediately to His disciples, because, when the allegation was addressed to the disciples, the charge was thereby laid all the more seriously against the Master whom these disciples were imitating and following. One and the same sense, therefore, is conveyed; and it is expressed all the better in consequence of these variations employed in some of the terms, while the matter of fact itself is left intact. In like manner we may deal with the accounts of the Lord's reply. Matthew's runs thus: \"They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; but go ye and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\"[fn-17-P1733_706922:274-nf] Mark and Luke have also preserved for us the same sense in almost the same words, with this exception, that they both fail to introduce that quotation from the prophet, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\" Luke, again, after the words, \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners,\" has added the term, \"unto repentance.\" This addition serves to bring out the sense more fully, so as to preclude any one from supposing that sinners are loved by Christ, purely for the very reason that they are sinners. For this similitude also of the sick indicates clearly what God means by the calling of sinners, -that it is like the physician with the sick,-and that its object verily is that men should be saved from their iniquity as from disease; which healing is effected by repentance.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"175","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"62. In the same way, we may subject what is said about the disciples of John to examination. Matthew's words are these: \"Then came to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft?\"[fn-17-P1735_708066:275-nf] The purport of Mark's version is similar: \"And the disciples of John and the Pharisees[fn-17-P1736_708174:276-nf] used to fast.[fn-17-P1737_708248:277-nf] And they come and say unto Him, Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees[fn-17-P1738_708448:278-nf] fast, but thy disciples fast not?\"[fn-17-P1739_708504:279-nf] The only semblance of a discrepancy that can be found here, is in the possibility of supposing that the mention of the Pharisees as having spoken along with the disciples of John is an addition of Mark's, while Matthew states only that the disciples of John expressed themselves to the above effect. But the words which were actually uttered by the parties, according to Mark's version, rather indicate that the speakers and the persons spoken of were not the same individuals. I mean, that the persons who came to Jesus were the guests who were then present, that they came because the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and that they uttered the above words with respect to these parties. In this way, the evangelist's phrase, \"they come,\" would not refer to the persons regarding whom he had just thrown in the remark, \"And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting.\" But the case would be, that as those parties were fasting, some others here, who are moved by that fact, come to Him, and put this question to Him, \"Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?\" This is more clearly expressed by Luke. For, evidently with the same idea in his mind, after stating what answer the Lord returned in the words in which He spoke about the calling of sinners under the similitude of those who are sick, he proceeds thus: \"And they said unto Him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?\"[fn-17-P1740_710063:280-nf] Here, then, we see that, as was the case with Mark, Luke has mentioned one party as speaking to this intent in relation to other parties. How comes it, therefore, that Matthew says, \"Then came to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast?\" The explanation may be, that those individuals were also present, and that all these various parties were eager to advance this charge, as they severally found opportunity. And the sentiments which sought expression on this occasion have been conveyed by the three evangelists undervaried terms, but yet without any divergence from a true statement of the fact itself.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"178","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"64. Still keeping by the order of time, Matthew next continues to the following effect: \"While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay Thy hand upon her, and she shall live;\" and so on, until we come to the words, \"and the maid arose. And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.\"[fn-17-P1748_714071:284-nf] The other two, namely, Mark and Luke, in like manner give this same account, only they do not keep by the same order now. For they bring up this narrative in a different place, and insert it in another connection; to wit, at the point where He crosses the take and returns from the country of the Gerasenes, after casting out the devils and permitting them to go into the swine. Thus Mark introduces it, after he has related what took place among the Gerasenes, in the following manner: \"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto Him: and He was nigh unto the sea. And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw Him, he fell at His feet,\" etc.[fn-17-P1749_714827:285-nf] By this, then, we are certainly to understand that the occurrence in connection with the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue did take place after Jesus had passed across the lake again in the ship.[fn-17-P1750_715050:286-nf] It does not, however, appear from the words themselves how long after that passage this thing happened. But that some time did elapse is clear. For had there not been an interval, no period would be left within which those circumstances might fall which Matthew has just related in the matter of the feast in his house. These, indeed, he has told after the fashion of the evangelists, as if they were the story of another person's doings. But they are the story really of what took place in his own case, and at his own house. And after that narrative, what follows in the immediate context is nothing else than this notice of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue. For he has constructed the whole recital in such a manner, that the mode of transition from one thing to the other has itself indicated with sufficient clearness that the words immediately, following give the narrative of what actually took place in immediate consecution. For after mentioning, in connection with the former incident, those words which Jesus spake with respect to the new cloth and the new wine, he has subjoined these other words, without any interruption in the narrative, namely, \"While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler.\" And this shows that, if the person approached Him while He was speaking these things, nothing else either done or said by Him could have intervened. In Mark's account, on the other hand, the place is quite apparent, as we have already pointed out, where other things [left unrecorded by him] might very well have come in. The case is much the same also with Luke, who, when he proceeds to follow up his version of the story of the miracle wrought among the Gerasenes, by giving his account of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, does not pass on to that in any such way as to place it in antagonism with Matthew's version, who, by his words, \"While He yet spake these things,\" gives us plainly to understand that the occurrence took place after those parables about the cloth and the wine. For when he has concluded his statement of what happened among the Gerasenes, Luke passes to the next subject in the following manner; \"And it came to pass that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received Him; for they were all waiting for Him. And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue, and he fell down at Jesus' feet,\" and so on.[fn-17-P1751_717695:287-nf] Thus we are given to understand that the crowd did indeed receive Jesus forthwith on the said occasion: for He was the person for whose return they, were waiting. But what is conveyed in the words which are directly added, \"And, behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus,\" is not to be taken to have occurred literally in immediate succession. On the contrary, the feast with the publicans, as Matthew records it, took place before that. For Matthew connects this present incident with that feast in such a way as to make it impossible for us to suppose that any other sequence of events can be the correct order.[fn-17-P1752_718339:288-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"186","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"70. As to the events next related, it is true that their exact order is not made apparent by Matthew's narrative. For after the notices of the two incidents in connection with the blind men and the dumb demoniac, he continues in the following manner: \"And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the kingdom of the gospel,[fn-17-P1776_727339:302-nf] and healing every sickness and every disease. But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion on them, because they were troubled and prostrate,[fn-17-P1777_727522:303-nf] as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth[fn-17-P1778_727738:304-nf] labourers into His harvest. And when He had called unto Him His twelve disciples, He gave them power against unclean spirits;\" and so forth, down to the words, \"Verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-17-P1779_728016:305-nf] This whole passage which we have now mentioned shows how He gave many counsels to His disciples. But whether Matthew has subjoined this section in its historical order, or has made its order dependent only on the succession in which it came up to his own mind, as has already been said, is not made apparent. Mark appears to have handled this paragraph in a succinct method, and to have entered upon its recital in the following terms: \"And He went round about the villages, teaching in their circuit:[fn-17-P1780_728545:306-nf] and He called unto Him the twelve, and began to send them by two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits;\" and so on, down to where we read, \"Shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\"[fn-17-P1781_728789:307-nf] But before narrating this incident, Mark has inserted, immediately after the story of the raising of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, an account of what took place on that occasion on which, in His own country, the people were astonished at the Lord, and asked from whence He had such wisdom and such capabilities,[fn-17-P1782_729137:308-nf] when they perceived His judgment: which account is given by Matthew after these counsels to the disciples, and after a number of other matters.[fn-17-P1783_729298:309-nf] It is uncertain, therefore, whether what thus happened in His own country has been recorded by Matthew in the succession in which it came to mind, after having been omitted at first, or whether it has been introduced by Mark in the way of an anticipation; and which of them, in short, has kept the order of actual occurrence, and which of them the order of his own recollection. Luke, again, in immediate succession to the mention of the raising of the daughter of Jaïrus to life, subjoins this paragraph, bearing on the power and the counsels given to the disciples, and that indeed with as great brevity as Mark.[fn-17-P1784_729937:310-nf] This evangelist, however, does not, any more than the others, introduce the subject in such a way as to produce the impression that it comes in also in the strictly historical order. Moreover, with regard to the names of the disciples, Luke, who gives their names in another place,[fn-17-P1785_730240:311-nf] -that is to say, in the earlier passage, where they are [represented as being] chosen on the mountain,-is not at variance in any respect with Matthew, with the exception of the single instance of the name of Judas the brother of James, whom Matthew designates Thaddaeus, although some codices also read Lebbaeus.[fn-17-P1786_730662:312-nf] But who would ever think of denying that one man may be known under two or three names?","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_30_book_xvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"1. Faustus said: You ask why we do not receive the law and the prophets, when Christ said that he came not to destroy them, but to fulfill them. Where do we learn that Jesus said this? From Matthew, who declares that he said it on the mount. In whose presence was it said? In the presence of Peter, Andrew, James, and John-only these four; for the rest, including Matthew himself, were not yet chosen. Is it not the case that one of these four-John, namely-wrote a Gospel? It is. Does he mention this saying of Jesus? No. How, then, does it happen that what is not recorded by John, who was on the mount, is recorded by Matthew, who became a follower of Christ long after He came down from the mount? In the first place, then, we must doubt whether Jesus ever said these words, since the proper witness is silent on the matter, and we have only the authority of a less trustworthy witness. But, besides this, we shall find that it is not Matthew that has imposed upon us, but some one else under his name, as is evident from the indirect style of the narrative. Thus we read: \"As Jesus passed by, He saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom, and called him; and he immediately rose up, and followed Him.\"[fn-17-P1761_995163:1-nf] No one writing of himself would say, He saw a man, and called him; and he followed Him; but, He saw me, and called me, and I followed Him. Evidently this was written not by Matthew himself, but by some one else under his name.

Shall we glut the demon of the Jews, for he is not God, with the slaughter of bulls, rams, and goats, not to say of men; and adopt, only with greater cruelty, in obedience to the law and the prophets, the practices on account of which we abandoned idolatry? Shall we, in fine, call the flesh of some animals clean, and that of others unclean, among which, according to the law and the prophets, swine's flesh has a particular defilement? Of course you will allow that as Christians we must not do any of these things, for you remember that Christ says that a man when circumcised becomes twofold a child of hell.[fn-17-P1789_1008088:1-nf] It is plain also that Christ neither observed the Sabbath himself, nor commanded it to be observed. And regarding foods, he says expressly that man is not defiled by anything that goes into his mouth, but rather by the things which come out of it.[fn-17-P1790_1008356:2-nf] Regarding sacrifices, too, he often says that God desires mercy, and not sacrifice.[fn-17-P1791_1008457:3-nf] What becomes, then, of the statement that he came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it?

Of the signs, then, by which men communicate their thoughts to one another, some relate to the sense of sight, some to that of hearing, a very few to the other senses. For, when we nod, we give no sign except to the eyes of the man to whom we wish by this sign to impart our desire. And some convey a great deal by the motion of the hands: and actors by movements of all their limbs give certain signs to the initiated, and, so to speak, address their conversation to the eyes: and the military standards and flags convey through the eyes the will of the commanders. And all these signs are as it were a kind of visible words. The signs that address themselves to the ear are, as I have said, more numerous, and for the most part consist of words. For though the bugle and the flute and the lyre frequently give not only a sweet but a significant sound, yet all these signs are very few in number compared with words. For among men words have obtained far and away the chief place as a means of indicating the thoughts of the mind.

We, on the other hand, following the suggestions of Scripture, have learnt that that nature is unnameable and unspeakable, and we say that every term either invented by the custom[fn-25-P2573_1763704:6-nf] of men, or handed down to us by the Scriptures, is indeed explanatory of our conceptions of the Divine Nature[fn-25-P2574_1763881:7-nf] , but does not include the signification of that nature itself. And it may be shown without much difficulty that this is the case. For all other terms which are used of the creation may be found, even without analysis of their origin, to be applied to the subjects accidentally, because we are content to denote the things in any way by the word applied to them so as to avoid confusion in our knowledge of the things signified. But all the terms that are employed to lead us to the knowledge of God have comprehended in them each its own meaning, and you cannot find any word among the terms especially applied to God which is without a distinct sense. Hence it is clear that by any of the terms we use the Divine nature itself is not signified, but some one of its surroundings is made known. For we say, it may be, that the Deity is incorruptible, or powerful, or whatever else we are accustomed to say of Him. But in each of these terms we find a peculiar sense, fit to be understood or asserted of the Divine nature, yet not expressing that which that nature is in its essence. For the subject, whatever it may be, is incorruptible: but our conception of incorruptibility is this,-that that which is, is not resolved into decay: so, when we say that He is incorruptible, we declare what His nature does not suffer, but we do not express what that is which does not suffer corruption. Thus, again, if we say that He is the Giver of life, though we show by that appellation what He gives, we do not by that word declare what that is which gives it. And by the same reasoning we find that all else which results from the significance involved in the names expressing the Divine attributes either forbids us to conceive what we ought not to conceive of the Divine nature, or teaches us that which we ought to conceive of it, but does not include an explanation of the nature itself. Since, then, as we perceive the varied operations of the power above us, we fashion our appellations from the several operations that are known to us, and as we recognize as one of these that operation of surveying and inspection, or, as one might call it, beholding, whereby He surveys all things and overlooks them all, discerning our thoughts, and even entering by His power of contemplation into those things which are not visible, we suppose that Godhead, or qeo/thj, is so called from qe/a, or beholding, and that He who is our qeath/j or beholder, by customary use and by the instruction of the Scriptures, is called qeo/j, or God. Now if any one admits that to behold and to discern are the same thing, and that the God Who superintends all things, both is and is called the superintender of the universe, let him consider this operation, and judge whether it belongs to one of the Persons whom we believe in the Holy Trinity, or whether the power extends[fn-25-P2575_1766840:8-nf] throughout the Three Persons. For if our interpretation of the term Godhead, or qeo/thj, is a true one, and the things which are seen are said to be beheld, or qeata/, and that which beholds them is called qeo/j, or God, no one of the Persons in the Trinity could reasonably be excluded from such an appellation on the ground of the sense involved in the word. For Scripture attributes the act of seeing equally to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. David says, \"See, O God our defender[fn-25-P2576_1767366:9-nf] \": and from this we learn that sight is a proper operation of the idea[fn-25-P2577_1767456:10-nf] of God, so far as God is conceived, since he says, \"See, O God.\" But Jesus also sees the thoughts of those who condemn Him, and questions why by His own power He pardons the sins of men? for it says, \"Jesus, seeing their thoughts[fn-25-P2578_1767728:11-nf] .\" And of the Holy Spirit also, Peter says to Ananias, \"Why hath Satan filled thine heart, to lie to the Holy Ghost?[fn-25-P2579_1767866:12-nf] \" showing that the Holy Spirit was a true witness, aware of what Ananias had dared to do in secret, and by Whom the manifestation of the secret was made to Peter. For Ananias became a thief of his own goods, secretly, as he thought, from all men, and concealing his sin: but the Holy Spirit at the same moment was in Peter, and detected his intent, dragged down as it was to avarice, and gave to Peter front Himself[fn-25-P2580_1768298:13-nf] the power of seeing the secret, while it is clear that He could not have done this had He not been able to behold hidden things.","title":"On \"Not Three Gods\"","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":9,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_28_lecture_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2.

Let them deny their association in acts, that they may be fairly able to deny also their participation in rewards. The flesh ought not to have any share in the sentence, if it had none in the cause of it. Let the soul alone be called back, if it alone went away. But (nothing of the kind ever happened); for the soul alone no more departed from life, than it ran through alone the course from which it departed-I mean this present life. Indeed, the soul alone is so far from conducting (the affairs of) life, that we do not withdraw from community with the flesh even our thoughts, however isolated they be, however unprecipitated into act by means of the flesh; since whatever is done in man's heart is done by the soul in the flesh, and with the flesh, and through the flesh. The Lord Himself, in short, when rebuking our thoughts, includes in His censures this aspect of the flesh, (man's heart), the citadel of the soul: \"Why think ye evil in your hearts? \"[fn-98-P9812_2702233:88-nf] and again: \"Whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\"[fn-98-P9813_2702368:89-nf] So that even the thought, without operation and without effect, is an act of the flesh.

The soul is never without the flesh, as long as it is in the flesh. There is nothing which the flesh does not transact in company with the soul, when without it does not exist. Consider carefully, too, whether the thoughts are not administered by the flesh, since it is through the flesh that they are distinguished and known externally. Let the soul only meditate some design, the face gives the indication-the face being the mirror of all our intentions. They may deny all combination in acts, but they cannot gainsay their co-operation in thoughts. Still they enumerate the sins of the flesh; surely, then, for its sinful conduct it must be consigned to punishment. But we, moreover, allege against them the virtues of the flesh; surely also for its virtuous conduct it deserves a future reward. Again, as it is the soul which acts and impels us in all we do, so it is the function of the flesh to render obedience. Now we are not permitted to suppose that God is either unjust or idle. Unjust, (however He would be, ) were He to exclude from reward the flesh which is associated in good works; and idle, were He to exempt it from punishment, when it has been an accomplice in evil deeds: whereas human judgment is deemed to be the more perfect, when it discovers the agents in every deed, and neither spares the guilty nor grudges the virtuous their full share of either punishment or praise with the principals who employed their services.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_36_homily_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"\"Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\"[fn-30-P3031_992446:14-nf] ","title":"Homily XXX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":9,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_36_homily_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"\"Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-30-P3039_993618:17-nf] ","title":"Homily XXX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":9,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_36_homily_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And Luke indeed affirms that the Pharisees said it, but this evangelist, that it was the disciples of John;[fn-30-P3059_998028:28-nf] but it is likely that both said it.

Our Lord, therefore, hastened to show both that she was a sinner, and that her sins were many; that the testimony of his own mouth might confute him as a liar. For he was companion of those that said: Who is able to forgive sins, but God only?[fn-37-P3752_1203960:19-nf] For from them our Lord received testimony, that, therefore, He Who is able to forgive sins, is God. Thenceforth, then, the contention was this, that our Lord should show them whether He was able to forgive sins or no. So He speedily healed the members that were visible, that it might be made sure that He had forgiven the sins that were invisible. For our Lord cast before them the word which was expected to catch him that said it; so that when they should rush forward to catch Him by it, according to their wish, they might be caught by Him according to His wish. Fear not, My son, thy sins are forgiven thee.[fn-37-P3753_1204591:20-nf] While they were hastening to catch Him on the charge of blasphemy, they pledged themselves unawares to the truth.

So their evil thoughts became unto them as bitter bonds; and that they might not free themselves from their bonds, our Lord strengthened them by giving strength to him [to whom He said] ;-Arise, take up thy bed and go into thine house.[fn-37-P3755_1205814:21-nf] For the testimony could not again be undone, as though He were not God; inasmuch as He forgave sins.

For our Lord bound up His hidden testimonies in those which were manifest; that their own testimony might choke the infidels. Accordingly our Lord made their thoughts to war against them, because they had warred with the Good One, who by His healing power warred against their diseases. For that which Simon the Pharisee imagined, and that which the scribes his companions imagined, they imagined in their hearts secretly; but our Lord spread it forth openly. Our Lord represented their hidden imaginations before them, that they might learn that His knowledge reveals and shows their secret things(;) so that though they had not recognized Him by His open signs, they might recognize Him when He represented their secret imaginations; and that if only but by this,-that He searched out their hearts,-their hearts might perceive that He was God;-that at least when they saw that their imaginations could not be hidden from Him, they might cease from imagining evil against Him. For they had imagined evil in their heart; but He exposed it openly, by this [word] Why are ye imagining evil in your heart? So that by this, that our Lord perceived their hidden imagination, they should recognize His hidden Godhead. For that Godhead, by this very thing that they in their error were reviling it, was by that reviling made known to them. For they reviled our Lord in the body, and supposed that He was not God, and cast Him down below from on high; but by the body He was made known to them as being God, by that body which was found passing to and fro amongst them. For they, by casting Him down to the depth, attempted to show this, that God Who is above, cannot in bodily wise be born below. But He by His passage up to the height, taught them this; that for the body also that is sent down below, it is not its nature to pass up to the height rather than down to the depths; so that by the body which from below passed on high upwards in the air, they might learn of God that by His grace He descended down below from on high.","title":"On Our Lord.","author":"Ephraim Syrus"},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_33_on_our_lord_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"41. Our Lord then saw that Simon the Pharisee did not believe the signs and wonders which he had seen. He came to him to persuade him with humble words; and humble utterances overcame him, whom mighty wonders had not overcome. What then are the wonders which that Pharisee had seen? He had seen the dead raised to life, the lepers cleansed, the blind with eyes opened. These signs compelled that Pharisee to entertain our Lord as a prophet. But he who entertained Him as a prophet, changed so as to despise Him for one who had not knowledge, saying (namely);-Had this man been a prophet, He would have known that this woman-who had approached Him-is a sinner. But we may despise the Pharisee and say, Had he been a man of discernment,[fn-38-P3800_1242815:45-nf] he would have learned from that sinful woman, who approached our Lord, not that He was a prophet, but the Lord of the Prophets. For the tears of the sinful woman testified, that it was not a prophet they were propitiating, but Him, Who, as God, was wroth with her sins. For, because the prophets sufficed not to raise sinners to life, the Lord of the prophets came down to heal those who were in evil case. But what physician is there who hinders the smitten, that they should not come to him, O blind Pharisee, as it befel that she came to our Physician! For why did the smitten woman approach Him,-she, whose wounds were healed by her tears? He Who had come down to be a fountain of healing amongst the diseased, was proclaiming this;-Let every one that is athirst, come and drink.[fn-38-P3801_1243618:46-nf] But when the Pharisees, this man's companions, murmured at the healing of sinners, the Physician taught concerning His art, that the door is opened for the diseased and not for the whole, for they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick.[fn-38-P3802_1243894:47-nf] Therefore the praise of the physician is the healing of the diseased;-that the shame of the Pharisee who reproved the praise of our physician may be greater. But our Lord used to show signs in the streets; and also when He entered into the house of the Pharisee, He showed signs which were greater than those He had shown outside. For in the street He made whole the bodies that were sick, but within He healed the souls that were diseased. Outside, He raised to life the mortality of Lazarus: but within, He raised to life the mortality of the sinful woman. He restored the living soul to the corpse from which it had gone out; And He expelled from the sinful woman the deadly sin which dwelt within her. But the blind (Pharisee) who was insufficient for great things, because of the great things which he saw not, belied those small things which he had seen. For he was a son of Israel who attributed weakness to his God, and not to himself. For (Israel said), Though He smote the rock and the waters flowed, can He also give us bread?[fn-38-P3803_1244954:48-nf] But when our Lord saw his weakness, that it missed the great things and, because of them, the small things also, He hasted to put forward a simple word, as though for a babe that was being reared on milk, and was not capable of solid food.","title":"On Our Lord.","author":"Ephraim Syrus"},{"chapter":9,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-10","text":" Now, to this point we have come in our discourse, because of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming together unto Jesus, who disagreed in matters relating to the resurrection, but came, as it were, to an agreement for the sake of tempting our Saviour, and asking Him to show them a sign froth heaven. For, not satisfied with the wonderful signs shown among the people in the healing of all forms of disease and sickness, and with the rest of the miracles which our Saviour had done in the knowledge of many, they wished Him to show to them also a sign from heaven. And I conjecture that they suspected that the signs upon earth might possibly not be of God; for they did not hesitate indeed to say, \"Jesus casts out demons by Beelzebub the prince of the demons; \"[fn-78-P7820_1651327:7-nf] and it seemed to them that a sign from heaven could not spring from Beelzebub or any other wicked power. But they erred in regard to both, in regard to signs upon earth as well as to signs from heaven, not being \"approved money-changers,\"[fn-78-P7821_1651592:8-nf] nor knowing how to distinguish between the spirits that are working, which kind are from God, and which have revolted from Him. And they ought to have known that even many of the portents wrought against Egypt in the time of Moses, though they were not from heaven, were clearly from God, and that the fire which fell from heaven upon the sheep of Job was not from God;[fn-78-P7822_1652103:9-nf] for that fire belonged to the same one as he to whom belonged those who carried off, and made three bands of horsemen against, the cattle of Job. I think, moreover, that in Isaiah-as if signs could be shown both from the earth and from heaven, the true being from God, but \"with all power and signs and lying wonders\"[fn-78-P7823_1652437:10-nf] those from the evil one-it was said to Ahaz, \"Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height.\"[fn-78-P7824_1652582:11-nf] For, unless there had been some signs in the depth or in the height which were not from the Lord God, this would not have been said, \"Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height.\" But I know well that such an interpretation of the passage, \"Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God,\" will seem to some one rather forced; but give heed to that which is said by the Apostle about the man of sin, the son of perdition, that, \"with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceit of unrighteousness,\"[fn-78-P7825_1653143:12-nf] he shall be manifested to them that are perishing, imitating all kinds of wonders, to-wit, those of truth. And as the enchanters and magicians of the Egyptians, as being inferior to the man of sin and the son of perdition, imitated certain powers, both the signs and wonders of truth, doing lying wonders so that the true might not be believed; so I think the man of sin will imitate signs and powers. And perhaps, also, the Pharisees suspected these things because of the prophecies concerning Him; but I inquire whether also the Sadducees tempting Him asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven. For unless we say that they suspected this, how shall we describe their relation to the portents which Jesus wrought, who continued hard-hearted and were not put to shame by the miraculous things that were done? But if any one supposes that we have given an occasion of defence to the Pharisees and Sadducees, both when they say that the demons were cast out by Jesus through Beelzebub, and when tempting Him, they ask Jesus about a heavenly sign, let him know that we plausibly say that they were drawn away to the end that they might not believe in the miracles of Jesus; but not as to deserve forgiveness; for they did not look to the words of the prophets which were being fulfilled in the acts of Jesus, which an evil power was not at all capable of imitating. But to bring back a soul which had gone out, so that it came out of the grave when already stinking and passing the fourth day,[fn-78-P7826_1654662:13-nf] was the work of no other than Him who heard the word of the Father, \"Let us make man after our image and likeness.\"[fn-78-P7827_1654804:14-nf] But also to command the winds and to make the violence of the sea cease at a word, was the work of no other than Him through whom all things, both the sea itself and the winds, have come into being. Moreover also as to the teaching which stimulates men to the love of the Creator, in harmony with the law and the prophets, and which checks passions and moulds morals according to piety, what else did it indicate to such as were able to see. than that He was truly the Son of God who wrought works so mighty?

For since the senses have a close connection with what is gross and earthy, while the intellect is in its nature of a nobler and more exalted character than the movements involved in sensation, it follows that as, through the estimate which is made by the senses, there is an erroneous judgment as to what is morally good, and this error has wrought the effect of substantiating a contrary condition, that part of us which has thus been made useless is dissolved by its reception of this contrary. Now the bearing of our illustration is as follows. We supposed that some vessel has been composed of clay, and then, for some mischief or other, filled with melted lead, which lead hardens and remains in a non-liquid state; then that the owner of the vessel recovers it, and, as he possesses the potter's art, pounds to bits the ware which held the lead, and then remoulds the vessel after its former pattern for his own special use, emptied now of the material which had been mixed with it: by a like process the maker of our vessel, now that wickedness has intermingled with our sentient part, I mean that connected with the body, will dissolve the material which has received the evil, and, re-moulding it again by the Resurrection without any admixture of the contrary matter, will recombine the elements into the vessel in its original beauty. Now since both soul and body have a common bond of fellowship in their participation of the sinful affections, there is also an analogy between the soul's and body's death. For as in regard to the flesh we pronounce the separation of the sentient life to be death, so in respect of the soul we call the departure of the real life death. While, then, as we have said before, the participation in evil observable both in soul and body is of one and the same character, for it is through both that the evil principle advances into actual working, the death of dissolution which came from that clothing of dead skins does not affect the soul. For how can that which is uncompounded be subject to dissolution? But since there is a necessity that the defilements which sin has engendered in the soul as well should be removed thence by some remedial process, the medicine which virtue supplies has, in the life that now is, been applied to the healing of such mutilations as these. If, however, the soul remains unhealed[fn-38-P3887_2564870:29-nf] , the remedy is dispensed in the life that follows this. Now in the ailments of the body there are sundry differences, some admitting of an easier, others requiring a more difficult treatment. In these last the use of the knife, or cauteries, or draughts of bitter medicines are adopted to remove the disease that has attacked the body. For the healing of the soul's sicknesses the future judgment announces something of the same kind, and this to the thoughtless sort is held out as the threat of a terrible correction[fn-38-P3888_2565732:30-nf] , in order that through fear of this painful retribution they may gain the wisdom of fleeing from wickedness: while by those of more intelligence it is believed to be a remedial process ordered by God to bring back man, His peculiar creature, to the grace of his primal condition. They who use the knife or cautery to remove certain unnatural excrescences in the body, such as wens or warts, do not bring to the person they are serving a method of healing that is painless, though certainly they apply the knife without any intention of injuring the patient. In like manner whatever material excrescences are hardening on our souls, that have been sensualized by fellowship with the body's affections, are, in the day of the judgment[fn-38-P3889_2566915:31-nf] , as it were cut and scraped away by the ineffable wisdom and power of Him Who, as the Gospel says, \"healeth those that are sick[fn-38-P3890_2567147:32-nf] .\" For, as He says again, \"they that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick[fn-38-P3891_2567271:33-nf] .\" Since, then, there has been inbred in the soul a strong natural tendency to evil, it must suffer, just as the excision of a wart[fn-38-P3892_2567424:34-nf] gives a sharp pain to the skin of the body; for whatever contrary to the nature has been inbred in the nature attaches itself to the subject in a certain union of feeling, and hence there is produced an abnormal intermixture of our own with an alien quality, so that the feelings, when the separation from this abnormal growth comes, are hurt and lacerated. Thus when the soul pines and melts away under the correction of its sins, as prophecy somewhere tells us[fn-38-P3893_2568447:35-nf] , there necessarily follow, from its deep and intimate connection with evil, certain unspeakable and inexpressible pangs, the description of which is as difficult to render as is that of the nature of those good things which are the subjects of our hope. For neither the one nor the other is capable of being expressed in words, or brought within reach of the understanding. If, then, any one looks to the ultimate aim of the Wisdom of Him Who directs the economy of the universe, he would be very unreasonable and narrow-minded to call the Maker of man the Author of evil; or to say that He is ignorant of the future, or that, if He knows it and has made him, He is not uninfluenced by the impulse to what is bad. He knew what was going to be, yet did not prevent the tendency towards that which actually happened. That humanity, indeed, would be diverted from the good, could not be unknown to Him Who grasps all things by His power of foresight, and Whose eyes behold the coming equally with the past events. As, then, He had in sight the perversion, so He devised man's recall to good. Accordingly, which was the better way?-never to have brought our nature into existence at all, since He foresaw that the being about to be created would fall away from that which is morally beautiful; or to bring him back by repentance, and restore his diseased nature to its original beauty? But, because of the pains and sufferings of the body which are the necessary accidents of its unstable nature, to call God on that account the Maker of evil, or to think that He is not the Creator of man at all, in hopes thereby to prevent the supposition of His being the Author of what gives us pain,-all this is an instance of that extreme narrow-mindedness which is the mark of those who judge of moral good and moral evil by mere sensation. Such persons do not understand that that only is intrinsically good which sensation does not reach, and that the only evil is estrangement from the good. But to make pains and pleasures the criterion of what is morally good and the contrary, is a characteristic of the unreasoning nature of creatures in whom, from their want of mind and understanding, the apprehension of real goodness has no place. That man is the work of God, created morally noble and for the noblest destiny, is evident not only from what has been said, but from a vast number of other proofs; which, because they are so many, we shall here omit. But when we call God the Maker of man we do not forget how carefully at the outset[fn-38-P3894_2571116:36-nf] we defined our position against the Greeks. It was there shown that the Word of God is a substantial and personified being, Himself both God and the Word; Who has embraced in Himself all creative power, or rather Who is very power with an impulse to all good; Who works out effectually whatever He wills by having a power concurrent with His will; Whose will and work is the life of all things that exist; by Whom, too, man was brought into being and adorned with the highest excellences after the fashion of Deity. But since that alone is unchangeable in its nature which does not derive its origin through creation, while whatever by the uncreated being is brought into existence out of what was nonexistent, from the very first moment that it begins to be, is ever passing through change, and if it acts according to its nature the change is ever to the better, but if it be diverted from the straight path, then a movement to the contrary succeeds,-since, I say, man was thus conditioned, and in him the changeable element in his nature had slipped aside to the exact contrary, so that this departure from the good introduced in its train every form of evil to match the good (as, for instance, on the defection of life there was brought in the antagonism of death; on the deprivation of light darkness supervened; in the absence of virtue vice arose in its place, and against every form of good might be reckoned a like number of opposite evils), by whom, I ask, was man, fallen by his recklessness into this and the like evil state (for it was not possible for him to retain even his prudence when he had estranged himself from prudence, or to take any wise counsel when he had severed himself from wisdom),-by whom was man to be recalled to the grace of his original state? To whom belonged the restoration of the fallen one, the recovery of the lost, the leading back the wanderer by the hand? To whom else than entirely to Him Who is the the Lord of his nature? For Him only Who at the first had given the life was it possible, or fitting, to recover it when lost. This is what we are taught and learn from the Revelation of the truth, that God in the beginning made man and saved him when he had fallen.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":9,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_42_homily_xxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Now if he had said, \"Go ye away unto Him, He is better than I,\" he would not have persuaded them, minded as they were not easily to be separated from him, but rather he would have been thought to say it out of modesty, and they would have been the more rivetted to him; or if he had held his peace, then again nothing was gained.

This is the eternal adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the eternal light, since like loves like; and that which is holy, loves that from which holiness proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light. \"Once ye were darkness, now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-33-P3386_1015287:56-nf] Hence I am of opinion man was called by the ancientsfw/j.[fn-33-P3387_1015361:57-nf] But he has not yet received, say they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is in the light, and the darkness comprehendeth him not. There is nothing intermediate between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till the resurrection of those who believe; and it is not the reception of some other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For we do not say that both take place together at the same time-both the arrival at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For eternity and time are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result; but both have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person is concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in time; the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for eternity. Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality of salvation, when He said: \"For this is the will of my Father, that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.\"[fn-33-P3388_1016450:58-nf] As far as possible in this world, which is what he means by the last day, and which is preserved till the time that it shall end, we believe that we are made perfect. Wherefore He says, \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.\"[fn-33-P3389_1016708:59-nf] If, then, those who have believed have life, what remains beyond the possession of eternal life? Nothing is wanting to faith, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If aught is wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But faith is not lame in any respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who have believed, and received without distinction the earnest of future good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by faith that which is future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that that may be fulfilled which was spoken, \"Be it according to thy faith.\"[fn-33-P3390_1017328:60-nf] And where faith is, there is the promise; and the consummation of the promise is rest. So that in illumination what we receive is knowledge, and the end of knowledge is rest-the last thing conceived as the object of aspiration. As, then, inexperience comes to an end by experience, and perplexity by finding a clear outlet, so by illumination must darkness disappear. The darkness is ignorance, through which we fall into sins, purblind as to the truth. Knowledge, then, is the illumination we receive, which makes ignorance disappear, and endows us with clear vision. Further, the abandonment of what is bad is the adopting[fn-33-P3391_1017972:61-nf] of what is better. For what ignorance has bound ill, is by knowledge loosed well; those bonds are with all speed slackened by human faith and divine grace, our transgressions being taken away by one Poeonian[fn-33-P3392_1018257:62-nf] medicine, the baptism of the Word. We are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil. This is the one grace of illumination, that our characters are not the same as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear, we who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the Holy Spirit. For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity, and that there is the same equality before the righteous and loving God, and the same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most clearly showed, speaking to the following effect: \"Before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed, so that the law became our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-33-P3393_1019327:63-nf] Do you not hear that we are no longer under that law which was accompanied with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: \"For ye are all the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-33-P3394_1020084:64-nf] There are not, then, in the same Word some \"illuminated (gnostics); and some animal (or natural) men; \"but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: \"For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup.\"[fn-33-P3395_1020475:65-nf] Nor were it absurd to employ the expressions of those who call the reminiscence of better things the filtration of the spirit, understanding by filtration the separation of what is baser, that results from the reminiscence of what is better. There follows of necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of what is better, repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess that the spirit in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way, therefore, we also, repenting of our sins, renouncing our iniquities, purified by baptism, speed back to the eternal light, children to the Father. Jesus therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: \"I thank Thee, O Father, God of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; \"[fn-33-P3396_1021288:66-nf] the Master and Teacher applying the name babes to us, who are readier to embrace salvation than the wise in the world, who, thinking themselves wise, are inflated with pride. And He exclaims in exultation and exceeding joy, as if lisping with the children, \"Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\"[fn-33-P3397_1021617:67-nf] Wherefore those things which have been concealed from the wise and prudent of this present world have been revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of God, who have put aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of wickedness, and put on the immortality of Christ; that we may become a new, holy people by regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as God's little one,[fn-33-P3398_1022035:68-nf] is cleansed from fornication and wickedness. With the greatest clearness the blessed Paul has solved for us this question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, writing thus: \"Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be children, but in understanding be men.\"[fn-33-P3399_1022507:69-nf] And the expression, \"When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spoke as a child,\"[fn-34-P3400_1022612:70-nf] points out his mode of life according to the law, according to which, thinking childish things, he persecuted, and speaking childish things he blasphemed the Word, not as having yet attained to the simplicity of childhood, but as being in its folly; for the wordnh/pion has two meanings.[fn-34-P3401_1022993:71-nf] \"When I became a man,\" again Paul says, \"I put away childish things.\"[fn-34-P3402_1023129:72-nf] It is not incomplete size of stature, nor a definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings in things that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends it, as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name \"children\" to those who are under the law, who are terrified by fear as children are by bugbears; and \"men\" to us who are obedient to the Word and masters of ourselves, who have believed, and are saved by voluntary choice, and are rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the apostle himself shall testify, calling as he does the Jews heirs according to the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise: Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors, till the time appointed by the father. So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when the fulness of the time was came, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons \"[fn-34-P3403_1024335:73-nf] by Him. See how He has admitted those to be children who are under fear and sins; but has conferred manhood on those who are under faith, by calling them sons, in contradistinction from the children that are under the law: \"For thou art no more a servant,\" he says, \"but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.\"[fn-34-P3404_1024673:74-nf] What, then, is lacking to the son after inheritance? Wherefore the expression, \"When I was a child,\" may be elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew (for he was a Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I followed the law; but after becoming a man, I no longer entertain the sentiments of a child, that is, of the law, but of a man, that is, of Christ, whom alone the Scripture calls man, as we have said before. \"I put away childish things.\" But the childhood which is in Christ is maturity, as compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must defend our childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the apostle: \"I have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with meat; for ye were not able, neither yet are ye now able.\"[fn-34-P3405_1025462:75-nf] For it does not appear to me that the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for I shall oppose to it also that Scripture, \"I will bring you into that good land which flows with milk and honey.\"[fn-34-P3406_1025683:76-nf] A very great difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these Scriptures, when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized by the milk is the beginning of faith in Christ, then it is disparaged as childish and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat, the rest of the man who is perfect and endowed with knowledge, again distinguished by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a parable, mean something like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat to the following effect: \"I have fed you with milk in Christ; \"and after a slight stop, let us add, \"as children,\" that by separating the words in reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have instructed you in Christ with simple, true, and natural nourishment,-namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing substance of milk swelling out from breasts of love. So that the whole matter may be conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of Christ, instilling into you spiritual nutriment.","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":9,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_49_homily_xliii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"3.

It is manifest to us all who possess the Gospel narratives, which Celsus does not appear even to have read, that Jesus selected twelve apostles, and that of these Matthew alone was a tax-gatherer; that when he calls them indiscriminately sailors, he probably means James and John, because they left their ship and their father Zebedee, and followed Jesus; for Peter and his brother Andrew, who employed a net to gain their necessary subsistence, must be classed not as sailors, but as the Scripture describes them, as fishermen. The Lebes[fn-79-P7940_1919782:115-nf] also, who was a follower of Jesus, may have been a tax-gatherer; but he was not of the number of the apostles, except according to a statement in one of the copies of Mark's Gospel.[fn-79-P7941_1919979:116-nf] And we have not ascertained the employments of the remaining disciples, by which they earned their livelihood before becoming disciples of Jesus. I assert, therefore, in answer to such statements as the above, that it is clear to all who are able to institute an intelligent and candid examination into the history of the apostles of Jesus, that it was by help of a divine power that these men taught Christianity, and succeeded in leading others to embrace the word of God. For it was not any power of speaking, or any orderly arrangement of their message, according to the arts of Grecian dialectics or rhetoric, which was in them the effective cause of converting their hearers. Nay, I am of opinion that if Jesus had selected some individuals who were wise according to the apprehension of the multitude, and who were fitted both to think and speak so as to please them, and had used such as the ministers of His doctrine, He would most justly have been suspected of employing artifices, like those philosophers who are the leaders of certain sects, and consequently the promise respecting the divinity of His doctrine would not have manifested itself; for had the doctrine and the preaching consisted in the persuasive utterance and arrangement of words, then faith also, like that of the philosophers of the world in their opinions, would have been through the wisdom of men, and not through the power of God. Now, who is there on seeing fishermen and tax-gatherers, who had not acquired even the merest elements of learning (as the Gospel relates of them, and in respect to which Celsus believes that they speak the truth, inasmuch as it is their own ignorance which they record), discoursing boldly not only among the Jews of faith in Jesus, but also preaching Him with success among other nations, would not inquire whence they derived this power of persuasion, as theirs was certainly not the common method followed by the multitude? And who would not say that the promise, \"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men,\"[fn-79-P7942_1922053:117-nf] had been accomplished by Jesus in the history of His apostles by a sort of divine power? And to this also, Paul, referring in terms of commendation, as we have stated a little above, says: \"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\"[fn-79-P7943_1922470:118-nf] For, according to the predictions in the prophets, foretelling the preaching of the Gospel, \"the Lord gave the word in great power to them who preached it, even the King of the powers of the Beloved,\"[fn-79-P7944_1922699:119-nf] in order that the prophecy might be fulfilled which said, \"His words shall run very swiftly.\"[fn-79-P7945_1922831:120-nf] And we see that \"the voice of the apostles of Jesus has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world,\"[fn-79-P7946_1922983:121-nf] On this account are they who hear the word powerfully proclaimed filled with power, which they manifest both by their dispositions and their lives, and by struggling even to death on behalf of the truth; while some are altogether empty, although they profess to believe in God through Jesus, inasmuch as, not possessing any divine power, they have the appearance only of being converted to the word of God. And although I have previously mentioned a Gospel declaration uttered by the Saviour, I shall nevertheless quote it again, as appropriate to the present occasion, as it confirms both the divine manifestation of our Saviour's foreknowledge regarding the preaching of His Gospel, and the power of His word, which without the aid of teachers gains the mastery over those who yield their assent to persuasion accompanied with divine power; and the words of Jesus referred to are, \"The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.\"[fn-79-P7947_1924035:122-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":9,"verse":37,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-02","text":"In the same way, therefore, those who take part in the divine words, ought to guard against betaking themselves to this, as they would to the building of cities, to examine them out of curiosity; that they do not come to the task for the sake of receiving worldly things, having ascertained that they who are consecrated to Christ are given to communicate the necessaries of life.

But certainly unless we understand that there was some sin which they would not have had if Christ had not come and spoken unto them, we must say that the proposition was false, which God forbid. He doth not say then, \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had had no sin;\" lest the Truth should lie. Nor again did He say definitely, \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had some certain sin;\" lest our devout earnestness[fn-39-P3905_1691765:27-nf] should not be exercised. For in the full abundance of the Holy Scriptures we feed upon the plain parts, we are exercised by the obscure: by the one, hunger is driven away, and daintiness[fn-39-P3906_1691966:28-nf] by the other.

But yet because it is said,\" If I had not come, they had not had sin;\" it must needs be that they contracted, though not all, yet some sin which they had not before, from the coming of the Lord. And this verily is that sin, that they believed not in Him who was present with and spake to them, and that counting Him as an enemy because He spake the truth, they put Him besides to death. This sin so great and terrible it is clear they had not had if He had not come and spoken to them. As then when we hear the words, \"They had not had sin;\" we do not understand all, but some, sin; so when we hear in to-day's lesson, \"Blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;\" we understand not all, but a certain kind of blasphemy; and when we hear, \"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him;\" we ought not to understand every, but some certain word.","title":"Sermon XXI.

For, brethren, ye heard just now when the Gospel was read, at least if ye had for it the ear not only of the body but also of the heart. What said it? \"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them.\"[fn-44-P4492_2423278:3-nf] Did He mean to say this, that whatever good things we do, we should hide them from the eyes of men,[fn-44-P4493_2423394:4-nf] and fear to be seen? If thou fearest spectators thou wilt not have imitators: thou oughtest therefore to be seen. But thou must not do it to the end thou mayest be seen. Not there should be the end of thy joy, not there the goal of thy rejoicing, that thou shouldest account thyself to have gotten the whole fruit of thy good work, when thou art seen and praised. This is nothing. Despise thyself when thou art praised, let Him be praised in thee who worketh by thee. Therefore do not for thine own praise work the good thou doest: but to the praise of Him from whom thou hast the power to do good. From thyself thou hast the ill doing, from God thou hast the well doing. On the other hand, see perverse men, how preposterous they are. What they do well, they will needs ascribe to themselves; if they do ill, they will needs accuse God. Reverse this distorted and preposterous proceeding, which puts the thing, as one may say, head downwards, which makes that undermost which is uppermost,[fn-44-P4494_2424491:5-nf] and that upwards which is downwards. Dost thou want to make God undermost and thyself uppermost? Thou goest headlong, not elevatest thyself; for He is always above. What then? thou well, and God ill? nay rather, say this, if thou wouldest speak more truly, I ill, He well; and what I do well from Him is the well-doing: for from myself whatever I do is ill. This confession strengthens the heart, and makes a firm foundation of love. For if we ought to hide our good works lest they be seen of men, what becomes of that sentence of the Lord in the sermon which He delivered on the mount? Where He said this, there He also said a little before, \"Let your good works shine before men.\"[fn-44-P4495_2425447:6-nf] And He did not stop there, did not there make an end, but added, \"And glorify your Father which is in Heaven.\" And what saith the apostle? \"And I was unknown by face unto the Churches of Judea which were in Christ: but they heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. And in me they glorified God.\"[fn-44-P4496_2425822:7-nf] See how he also, in regard that he became so widely known did not set the good in his own praise, but in the praise of God. And as for him, in his own person, that he was one who laid waste the Church, a persecutor, envious, malignant, it is himself that confesses this, not we that reproach him therewith. Paul loves to have his sins spoken of by us, that He may be glorified who healed such a disease. For it was the hand of the Physician that cut end healed the greatness of the sore. That voice from heaven prostrated the persecutor, and raised up the preacher; killed Saul, and quickened Paul.[fn-44-P4497_2426439:8-nf] For Saul was the persecutor of a holy man; thence had this man his name, when he persecuted the Christians:[fn-44-P4498_2426568:9-nf] afterward of Saul he became Paul. What does the name Paulus mean? Little. Therefore when he was Saul, he was proud, lifted up; when he was Paul, he was lowly, little, Thus we say, I will see thee \"paulo post,\" i.e. after a little while.[fn-44-P4499_2426821:10-nf] Hear that he was made little: \"For I am the least of the apostles;[fn-45-P4500_2427767:11-nf] and, To me the least of all saints,\" he saith in another place.

Shew mercy then, as men of merciful hearts; because in loving enemies also, ye love brethren. Think not that John hasgiven no precept concerning love of our enemy, because he has not ceased to speak of brotherly love. Ye love brethren. \"How,\" sayest thou, \"do we love brethren?\" I ask wherefore thou lovest anenemy. Wherefore dost thou love him? That he may be whole in this life? what if it be not expedient for him? That he may be rich? what if by his very riches he shall be blinded? That he may marry a wife? what if he shall have a bitter life of it? That he may have children? what if they shall be bad? Uncertain therefore are these things which thou seemest to wish for thine enemy, in that thou lovest him; they are uncertain. Wish for him that he may have with thee eternal life; wish for him that he may be thy brother: when thou lovest him, thou lovest a brother. For thou lovest in him not what he is, but what thou wishest that he may be. I once said to you, my beloved, if I mistake not: There is a log of timber lying in sight; a good workman has seen the log, not yet planed, just as it was hewn from the forest, he has taken a liking to it, he would make something out of it. For indeed he did not love it to this end that it should always remain thus. In his art he has seen what it shall be, not in his liking what it is; and his liking is for the thing he will make of it, not for the thing it is. So God loved us sinners. We say that God loved sinners: for He saith, \"They that are whole need not the Physician, but they that are sick.\"[fn-45-P4531_2445471:34-nf] Did He love us sinners to the end we should still remain sinners? As timber from the wood our Carpenter saw us, and had in His thoughts the building He would make thereof, not the unwrought timber that it was. So too thou seest thine enemy striving against thee, raging, biting with words, exasperating with contumelies, harassing with hatred: thou hast regard to this in him, that he is a man. Thou seest all these things that are against thee, that they were done by man; and thou seest in him that he was made by God. Now that he was made man, was God's doing: but that be hates thee, is his doing; that he has ill-will at thee, is his doing. And what sayest thou in thy mind? Lord, be merciful to him, forgive him his sins, strike terror into him, changehim. Thou lovest not in him what he is, but what thou wishest him to be. Consequently, when thou lovest an enemy, thou lovest a brother. Wherefore, perfect love is the loving an enemy: which perfect love is in brotherly love. And let no man say that John the apostle has admonished us somewhat less, and the Lord Christ somewhat more. John has admonished us to love the brethren; Christ has admonished us to love even enemies. Mark to what end Christ hath bidden thee to love thine enemies. That they may remain always enemies? If He bade it for this end, that they should remain enemies, thou hatest,[fn-45-P4532_2446850:35-nf] not lovest. Mark how He Himself loved, i.e. because He would not that they should be still the persecutors they were, He said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-45-P4533_2447044:36-nf] Whom He willed to be forgiven, them He willed to be changed: whom He willed to be changed, of enemies He deigned to make brethren, and did in truth make them so. He was killed, was buried, rose again, ascended into heaven: sent the Holy Ghost to His disciples: they began with boldness to preach His name, they did miracles in the name of Him that was crucified and slain: those slayers of the Lord saw them; and they who in rage had shed His blood, by believing drank it.","title":"Homily VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_57_book_iii_","source_chapter":61,"source_paragraph":"214","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Not to participation in mysteries, then, and to fellowship in the wisdom hidden in a mystery, which God ordained before the world to the glory of His saints,[fn-88-P8847_2258427:183-nf] do we invite the wicked man, and the thief, and the housebreaker, and the poisoner, and the committer of sacrilege, and the plunderer of the dead, and all those others whom Celsus may enumerate in his exaggerating style, but such as these we invite to be healed.

Now, we may say that it is that process of reason which, from what is admitted, procures faith in what is disputed. Now, faith being twofold-the faith of knowledge and that of opinion-nothing prevents us from calling demonstration twofold, the one resting on knowledge, the other on opinion; since also knowledge and foreknowledge are designated as twofold, that which is essentially accurate, that which is defective. And is not the demonstration, which we possess, that alone which is true, as being supplied out of the divine Scriptures, the sacred writings, and out of the \"God-taught wisdom,\" according to the apostle? Learning, then, is also obedience to the commandments, which is faith in God. And faith is a power of God, being the strength of the truth. For example, it is said, \"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall remove the mountain.\"[fn-57-P5796_1761286:109-nf] And again, \"According to thy faith let it be to thee.\"[fn-57-P5797_1761364:110-nf] And one is cured, receiving healing by faith; and the dead is raised up in consequence of the power of one believing that he would be raised. The demonstration, however, which rests on opinion is human, and is the result of rhetorical arguments or dialectic syllogisms. For the highest demonstration, to which we have alluded, produces intelligent faith by the adducing and opening up of the Scriptures to the souls of those who desire to learn; the result of which is knowledge (gnosis). For if what is adduced in order to prove the point at issue is assumed to be true, as being divine and prophetic, manifestly the conclusion arrived at by inference from it will consequently he inferred truly; and the legitimate result of the demonstration will be knowledge. When, then, the memorial of the celestial and divine food was commanded to be consecrated in the golden pot, it was said, \"The omer was the tenth of the three measures.\"[fn-57-P5798_1762320:111-nf] For in ourselves, by the three measures are indicated three criteria; sensation of objects of sense, speech,-of spoken names and words, and the mind,-of intellectual objects. The Gnostic, therefore, will abstain from errors in speech, and thought, and sensation, and action, having heard \"that he that looks so as to lust hath committed adultery; \"[fn-57-P5799_1762735:112-nf] and reflecting that \"blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; \"[fn-58-P5800_1762833:113-nf] and knowing this, \"that not what enters into the mouth defileth, but that it is what cometh forth by the mouth that defileth the man. For out of the heart proceed thoughts.\"[fn-58-P5801_1763032:114-nf] This, as I think, is the true and just measure according to God, by which things capable of measurement are measured, the decad which is comprehensive of man; which summarily the three above-mentioned measures pointed out. There are body and soul, the five senses, speech, the power of reproduction-the intellectual or the spiritual faculty, or whatever you choose to call it. And we must, in a word, ascending above all the others, stop at the mind; as also certainly in the universe overleaping the nine divisions, the first consisting of the four elements put in one place for equal interchange: and then the seven wandering stars and the one that wanders not, the ninth, to the perfect number, which is above the nine,[fn-58-P5802_1763774:115-nf] and the tenth division, we must reach to the knowledge of God, to speak briefly, desiring the Maker after the creation.

Yesterday you were flung upon a bed, exhausted and paralyzed, and you had no one when the water should be troubled to put you into the pool.[fn-52-P5234_1745886:105-nf] Today you have Him Who is in one Person Man and God, or rather God and Man. You were raised up from your bed, or rather you took up your bed, and publicly acknowledged the benefit. Do not again be thrown upon your bed by sinning, in the evil rest of a body paralyzed by its pleasures. But as you now are, so walk, mindful of the command,[fn-52-P5235_1746246:106-nf] Behold thou art made whole; sin no more lest a worse thing happen unto thee if thou prove thyself bad after the blessing thou hast received. You have heard the loud voice, Lazarus, come forth,[fn-52-P5236_1746457:107-nf] as you lay in the tomb; not, however, after four days, but after many days; and you were loosed from the bonds of your graveclothes. Do not again become dead, nor live with those who dwell in the tombs;[fn-52-P5237_1746680:108-nf] nor bind yourself with the bonds of your own sins;[fn-52-P5238_1746749:109-nf] for it is uncertain whether you will rise again from the tomb till the last and universal resurrection, which will bring every work into judgment,[fn-52-P5239_1746919:110-nf] not to be healed, but to be judged, and to give account of all which for good or evil it has treasured up.","title":"Oration XL.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":9,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_56_homily_l_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Let us not then bring forward these things now, which were uttered because of some economy, but let us read all the laws, those in the New and those in the Old Testament, that are set down about almsgiving, and let us be very earnest about this matter.

And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":9,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time.

For if one by nature knows God, as Basilides thinks, who calls intelligence of a superior order at once faith and kingship, and a creation worthy of the essence of the Creator; and explains that near Him exists not power, but essence and nature and substance; and says that faith is not the rational assent of the soul exercising free-will, but an undefined beauty, belonging immediately to the creature;-the precepts both of the Old and of the New Testament are, then, superfluous, if one is saved by nature, as Valentinus would have it, and is a believer and an elect man by nature, as Basilides thinks; and nature would have been able, one time or other, to have shone forth, apart from the Saviour's appearance. But were they to say that the visit of the Saviour was necessary, then the properties of nature are gone from them, the elect being saved by instruction, and purification, and the doing of good works. Abraham, accordingly, who through hearing believed the voice, which promised under the oak in Mamre,\" I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed,\" was either elect or not. But if he was not, how did he straightway believe, as it were naturally? And if he was elect, their hypothesis is done away with, in as much as even previous to the coming of the Lord an election was found, and that saved: \"For it was reckoned to him for righteousness.\"[fn-72-P7206_2194133:10-nf] For if any one, following Marcion, should dare to say that the Creator (Dhmiourgo/n) saved the man that believed on him, even before the advent of the Lord, (the election being saved with their own proper salvation); the power of the good Being will be eclipsed; in as much as late only, and subsequent to the Creator spoken of by them in words of be good men, it made the attempt to save, and by instruction, and in imitation of him. But if, being such, the good Being save, according to them; neither is it his own that he saves, nor is it with the consent of him who formed the creation that he essays salvation, but by force or fraud. And how can he any more be good, acting thus, and being posterior? But if the locality is different, and the dwelling-place of the Omnipotent is remote from the dwelling-place of the good God; yet the will of him who saves, having been the first to begin, is not inferior to that of the good God.

For if anyone, who was ignorant of swimming but knew that the weight of his body could not be supported by water, wished from the proof which his inexperience afforded, to lay down that no one composed of solid flesh could possibly be supported on the liquid element, we ought not therefore to think his opinion a true one, which he seemed to bring forward in accordance with his own experience, since this can be shown to be not merely not impossible but actually extremely easily done by others, by the clearest proofs and ocular demonstration.

We ought not then to ascribe this wandering inclination of our heart either to human nature or to God its Creator. For it is a true statement of Scripture, that \"God made man upright; but they themselves found out many thoughts\"[fn-44-P4413_1624234:3-nf] The character of these then depends on us ourselves, for it says \"a good thought comes near to those that know it, but a prudent man will find it.\"[fn-44-P4414_1624407:4-nf] For where anything is subject to our prudence and industry so that it can be found out, there if it is not found out, we ought certainly to set it down to our own laziness or carelessness and not to the fault of our nature. And with this meaning the Psalmist also is in agreement, when he says: \"Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee: in his heart he hath disposed his ascents.\"[fn-44-P4415_1624815:5-nf] You see then that it lies in our power to dispose in our hearts either ascents, i.e., thoughts that belong to God, or descents; viz., those that sink down to carnal and earthly things. And if this was not in our power the Lord would not have rebuked the Pharisees, saying \"Why do ye think evil in your hearts?\"[fn-44-P4416_1625155:6-nf] nor wou. He have given this charge by the prophet, saying: \"Take away the evil of your thoughts from mine eyes;\" and \"How long shall wicked thoughts remain in you?\"[fn-44-P4417_1625339:7-nf] Nor would the character of them as of our works be taken into consideration in the day of judgment in our case as the Lord threatens by Isaiah: \"Lo, I come to gather together their works and thoughts together with all nations and tongues;\"[fn-44-P4418_1625606:8-nf] nor would it be right that we should be condemned or defended by their evidence in that terrible and dreadful examination, as the blessed Apostle says: \"Their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men according to my gospel.\"[fn-44-P4419_1625926:9-nf] ","title":"VII.

Why? but because the sounder in health he thinks himself, the more dangerous his sickness is! This was the case with the Jews. Christ came to them that were sick; He found them all sick. Let no one then flatter himself on his healthful state, test the physician give him up.[fn-43-P4352_1846990:7-nf] He found all sick; it is the Apostle's judgment, \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\"[fn-43-P4353_1847121:8-nf] Though He found them all sick, yet were there two sorts of sick folk.

But there was another sort of sick, who had already become infatuated through the sickness of iniquity, and did not know themselves to be sick; they mocked Him, because He received the sick, and said to His disciples, \"Lo, what manner of man is your Master, who eateth with publicans and sinners.\" And He who knew what and who they were answered them, \"They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.\" And He showed them who the \"whole\" were, and who the \"sick.\" \"I am not come,\" He saith, \"to call the righteous, but sinners.\"[fn-43-P4354_1848046:9-nf] If sinners, He would say, do not come to Me, wherefore am I come? for whose sake am I come?

And this too we can prove by the instances of calls in the gospels. For He chose Andrew and Peter and the rest of the apostles by the free compassion of His grace when they were thinking nothing of their healing and salvation. Zacchaeus, when in his faithfulness he was struggling to see the Lord, and making up for his littleness of stature by the height of the sycamore tree, He not only received, but actually honoured by the blessing of His dwelling with him. Paul even against his will and resisting He drew to Him. Another He charged to cleave to Him so closely that when he asked for the shortest possible delay in order to bury his father He did not grant it. To Cornelius when constantly attending to prayers and alms the way of salvation was shown by way of recompense, and by the visitation of an angel he was bidden to summon Peter, and learn from him the words of salvation, whereby he might be saved with all his. And so the manifold wisdom of God grants with manifold and inscrutable kindness salvation to men; and imparts to each one according to his capacity the grace of His bounty, so that He wills to grant His healing not according to the uniform power of His Majesty but according to the measure of the faith in which He finds each one, or as He Himself has imparted it to each one. For when one believed that for the cure of his leprosy the will of Christ alone was sufficient He healed him by the simple consent of His will, saying: \"I will, be thou clean.\"[fn-54-P5400_1935913:99-nf] When another prayed that He would come and raise his dead daughter by laying His hands on her, He entered his house as he had hoped, and granted what was asked of Him. When another believed that what was essential for his salvation depended on His command, and answered: \"Speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed,\"[fn-54-P5401_1936263:100-nf] He restored to their former strength the limbs that were relaxed, by the power of a word, saying: \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee.\"[fn-54-P5402_1936440:101-nf] To others hoping for restoration from the touch of His hem, He granted rich gifts of healing. To some, when asked, He bestowed remedies for their diseases. To others He afforded the means of healing unasked: others He urged on to hope, saying: \"Willest thou to be made whole?\"[fn-54-P5403_1936737:102-nf] to others when they were without hope He brought help spontaneously. The desires of some He searched out before satisfying their wants, saying: \"What will ye that I should do for you?\"[fn-54-P5404_1936943:103-nf] To another who knew not the way to obtain what he desired, He showed it in His kindness, saying: \"If thou believest thou shalt see the glory of God.\"[fn-54-P5405_1937117:104-nf] Among some so richly did He pour forth the mighty works of His cures that of them the Evangelist says' \"And He healed all their sick.\"[fn-54-P5406_1937276:105-nf] But among others the unfathomable depth of Christ's beneficence was so stopped up, that it was said: \"And Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their unbelief.\"[fn-54-P5407_1937472:106-nf] And so the bounty of God is actually shaped according to the capacity of man's faith, so that to one it is said:\" According to thy faith be it unto thee:\"[fn-54-P5408_1937652:107-nf] and toanother: \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee;\"[fn-54-P5409_1937751:108-nf] to another \"Be it unto thee according as thou wilt,\"[fn-54-P5410_1937830:109-nf] and again to another: \"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\"[fn-54-P5411_1937910:110-nf] ","title":"XIII.

And this, as we remember, happened in the case of the ruler in the gospel, who, as he believed that it was an easier thing for his son to be cured when sick than to be raised when dead, implored the Lord to come at once, saying: \"Lord, come down ere my child die;\" and though Christ reproved his lack of faith with these words: \"Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe,\" yet He did not manifest the grace of His Divinity in proportion to the weakness of his faith, nor did He expell the deadly disease of the fever by His bodily presence, as the man believed he would, but by the word of His power, saying: \"Go thy way, thy son liveth.\"[fn-54-P5416_1939153:111-nf] And we read also that the Lord poured forth this superabundance of grace in the case of the cure of the paralytic, when, though he only asked for the healing of the weakness by which his body was enervated, He first brought health to the soul by sating: \"Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.\" After which, when the scribes did not believe that He could forgive men's sins, in order to confound their incredulity, He set free by the power of His word the man's limb, and put an end to his disease of paralysis, by saying: \"Why think ye evil in. your hearts? Whether is easier to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, arise and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, then saith He to the sick of the palsy: Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.\"[fn-54-P5417_1939997:112-nf] And in the same way in the case of the man who had been lying for thirty-eight years near the edge of the pool, and hoping for a cure from the moving of the water, He showed the princely character of His bounty unasked. For when in His wish to arouse him for the saving remedy, He had said to him: \"wiliest thou to be made whole,\" and when the man complained of his lack of human assistance and said: \"I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled,\" the Lord in His pity granted pardon to his unbelief and ignorance, and restored him to his former health, not in the way which he expected, but in the way which He Himself willed, saying: \"Arise, take up thy bed and go unto thine house.\"[fn-54-P5418_1940729:113-nf] And what wonder if these acts are told of the Lord's power, when Divine grace has actually wrought similar works by means of His servants! For when Peter and John were entering the temple, when the man who was lame from his mother's womb and had no idea how to walk, asked an alms, they gave him not the miserable coppers which the sick man asked for, but the power to walk, and when he was only expecting the smallest of gifts to console him, enriched him with the prize of unlooked for health, as Peter said: \"Silver and gold have I none: but such as I have, give I unto thee.

The physician gave us precepts, when we were whole; He gave us precepts that we might not need a physician. \"They that are whole,\" He saith, \"need not a physician, but they that are sick.\"[fn-46-P4691_2011267:15-nf] When whole we despised these precepts, and by experience have felt how to our own destruction we despised His precepts. Now we are sick, we are in distress, we are on the bed of weakness; yet let us not despair. For because we could not come to the Physician, He hath vouchsafed to come Himself to us. Though despised by man when he was whole, He did not despise him when he was stricken. He did not leave off to give other precepts to the weak, who would not keep the first precepts, that he might not be weak; as though He would say, \"Assuredly thou hast by experience felt that I spake the truth when I said, Touch not this. Be healed then now at length, and recover the life thou hast lost. Lo, I am bearing thine infirmity; drink thou the bitter cup. For thou hast of thine own self made those my so sweet precepts which were given to thee when whole, so toilsome. They were despised and so thy distress began; cured thou canst not be, except thou drink the bitter cup, the cup of temptations, wherein this life abounds, the cup of tribulation, anguish, and sufferings. Drink then,\" He says, \"drink, that thou mayest live.\" And that the sick man may not make answer, \"I cannot, I cannot bear it, I will not drink;\" the Physician, all whole though he be, drinketh first, that the sick man may not hesitate to drink. For what bitterness is there in this cup, which He hath not drunk? If it be contumely; He heard it first when He drove out the devils, \"He hath a devil, and by Beelzebub He casteth out devils.\"[fn-46-P4692_2012800:16-nf] Whereupon in order to comfort the sick, He saith, \"If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of His household?\"[fn-46-P4693_2012979:17-nf] If pains are this bitter cup, He was bound and scourged and crucified. If death be this bitter cup, He died also. If infirmity shrink with horror from any particular kind of death, none was at that time more ignominious than the death of the cross. For it was not in vain that the Apostle, when setting forth His obedience, added, \"Made obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\"[fn-46-P4694_2013385:18-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXXVIII.

To reject and refute which,\neven though the horrible character of the utterance is enough, we will still add some instances. Tell\nme, I pray, you who say that the fact that the devils feared Him was not His own doing but another's,\nand who will have it that this was not His own power but a gift, how was it that even His name had\nthat power, of which He Himself was, according to you, void? How was it that in His name devils were\ncast out, sick persons were cured, dead men were raised? For the Apostle Peter says to that lame man\nwho was sitting at the beautiful gate of the Temple: \"In the name of Jesus Christ arise and\nwalk.\"[fn-75-P7555_2780724:48-nf] And again in the city of Joppa to\nthe man who had been lying on his bed paralysed for eight years he says, \"Aeneas, may the Lord Jesus\nChrist heal thee: arise and make thy bed for thyself.\"[fn-75-P7556_2780932:49-nf] Paul too says to the pythonical spirit: \"I charge\nthee in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her,\" and the devil came out of her.[fn-75-P7557_2781084:50-nf] But understand from this how utterly alien this\nweakness was from our Lord: for I do not call even those weak, whom He by His name made strong, since\nwe never heard of any devil or infirmity able to resist any of the apostles since the Lord's\nresurrection. How then did the Spirit make Him to be feared, who made others to be feared? Or was He\nin Himself weak, whose faith even through the instrumentality of others reigned over all things?\nFinally those men who received power from God, never used that power as if it were their own: but\nreferred the power to Him from whom they received it: for the power itself could never have any force\nexcept through the name of Him who gave it. And so both the apostles and all the servants of God\nnever did any thing in their own name, but in the name and invocation of Christ: for the power itself\nderived its force from the same source as its origin, and could not be given through the\ninstrumentality of the ministers, unless it had come from the Author.

He says to the paralytic: \"Arise, take up thy\nbed, and go to thine house.\"[fn-75-P7558_2782655:51-nf] And again to\na father who pleads on behalf of his child, He says: \"Go thy way: thy son liveth.\"[fn-75-P7559_2782772:52-nf] And where an only son of his mother was being\ncarried forth for burial, \"Young man,\" He says, \"I say unto thee Arise.\"[fn-75-P7560_2782913:53-nf] Did He then like those who received power from\nGod, ask that power might be given to Him for performing these things by the invocation of the Divine\nName? Why did He not Himself work by the name of the Spirit, just as the apostles wrought by His\nName? Finally, what does the gospel itself state about Him? It says: \"He was teaching them as one\nthat had authority, and not like the Scribes and Pharisees.\"[fn-75-P7561_2783341:54-nf] Or do you make out that He was so proud and\nhaughty as to put to the credit of His own might thepower which (according to you) He had received\nfrom God?

Archclaus said: Well, then, I shall also show from this, most excellent friends, and most judicious auditors, that his statement is by no means correct. For iron, to take an example, has not been an evil thing always, but only from the period of man's existence, and since his art turned it to evil by applying it to false uses; and every sin has come into existence since the period of man's being. Even that great serpent himself was not evil previous to man, but only after man, in whom he displayed the fruit of his wickedness, because he willed it himself. If, then, the father of wickedness makes his appearance to us after man has come into being, according to the Scriptures, how can he be unbegotten who has thus been constituted evil subsequently to man, who is himself a production? But, again, why should he exhibit himself as evil just from the period when, on your supposition, he did himself create man?[fn-34-P3406_902880:151-nf] What did he desire in him? If man's whole body was his own workmanship, what did he ardently affect in him? For one who ardently affects or desires, desires something which is different and better. If, indeed, man takes his origin from him in respect of the evil nature, we see how man was his own, as I have frequently shown.[fn-34-P3407_903363:152-nf] For if man was his own, he was also evil himself, just as it holds with our illustration of the like tree and the like fruit; for an evil tree, as you say, produces evil fruit. And seeing that all were evil, what did be desiderate, or in what could he show the beginning of his wickedness, if from the time of man's formation man was the cause of his wickedness? Moreover, the law and precept having been given to the man himself, the man had not by any means the power to yield obedience to the serpent, and to the statements which were made, by him; and had the man then yielded no obedience to him, what occasion would there have been for hun to be evil? But, again, if evil is unbegotten, how does it happen that man is sometimes found to be stronger than it? For, by obeying the law of God, he will often overcome every root of wickedness; and it would be a ridiculous thing if he, who is but the production, should be found to be stronger than the unbegotten. Moreover, whose is that law with its commandment-that commandment, I mean, which has been given to man? Without doubt it will be acknowledged to be God's. And how, then, can the law be given to an alien? or who can give his commandment to an enemy? Or, to speak of him who receives the commandment, how can he contend against the devil? that is to say, on this supposition, how can he contend against his own creator, as if the son, while he is a debtor to him for deeds of kindness, were to choose to inflict injuries on the father? Thus you but mark out the profitlessness[fn-34-P3408_905322:153-nf] of man on this side, if you suppose him to be contradicting by the law and commandment him who has made him, and to be making the effort to get the better of him. Yea, we shall have to fancy the devil himself to have gone to such an excess of folly, as not to have perceived that in making man he made an adversary for himself, and neither to have considered what might be his future, nor to have foreseen the actual consequence of his act; whereas even in ourselves. who are but productions, there are at least some small gifts of knowledge, and a measure of prudence, and a moderate degree of consideration, which is sometimes of a very trustworthy nature. And how, then, can we believe that in the unbegotten there is not some little portion of prudence, or consideration, or intelligence? Or how can we make the contrary supposition, according to your assertion, namely, that he is discovered to be of the most senseless apprehension, and the dullest heart and in short rather like the brutes in his natural constitution? But if the case stands thus, again, how is it that man, who is possessed of no insignificant power in mental capacity and knowledge, could have received his substance from one who thus is, of all beings, the most ignorant and the bluntest in apprehension? How shall any one be rash enough to profess that man is the workmanship of an author of this character? But, again, if man consists both of soul and of body, and not merely of body without soul, and if the one cannot subsist apart from the other, why will you assert that these two are antagonistic and contrary to each other? For our Lord Jesus Christ, indeed, seems to me to have spoken of these in His parables, when He said: \"No man can put new wine into old bottles, else the bottles will break, and the wine run out.\"[fn-34-P3409_907261:154-nf] But new wine is to be put into new bottles, as there is indeed one and the same Lord for the bottle and for the wine. For although the substance may be different, yet by these two substances, in their due powers, and in the maintenance of their proper mutual relations.[fn-34-P3410_907552:155-nf] the one person of man subsists. We do not say, indeed, that the soul is of one substance with the body, but we aver that they have each their own characteristic qualities; and as the bottle and the wine are applied in the similitude to one race and one species of men, so truth's reckoning requires us to grant that man was produced complete by the one God: for the soul rejoices in the body, and loves and cherishes it; and none the less does the body rejoice that it is quickened by the soul. But if, on the other hand, a person maintains that the body is the work of the wicked one, inasmuch as it is so corruptible, and antiquated, and worthless, it would follow then that it is incapable of sustainting the virtue of the spirit or the movement of the soul, and the most splendid creation of the same. For just as, when a person puts a piece of new cloth into an old garment, the rent is made worse;[fn-34-P3411_908496:156-nf] so also the body would perish if it were to be associated, under such conditions, with that most brilliant production the soul. Or, to use another illustration: just as, when a man carries the light of a lamp into a dark place the darkness is forthwith put to flight and makes no appearance; so we ought to understand that, on the soul's introduction into the body the darkness is straightway banished, and one nature at once effected, and one man constituted in one species. And thus, agreeably therewith, it will be allowed that the new wine is put into new bottles, and that the piece of new cloth is not put into the old garment. But from this we are able to show that there is a unison of powers in these two substances, that is to say, in that of the body and in that of the soul; of which unison that greatest teacher in the Scriptures, Paul, speaks, when he tells us, that \"God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased Him.\"[fn-34-P3412_909480:157-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":9,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-06","text":"18.

Or, to use another illustration: just as, when a man carries the light of a lamp into a dark place the darkness is forthwith put to flight and makes no appearance; so we ought to understand that, on the soul's introduction into the body the darkness is straightway banished, and one nature at once effected, and one man constituted in one species. And thus, agreeably therewith, it will be allowed that the new wine is put into new bottles, and that the piece of new cloth is not put into the old garment. But from this we are able to show that there is a unison of powers in these two substances, that is to say, in that of the body and in that of the soul; of which unison that greatest teacher in the Scriptures, Paul, speaks, when he tells us, that \"God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased Him.\"[fn-34-P3412_909480:157-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":9,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_203_sermon_lxii_on_the_passion_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"To this forgiveness the traitor Judas could not attain: for he, the son of perdition, at whose right the devil stood[fn-37-P3704_933215:8-nf] , gave himself up to despair before Christ accomplished the mystery of universal redemption.
