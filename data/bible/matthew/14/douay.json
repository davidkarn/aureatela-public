{"verses":["At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus.","And he said to his servants:  This is John the Baptist:  he is\nrisen from the dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves\nin him.","For Herod had apprehended John and bound him, and put him into\nprison, because of Herodias, his brother's wife.","For John said to him:  It is not lawful for thee to have her.","And having a mind to put him to death, he feared the people:\nbecause they esteemed him as a prophet.","But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before\nthem:  and pleased Herod.","Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she\nwould ask of him.","But she being instructed before by her mother, said:  Give me here\nin a dish the head of John the Baptist.","And the king was struck sad:  yet because of his oath, and for\nthem that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given.","And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.","And his head was brought in a dish:  and it was given to the\ndamsel, and she brought it to her mother.","And his disciples came and took the body, and buried it, and\ncame and told Jesus.","Which when Jesus had heard, he retired from thence by a boat,\ninto a desert place apart, and the multitudes having heard of it,\nfollowed him on foot out of the cities.","And he coming forth saw a great multitude, and had compassion on\nthem, and healed their sick.","And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying:  This\nis a desert place, and the hour is now passed:  send away the\nmultitudes, that going into the towns, they may buy themselves\nvictuals.","But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go:  give you them\nto eat.","They answered him:  We have not here, but five loaves, and two\nfishes.","Who said to them:  Bring them hither to me.","And when he had commanded the multitude to sit down upon the\ngrass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to\nheaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples,\nand the disciples to the multitudes.","And they did all eat, and were filled.  And they took up what\nremained, twelve full baskets of fragments.","And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand men,\nbesides women and children.","And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the\nboat, and to go before him over the water, till he dismissed the\npeople.","And having dismissed the multitude, he went into a mountain\nalone to pray.  And when it was evening, he was there alone.","But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves:\nfor the wind was contrary.","And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking\nupon the sea.","And they seeing him walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying:\nIt is an apparition.  And they cried out for fear.","And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying:  Be of good heart:\nit is I, fear ye not.","And Peter making answer, said:  Lord, if it be thou, bid me come\nto thee upon the waters.","And he said:  Come.  And Peter going down out of the boat walked\nupon the water to come to Jesus.","But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid:  and when he began to\nsink, he cried out, saying:  Lord, save me.","And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of\nhim, and said to him:  O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?","And when they were come up into the boat, the wind ceased.","And they that were in the boat came and adored him, saying:\nIndeed thou art the Son of God.","And having passed the water, they came into the country of\nGenesar.","And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent\ninto all that country, and brought to him all that were diseased.","And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his\ngarment.  And as many as touched, were made whole."]}
