For these, for the most part, are the sources whence, from some ignorance or simplicity, custom finds its beginning; and then it is successionally confirmed into an usage, and thus is maintained in opposition to truth. But our Lord Christ has surnamed Himself Truth,[fn-5-P551_114823:2-nf] not Custom. If Christ is always, and prior to all, equally truth is a thing sempiternal and ancient. Let those therefore look to themselves, to whom that is new which is intrinsically old. It is not so much novelty as truth which convicts heresies. Whatever savours of opposition to truth, this will be heresy, even (if it be an) ancient custom. On the other hand, if any is ignorant of anything, the ignorance proceeds from his own defect. Moreover, whatever is matter of ignorance ought to have been as carefully inquired into as whatever is matter of acknowledgment received. The rule of faith, indeed, is altogether one, alone immoveable and irreformable; the rule, to wit, of believing in one only God omnipotent, the Creator of the universe, and His Son Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, raised again the third day from the dead, received in the heavens, sitting now at the right (hand) of the Father, destined to come to judge quick and dead through the resurrection of the flesh as well (as of the spirit). This law of faith being constant, the other succeeding points of discipline and conversation admit the \"novelty\" of correction; the grace of God, to wit, operating and advancing even to the end. For what kind of (supposition) is it, that, while the devil is always operating and adding daily to the ingenuities of iniquity, the work of God should either have ceased, or else have desisted from advancing? whereas the reason why the Lord sent the Paraclete was, that, since human mediocrity was unable to take in all things at once, discipline should, little by little, be directed, and ordained, and carried on to perfection, by that Vicar of the Lord, the Holy Spirit. \"Still,\" He said, \"I have many things to say to you, but ye are not yet able to bear them: when that Spirit of truth shall have come, He will conduct you into all truth, and will report to you the supervening (things).\"[fn-5-P552_116781:3-nf] But above, withal, He made a declaration concerning this His work.[fn-5-P553_116891:4-nf] What, then, is the Paraclete's administrative office but this: the direction of discipline, the revelation of the Scriptures, the reformation of the intellect, the advancement toward the \"better things? \"[fn-5-P554_117117:5-nf] Nothing is without stages of growth: all things await their season. In short, the preacher says, \"A time to everything.\"[fn-5-P555_117269:6-nf] Look how creation itself advances little by little to fructification. First comes the grain, and from the grain arises the shoot, and from the shoot struggles out the shrub: thereafter boughs and leaves gather strength, and the whole that we call a tree expands: then follows the swelling of the germen, and from the germen bursts the flower, and from the flower the fruit opens: that fruit itself, rude for a while, and unshapely, little by little, keeping the straight course of its development, is trained to the mellowness of its flavour.[fn-5-P556_117841:7-nf] So, too, righteousness-for the God of righteousness and of creation is the same-was first in a rudimentary state, having a natural fear of God: from that stage it advanced, through the Law and the Prophets, to infancy; from that stage it passed, through the Gospel, to the fervour of youth: now, through the Paraclete, it is settling into maturity. He will be, after Christ, the only one to be called and revered as Master;[fn-5-P557_118287:8-nf] for He speaks not from Himself, but what is commanded by Christ.[fn-5-P558_118377:9-nf] He is the only prelate, because He alone succeeds Christ.

But Mesopotamia, he says, is the current of the great ocean flowing from the midst of the Perfect Man; and he was astonished at the celestial gate, exclaiming, \"How terrible is this place! it is nought else than the house of God, and this (is) the gate of heaven.\"[fn-10-P1055_278451:87-nf] On account of this, he says, Jesus uses the words, \"I am the true gate.\"[fn-10-P1056_278548:88-nf] Now he who makes these statements is, he says, the Perfect Man that is imaged from the unportrayable one from above. The Perfect Man therefore cannot, he says, be saved, unless, entering in through this gate, he be born again. But this very one the Phrygians, he says, call also Papa, because he tranquillized all things which, prior to his manifestation, were confusedly and dissonantly moved. For the name, he says, of Papa belongs simultaneously to all creatures[fn-10-P1057_279046:89-nf] -celestial, and terrestrial, and infernal-who exclaim, Cause to cease, cause to cease the discord of the world, and make \"peace for those that are afar off,\" that is, for material and earthly beings; and \"peace for those that are near,\"[fn-10-P1058_279383:90-nf] that is, for perfect men that are spiritual and endued with reason. But the Phrygians denominate this same also \"corpse\"-buried in the body, as it were, in a mausoleum and tomb. This, he says, is what has been declared, \"Ye are whited sepulchres, full,\" he says, \"of dead men's bones within,\"[fn-10-P1059_279694:91-nf] because there is not in you the living man.

These same Phrygians, however, he says, affirm again that this very (man), as a consequence of the change, (becomes) a god. For, he says, he becomes a god when, having risen from the dead, he will enter into heaven through a gate of this kind. Paul the apostle, he says, knew of this gate, partially opening it in a mystery, and stating \"that he was caught up by an angel, and ascended as far as the second and third heaven into paradise itself; and that he beheld sights and heard unspeakable words which it would not be possible for man to declare.\"[fn-10-P1061_280630:93-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":23,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"248","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"While the disciples were disputing concerning precedence our Lord, the teacher of humility, took a little child and said: \"Except ye be converted and become as little children ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-3-P341_60644:157-nf] And lest He should seem to preach more than he practised, He fulfilled His own precept in His life.

Now when we have reason to be doubtful about a point, we need not doubt that we are right in doubting. There is no doubt but that we ought to doubt things that are doubtful. For instance, the Apostle has no doubt about doubting whether he was in the body or out of the body when he was carried up into the third heaven.[fn-55-P5501_1532243:3907-nf] Whether it was thus or thus, he says, I know not; God knows. Why may not I, then, so long as I have no light, doubt whether my soul comes to me by generation or unengendered? Why may I not be doubtful about this, so long as I do not doubt that in either case it is the work of God most high? Why may I not say; \"I know that my soul owes its existence to God and is altogether His handiwork; but whether it comes by generation, as the body does, or unengendered, as was Adam's soul, I know not; God knows.\" You wish me to assert positively one view or the other. I might do so if I knew which was right. You may have some light on the point, and if so you will find me keener to learn what I know not than to teach what I know. But if, like myself, you are in the dark, you should pray, as I do, that either through one of His servants, or with His own lips, He would teach us who said to His disciples: \"Be not ye called masters; for one is your master, even Christ.\"[fn-55-P5502_1533235:3908-nf] Yet such knowledge is only expedient for us when He knows it to be expedient who knows both what He has to teach and what we ought to learn. Nevertheless, to you, my dear friend, I confess my eagerness. Still much as I desire to know this after which you seek, I would sooner know when the desire of all nations shall come and when the kingdom of the saints will be set up, than how my soul has come to its earthly abode. But when His disciples (who are our apostles) put this question to the all-knowing Christ, they were told: \"It is not yours to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.\"[fn-55-P5503_1533885:3909-nf] What if Christ, who knows what is expedient for us, knows this knowledge not to be expedient? Through Him I know that it is not ours to know the times which God has placed in His own power; but concerning the origin of souls, I am ignorant whether it is or is not ours to know. If I could be sure that such knowledge is not for us, I should cease not only to dogmatize, but even to inquire. As it is, though the subject is so deep and dark that my fear of becoming a rash teacher is almost greater than my eagerness to learn the truth, I still wish to know it if I can do so. It may be that the knowledge for which the psalmist prays: \"Lord, make me to know mine end,\"[fn-55-P5504_1534574:3910-nf] is much more necessary; yet I would that my beginning also might be revealed to me.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":23,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"79. And in [the interpretation of] this passage we must be very much on our guard against the error of those who judge from these same two trees that there are two original natures, the one of which belongs to God, but the other neither belongs to God nor springs from Him. And this error has both been already discussed in other books [of ours][fn-9-P935_362108:222-nf] very copiously, and if that is still too little, will be discussed again; but at present we have merely to show that the two trees before us do not help them. In the first place, because it is so clear that He is speaking of men, that whoever reads what goes before and what follows will wonder at their blindness. Secondly, they fix their attention on what is said, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\" and therefore think that neither can it happen that an evil soul should be changed into something better, nor a good one into something worse; as if it were said, A good tree cannot become evil, nor an evil tree good. But it is said, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\" For the tree is certainly the soul itself, i.e. the man himself, but the fruits are the works of the man; an evil man, therefore, cannot perform good works, nor a good man evil works. If an evil man, therefore, wishes to perform good works, let him first become good. So the Lord Himself says in another passage more plainly: \"Either make the tree good, or make the tree bad.\" But if He were figuratively representing the two natures of such parties by these two trees, He would not say, \"Make:\" for who of the sons of men can make a nature? Then also in that passage, when He had made mention of these two trees, He added, \"Ye hypocrites, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?\"[fn-9-P936_363877:223-nf] As long, therefore, as any one is evil, he cannot bring forth good fruits; for if he were to bring forth good fruits, he would no longer be evil. So it might most truly have been said, snow cannot be warm; for when it begins to be warm, we no longer call it snow, but water. It may therefore come about, that what was snow is no longer so; but it cannot happen that snow should be warm. So it may come about, that he who was evil is no longer evil; it cannot, however, happen that an evil man should do good. And although he is sometimes useful, this is not the man's own doing; but it is done through him, in virtue of the arrangements of divine providence: as, for instance, it is said of the Pharisees, \"What they bid you, do; but what they do, do not consent to do.\" This very circumstance, that they spoke things that were good, and that the things which they spoke were usefully listened to and done, was not a matter belonging to them: for, says He, \"they sit in Moses' seat.\"[fn-9-P937_364887:224-nf] It was, therefore, when engaged through divine providence in preaching the law of God, that they were able to be useful to their hearers, although they were not so to themselves.

If, then, forasmuch as there is in the law a precept that a man is to take in marriage the wife of his brother if he have died without children,[fn-11-P1142_297844:44-nf] for the purpose of raising up seed to his brother; and this may happen repeatedly to the same person, according to that crafty question of the Sadducees;[fn-11-P1143_298020:45-nf] men for that reason think that frequency of marriage is permitted in other cases as well: it will be their duty to understand first the reason of the precept itself; and thus they will come to know that that reason, now ceasing, is among those parts of the law which have been cancelled. Necessary it was that there should be a succession to the marriage of a brother if he died childless: first, because that ancient benediction, \"Grow and multiply,\"[fn-11-P1144_298553:46-nf] had still to run its course; secondly, because the sins of the fathers used to be exacted even from the sons;[fn-11-P1145_298707:47-nf] thirdly, because eunuchs and barren persons used to be regarded as ignominious. And thus, for fear that such as had died childless, not from natural inability, but from being prematurely overtaken by death, should be judged equally accursed (with the other class); for this reason a vicarious and (so to say) posthumous offspring used to be supplied them. But (now), when the \"extremity of the times\" has cancelled (the command) \"Grow and multiply,\" since the apostles (another command), \"It remaineth, that both they who have wives so be as if they have not,\" because \"the time is compressed;[fn-11-P1146_299388:48-nf] and \"the sour grape\" chewed by \"the fathers\" has ceased \"to set the sons' teeth on edge,\"[fn-11-P1147_299510:49-nf] for, \"each one shall die in his own sin; \"and \"eunuchs\" not only have lost ignominy, but have even deserved grace, being invited into \"the kingdoms of the heavens: \"[fn-11-P1148_299748:50-nf] the law of succeeding to the wife of a brother being buried, its contrary has obtained-that of not succeeding to the wife of a brother.

Therefore a wife, when her husband is dead, will not marry; for if she marry, she will of course be marrying (his) brother: for \"all we are brethren.\"[fn-11-P1149_300212:51-nf] Again, the woman, if intending to marry, has to marry \"in the Lord; \"[fn-11-P1150_300303:52-nf] that is, not to an heathen, but to a brother, inasmuch as even the ancient law forbids[fn-11-P1151_300411:53-nf] marriage with members of another tribe.

The daughter also of a priest it bids, if widowed or repudiated, if she have had no seed, to return into her father's home and be nourished from his bread.[fn-11-P1153_301425:55-nf] The reason why (it is said), \"If she have had no seed,\" is not that if she have she may marry again-for how much more will she abstain from marrying if she have sons?-but that, if she have, she may be \"nourished\" by her son rather than by her father; in order that the son, too, may carry out the precept of God, \"Honour father and mother.\"[fn-11-P1154_301870:56-nf] Us, moreover, Jesus, the Father's Highest and Great Priest,[fn-11-P1155_301956:57-nf] clothing us from His own store[fn-11-P1156_302153:58-nf] -inasmuch as they \"who are baptized in Christ[fn-11-P1157_302352:59-nf] have put on Christ\"-has made \"priests to God His Father,\"[fn-11-P1158_302463:60-nf] according to John. For the reason why He recalls that young man who was hastening to his father's obsequies,[fn-11-P1159_302592:61-nf] is that He may show that we are called priests by Him; (priests) whom the Law used to forbid to be present at the sepulture of parents:[fn-11-P1160_302770:62-nf] \"Over every dead soul,\" it says, \"the priest shall not enter, and over his own father and over his own mother he shall not be contaminated.\" \"Does it follow that we too are bound to observe this prohibition? \"No, of course.

For they too were men, and there was inherent in them that power of nature, which enables the rational soul both to perceive and do what is lawful; but the godliness which transfers to another life happy and immortal has \"a spotless law, converting souls,\"[fn-16-P1647_751890:244-nf] so that by the light thereof they may be renewed, and that be accomplished in them which is written, \"There has been manifested over us, O Lord, the light of Thy countenance.\"[fn-16-P1648_752085:245-nf] Turned away from which, they have deserved to grow old, whilst they are incapable of renovation except by the grace of Christ,-in other words, without the intercession of the Mediator; there being \"one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all.\"[fn-16-P1649_752406:246-nf] Should those be strangers to His grace of whom we are treating, and who (after the manner of which we have spoken with sufficient fulness already) \"do by nature the things contained in the law,\"[fn-16-P1650_752625:247-nf] of what use will be their \"excusing thoughts\" to them \"in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men,\"[fn-16-P1651_752753:248-nf] unless it be perhaps to procure for them a milder punishment? For as, on the one hand, there are certain venial sins which do not hinder the righteous man from the attainment of eternal life, and which are unavoidable in this life, so, on the other hand, there are some good works which are of no avail to an ungodly man towards the attainment of everlasting life, although it would be very difficult to find the life of any very bad man whatever entirely without them. But inasmuch as in the kingdom of God the saints differ in glory as one star does from another,[fn-16-P1652_753343:249-nf] so likewise, in the condemnation of everlasting punishment, it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that other city;[fn-16-P1653_753487:250-nf] whilst some men will be twofold more the children of hell than others.[fn-16-P1654_753577:251-nf] Thus in the judgment of God not even this fact will be without its influence,-that one man will have sinned more, or less, than another, even when both are involved in the ungodliness that is worthy of damnation.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_13_letter_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"For if, even as it is, when we have not this power in ourselves, we make violent efforts, and give ourselves up to shadow painting, and because we cannot in reality produce bodily beauty, cunningly devise imitations by means of paints, and dyes, and dressing of hair, and arrangement of garments, and pencilling of eyebrows, and many other contrivances: what leisure should we have set apart for the soul and serious matters, if we had it in our power to transfigure the body into a really symmetrical shape? For probably, if this were our business, we should not have any other, but should spend all our time upon it: decking the bondmaid with countess decorations, but letting her who is the mistress of this bond-maid lie perpetually in a state of deformity and neglect. For this reason God, having delivered us from this vain occupation, implanted in us the power of working upon the nobler element, and he who cannot turn an ugly body into a comely on, can raise the soul, even when it has been reduced to the extremity of ugliness, to the very acme of grace, and make it so amiable and desirable that not only are good men brought to long after it but even He who is the sovereign and God of all, even as the Psalmist also when discoursing concerning this beauty, said \"And the king shall have desire of thy beauty.\"[fn-6-P669_391705:50-nf] Seest thou not also that in the houses of prostitutes the women who are ugly and shameless would hardly be accepted by prize-fighters, and runaway slaves, and gladiators: but should any comely, well-born and modest woman, owing to some mischance, have been reduced to this necessity, no man, even amongst those who are very illustrious and great, would be ashamed of marriage with her? Now if there is so much pity amongst men, and so much disdain of glory as to release from that bondage the women who have often been disgraced in the brothel, and to place them in the position of wives, much more is this the case with God, and those souls which, owing to the usurpation of the devil, have then from their original noble condition into the harlotry of this present life. And you will find the prophets filled with examples of this kind, when they address Jerusalem; for she fell into fornication, and a novel form of it, even as Ezekiel says: \"To all harlots wages are given, but thou hast given wages to thy lovers, and there hath been perversion in thee beyond all other women,\"[fn-6-P670_392807:51-nf] and again another saith \"Thou didst sit waiting for them like a deserted bird.\"[fn-6-P671_392940:52-nf] This one then who hath committed fornication in this fashion God calls back again. For the captivity which took place was not so much by way of vengeance as for the purpose of conversion and amendment since if God had wished to punish them out-fight He would not again have brought them back to their home. He would not have established their city and their temple in greater splendour than before: \"For the final glory of this house\" He said \"shall exceed the former.\"[fn-6-P672_393429:53-nf] Now if God did not exclude from repentance her who who had many times committed fornication, much more will He embrace My soul, which has now fallen for the first time. For certainly there is no lover of corporeal beauty, even if he be very frantic, who is so inflamed will the love of his mistress as God longs after the salvation of our souls; and this we may perceive both from the divine Scriptures. See at least, both in the introduction of Jeremiah, and many other places of the prophets, when He is despised and contemned, how He again hastens forward and pursues the friendship of those who turn away from him; which also He Himself made dear in the Gospels saying, \"O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?\"[fn-6-P673_394349:54-nf] And Paul writing to the Corinthians said \"that God was in Christ reconciling the word unto Himself, not reckoning their trespasses unto them, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ be ye reconciled to God.\"[fn-6-P674_394718:55-nf] Consider that this has now been said to us. For it is not merely want of faith, but also an unclean life which is sufficient to work this abominate enmity. \"For the carnal mind\" we read \"is enmity against God.\"[fn-6-P675_394954:56-nf] Let us then break down the barrier, and hew it in pieces, and destroy it, that we may enjoy the blessed reconciliation, that we may become again the fondly beloved of God.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":23,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_16_book_x","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"It was by faith in this mystery, and godliness of life, that purification was attainable even by the saints of old, whether before the law was given to the Hebrews (for God and the angels were even then present as instructors), or in the periods under the law, although the promises of spiritual things, being presented in figure, seemed to be carnal, and hence the name of Old Testament. For it was then the prophets lived, by whom, as by angels, the same promise was announced; and among them was he whose grand and divine sentiment regarding the end and supreme good of man I have just now quoted, \"It is good for me to cleave to God.\"[fn-17-P1724_976388:55-nf] In this psalm the distinction between the Old and New Testaments is distinctly announced. For the Psalmist says, that when he saw that the carnal and earthly promises were abundantly enjoyed by the ungodly, his feet were almost gone, his steps had well-nigh slipped; and that it seemed to him as if he had served God in vain, when he saw that those who despised God increased in that prosperity which he looked for at God's hand. He says, too, that, in investigating this matter with the desire of understanding why it was so, he had labored in vain, until he went into the sanctuary of God, and understood the end of those whom he had erroneously considered happy. Then he understood that they were cast down by that very thing, as he says, which they had made their boast, and that they had been consumed and perished for their inequities; and that that whole fabric of temporal prosperity had become as a dream when one awaketh, and suddenly finds himself destitute of all the joys he had imaged in sleep. And, as in this earth or earthy city they seemed to themselves to be great, he says, \"O Lord, in Thy city Thou wilt reduce their image to nothing.\" He also shows how beneficial it had been for him to seek even earthly blessings only from the one true God, in whose power are all things, for he says, \"As a beast was I before Thee, and I am always with Thee.\" \"As a beast,\" he says, meaning that he was stupid. For I ought to have sought from Thee such things as the ungodly could not enjoy as well as I, and not those things which I saw them enjoying in abundance, and hence concluded I was serving Thee in vain, because they who declined to serve Thee had what I had not. Nevertheless, \"I am always with Thee,\" because even in my desire for such things I did not pray to other gods. And consequently he goes on, \"Thou hast holden me by my right hand, and by Thy counsel Thou hast guided me, and with glory hast taken me up;\" as if all earthly advantages were left-hand blessings, though, when he saw them enjoyed by the wicked, his feet had almost gone. \"For what,\" he says, \"have I in heaven, and what have I desired from Thee upon earth?\" He blames himself, and is justly displeased with himself; because, though he had in heaven so vast a possession (as he afterwards understood), he yet sought from his God on earth a transitory and fleeting happiness;-a happiness of mire, we may say. \"My heart and my flesh,\" he says, \"fail, O God of my heart.\" Happy failure, from things below to things above! And hence in another psalm He says, \"My soul longeth, yea, even faileth, for the courts of the Lord.\"[fn-17-P1725_979023:56-nf] Yet, though he had said of both his heart and his flesh that they were failing, he did not say, O God of my heart and my flesh, but, O God of my heart; for by the heart the flesh is made clean. Therefore, says the Lord, \"Cleanse that which is within, and the outside shall be clean also.\"[fn-17-P1726_979332:57-nf] He then says that God Himself,-not anything received from Him, but Himself,-is his portion. \"The God of my heart, and my portion for ever.\" Among the various objects of human choice, God alone satisfied him. \"For, lo,\" he says, \"they that are far from Thee shall perish: Thou destroyest all them that go a-whoring from Thee,\"-that is, who prostitute themselves to many gods. And then follows the verse for which all the rest of the psalm seems to prepare: \"It is good forme to cleave to God,\"-not to go far off; not to go a-whoring with a multitude of gods. And then shall this union with God be perfected, when all that is to be redeemed in us has been redeemed. But for the present we must, as he goes on to say, \"place our hope in God.\" \"For that which is seen,\" says the apostle, \"is not hope. For what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-17-P1727_980275:58-nf] Being, then, for the present established in this hope, let us do what the Psalmist further indicates, and become in our measure angels or messengers of God, declaring His will, and praising His glory and His grace. For when he had said, \"To place my hope in God,\" he goes on, \"that I may declare all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.\" This is the most glorious city of God; this is the city which knows and worships one God: she is celebrated by the holy angels, who invite us to their society, and desire us to become fellow-citizens with them in this city; for they do not wish us to worship them as our gods, but to join them in worshipping their God and ours; nor to sacrifice to them, but, together with them, to become a sacrifice to God. Accordingly, whoever will lay aside malignant obstinacy, and consider these things, shall be assured that all these blessed and immortal spirits, who do not envy us (for if they envied they were not blessed), but rather love us, and desire us to be as blessed as themselves, look on us with greater pleasure, and give us greater assistance, when we join them in worshipping one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, than if we were to offer to themselves sacrifice and worship.","title":"Book X","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_104_sermon_lxxxvii_cxxxvii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6.

Augustin replied: As regards what Faustus calls his principal reason for not receiving the genealogy of Jesus Christ, a complete refutation is found in the passages formerly quoted, where Christ declares Himself to be the Son of man, and in what we have said of the identity of the Son of man with the Son of God: that in His Godhead He has no earthly descent, while after the flesh He is of the seed of David, as the apostle teaches. We are to believe, therefore, that He came forth from the Father, that He descended from heaven, and also that the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst men. If the words, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\"[fn-12-P1296_689691:1-nf] are quoted to show that Christ had no earthly mother or descent, it follows that we must believe that His disciples, whom He here teaches by His own example to set no value on earthly relationship, as compared with the kingdom of heaven, had no fathers, because Christ says to them, \"Call no man father upon earth; for one is your Father, even God.\"[fn-12-P1297_690059:2-nf] What He taught them to do with reference to their fathers, He Himself first did in reference to His own mother and brethren; as in many other things He condescended to set us an example, and to go before that we might follow in His footsteps. Faustus' principal objection to the genealogy fails completely; and after the defeat of this invincible force, the rest is easily routed. He says that the apostles who declared Christ to be the Son of man as well as the Son of God are not to be believed, because they were not present at the birth of Christ, whom they joined when He had reached manhood, nor heard of it from Christ Himself. Why then do they believe John when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made,\"[fn-12-P1298_690947:3-nf] and such passages, which they agree to, without understanding them? Where did John see this, or did he ever hear it from the Lord Himself? In whatever way John learned this, those who narrate the nativity may have learned also. Again, how do they know that the Lord said, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\" If on the authority of the evangelist, why do they not also believe that the mother and the brethren of Christ were seeking for Him? They believe that Christ said these words, which they misunderstand, while they deny a fact resting on the same authority. Once more, if Matthew could not know that Christ was born, because he knew Him only in His manhood, how could Manichaeus, who lived so long after, know that He was not born? They will say that Manichaeus knew this from the Holy Spirit which was in him. Certainly the Holy Spirit would make him speak the truth. But why not rather believe what Christ's own disciples tell us, who were personally acquainted with Him, and who not only had the gift of inspiration to supply defects in their knowledge, but in a purely natural way obtained information of the birth of Christ, and of His descent, when the event was fresh in memory? And yet he dares to call the apostles deaf and blind. Why were you not deaf and blind, to prevent you from learning such profane nonsense, and dumb too, to prevent you from uttering it?

The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all offenses.\"[fn-38-P3852_2120635:45-nf] Can He mean out of that kingdom in which are no offenses? Then it must be out of His present kingdom, the Church, that they are gathered. So He says, \"He that breaketh one of the least of these commandments, and teacheth men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth and teacheth thus shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-38-P3853_2121021:46-nf] He speaks of both as being in the kingdom of heaven, both the man who does not perform the commandments which He teaches,-for \"to break\" means not to keep, not to perform,-and the man who does and teaches as He did; but the one He calls least, the other great. And He immediately adds, \"For I say unto you, that except your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,\"-that is, the righteousness of those who break what they teach; for of the scribes and Pharisees He elsewhere says, \"For they say and do not;\"[fn-38-P3854_2121562:47-nf] -unless therefore, your righteousness exceed theirs that is, so that you do not break but rather do what you teach, \"ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-38-P3855_2121743:48-nf] We must understand in one sense the kingdom of heaven in which exist together both he who breaks what he teaches and he who does it, the one being least, the other great, and in another sense the kingdom of heaven into which only he who does what he teaches shall enter. Consequently, where both classes exist, it is the Church as it now is, but where only the one shall exist, it is the Church as it is destined to be when no wicked person shall be in her. Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly, even now His saints reign with Him, though otherwise than as they shall reign hereafter; and yet, though the tares grow in the Church along with the wheat, they do not reign with Him. For they reign with Him who do what the apostle says, \"If ye be risen with Christ, mind the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Seek those things which are above, not the things which are on the earth.\"[fn-38-P3856_2122737:49-nf] Of such persons he also says that their conversation is in heaven.[fn-38-P3857_2122825:50-nf] In fine, they reign with Him who are so in His kingdom that they themselves are His kingdom. But in what sense are those the kingdom of Christ who, to say no more, though they are in it until all offenses are gathered out of it at the end of the world, yet seek their own things in it, and not the things that are Christ's?[fn-38-P3858_2123169:51-nf] ","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_21_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But he also says that the essence of the Son is controlled by the Father, his exact words being as follows:-\"For He Who is and lives because of the Father, does not appropriate this dignity, as the essence which controls even Him attracts to itself the conception of the Existent.\" If these doctrines approve themselves to some of the sages \"who are without,\" let not the Gospels nor the rest of the teaching of the Holy Scripture be in any way disturbed.

Can our choice what to do be doubtful, or is the decision which is the more advantageous course unimportant? Shall I slight the advice of Paul, Eunomius? shall I deem the voice of the Truth less trustworthy than thy deceit?

Neither is there anything to compel us to a denial of the mother of the Lord, in the circumstance that this word was spoken by Him: \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.\"[fn-32-P3207_1484133:44-nf] But He rather admonishesus to understand that, in respect of His being God, there was no mother for Him, the part of whose personal majesty (cujus majestatis personam) He was preparing to show forth in the turning of water into wine. But as regards His being crucified, He was crucified in respect of his being man; and that was the hour which had not come as yet, at the time when this word was spoken, \"What have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not vet come;\" that is, the hour at which I shall recognize thee.

This is also a matter which requires some consideration,-namely, the question how it is said here, \"Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,\"[fn-21-P2161_900136:522-nf] when, according to this same Matthew, they had already expressed themselves to this effect.[fn-21-P2162_900252:523-nf] Besides, Luke likewise tells us that a reply containing these very words had previously been returned by the Lord to the persons who had counselled Him to leave their locality, because Herod sought to kill Him. That evangelist represents these self-same terms, which Matthew records here, to have been employed by Him in the declaration which He directed on that occasion against Jerusalem itself. For Luke's narrative proceeds in the following manner: \"The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto Him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. And He said unto them, Go ye and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected. Nevertheless, I must walk to-day, and to-morrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house shall be left unto you desolate: and I say unto you, that ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2163_901530:524-nf] There does not seem, however, to be anything contradictory to the narration thus given by Luke in the circumstance that the multitudes said, when the Lord was approaching Jerusalem, \"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\" For, according to the order which is followed by Luke, He had not yet come to the scene in question, and the words had not been uttered. But since he does not tell us that He did actually leave the place at that time, not to return to it until the period came when such words would be spoken by them (for He continues on His journey until he arrives at Jerusalem; and the saying, \"Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected,\" is to be taken to have been uttered by Him in a mystical and figurative sense: for certainly He did not suffer at a time answering literally to the third day after the present occasion; nay, He immediately goes on to say, \"Nevertheless, I must walk to-day, and to-morrow, and the day following\"), we are indeed constrained also to put a mystical interpretation upon the sentence, \"Ye shall not see me henceforth, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,\" and to understand it to refer to that advent of His in which He is to come in His effulgent brightness;[fn-21-P2164_902878:525-nf] it being thereby also implied, that what He expressed in the declaration, \"I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected,\" bears upon His body, which is the Church. For devils are cast out when the nations abandon their ancestral superstitions and believe on Him; and cures are wrought when men renounce the devil and this world, and live in accordance with His commandments, even unto the consummation of the resurrection, in which there shall, as it were, be realized that perfecting on the third day; that is to say, the Church shall be perfected up to the measure of the angelic fulness through the realized immortality of the body as well as the soul. Therefore the order followed by Matthew is by no means to be understood to involve a digression to another connection. But we are rather to suppose, either that Luke has antedated the events which took place in Jerusalem, and has introduced them at this point simply as they were here suggested to his recollection, before his narrative really brings the Lord to Jerusalem; or that the Lord, when drawing near the same city on that occasion, did actually reply to the persons who counselled Him to be on His guard against Herod, in terms resembling those in which Matthew represents Him to have spoken also to the multitudes at a period when He had already arrived in Jerusalem, and when all these events had taken place which have been detailed above.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"6. The next verse too is suspicious, \"If ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me;\" for the religion of Moses is so entirely different from that of Christ, that if the Jews believed one, they could not believe the other. Moses strictly forbids any work to be done on Sabbath, and gives as a reason for this prohibition that God made the world and all that is therein in six days, and rested on the seventh day, which is Sabbath; and therefore blessed or sanctified it as His haven of repose after toil, and commanded that breaking the Sabbath should be punished with death. The Jews, in obedience to Moses, insisted strongly on this, and so would not even listen to Christ when He told them that God always works, and that no day is appointed for the intermission of His pure and unwearied energy, and that accordingly He Himself had to work incessantly even on Sabbath. \"My Father,\" he says, \"worketh always, and I too must work.\"[fn-16-P1665_926556:5-nf] Again, Moses places circumcision among the rites pleasing to God, and commands every male to be circumcised in the foreskin of his flesh, and declares that this is a necessary sign of the covenant which God made with Abraham, and that every male not circumcised would be cut off from his tribe, and from his part in the inheritance promised to Abraham and to his seed.[fn-16-P1666_926940:6-nf] In this observance, too, the Jews were very zealous, and consequently could not believe in Christ, who made light of these things, and declared that a man when circumcised became twofold a child of hell.[fn-16-P1667_927164:7-nf] Again, Moses is very particular about the distinction in animal foods, and discourses like an epicure on the merits of fish, and birds, and quadrupeds, and orders some to be eaten as clean, and others which are unclean not to be touched. Among the unclean he reckons the swine and the hare, and fish without scales, and quadrupeds that neither divide the hoof nor chew the cud. In this also the Jews carefully obeyed Moses, and so could not believe in Christ, who taught that all food is alike, and though he allowed no animal food to his own disciples, gave full liberty to the laity to eat whatever they pleased, and taught that men are polluted not by what goes into the mouth, but by the evil things which come out of it.

Every one can see the weakness of the argument that Christ could not have said, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill,\" unless He had done something to create a suspicion of this kind. Of course, we grant that the unenlightened Jews may have looked upon Christ as the destroyer of the law and the prophets; but their very suspicion makes it certain that the true and truthful One, in saying that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, referred to no other law than that of the Jews. This is proved by the words that follow: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whosoever shall do and teach them, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" This applied to the Pharisees, who taught the law in word, while they broke it in deed. Christ says of the Pharisees in another place, \"What they say, that do; but do not after their works: for they say, and do not.\"[fn-17-P1775_1003681:11-nf] So here also He adds, \"For I say unto you, Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven;\"[fn-17-P1776_1003874:12-nf] that is, Unless ye shall both do and teach what they teach without doing, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. This law, therefore, which the Pharisees taught without keeping it, Christ says He came not to destroy, but to fulfill; for this was the law connected with the seat of Moses in which the Pharisees sat, who because they said without doing, are to be heard, but not to be imitated.","title":"Book XVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"4. For which cause our Lord Himself also with His own mouth saith, \"Cleanse what are within, and what are without will be clean.\"[fn-35-P3584_1692456:7-nf] And, also, in another place, when He was refuting the foolish speeches of the Jews, in that they spake evil against His disciples, eating with unwashen hands; \"Not what entereth into the mouth,\" said He, \"defileth the man: but what cometh forth out of the mouth, that defileth the man.\"[fn-35-P3585_1692763:8-nf] Which sentence, if the whole of it be taken of the mouth of the body, is absurd. For neither doth vomit defile him, whom food defileth not. Forsooth food entereth into the mouth, vomit proceedeth forth out of the mouth. But without doubt the former words relate to the mouth of the flesh, where He says, \"Not what entereth into the mouth defileth the man,\" but the latter words to the mouth of the heart, where He saith, \"But what proceedeth forth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.\"[fn-35-P3586_1693270:9-nf] Lastly, when the Apostle Peter sought of Him an explanation of this as of a parable, He answered, \"Are ye also yet without understanding? understand ye not, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?\" Here surely we perceive the mouth of the flesh, into which the food enters. But in what He next adds, in order that we might recognize the mouth of the heart, the slowness of our heart would not follow, did not the Truth deign to walk even with the slow. For He saith, \"But what things go forth from the mouth, go out of the heart;\" as though He should say, When you hear it said \"from the mouth,\" understand \"from the heart.\" I say both, but I set forth one by the other. The inner man hath an inner mouth, and this the inner ear discerns: what things go forth from this mouth, go out of the heart, and they defile the man. Then having left the term mouth, which may be understood also of the body, He shows more openly what He is saying. \"For from the heart go out,\" saith He, \"evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies; these are what defile the man.\" There is surely no one of those evils, which can be committed also by the members of the body, but that the evil thoughts go before and defile the man, although something hinder the sinful and wicked deeds of the body from following. For if, because power is not given, the hand is free from the murder of a man, is the heart of the murderer forsooth therefore clean from sin? Or if she be chaste, whom one unchaste wishes to commit adultery with, hath he on that account failed to commit adultery with her in his heart? Or if the harlot be not found in the brothel, doth he, who seeks her, on that account fail to commit fornication in his heart? Or if time and place be wanting to one who wishes to hurt his neighbor by a lie, hath he on that account failed already to speak false witness with his tuner mouth? Or if any one fearing men, dare not utter aloud blasphemy with tongue of flesh, is he on this account guiltless of this crime, who saith in his heart, \"There is no Coot.\"[fn-35-P3587_1695428:10-nf] Thus all the other evil deeds of men, which no motion of the body performs, of which no sense of the body is conscious, have their own secret criminals, who are also polluted by consent alone in thought, that is, by evil words of the inner mouth. Into which he (the Psalmist) fearing lest his heart should fall aside, asks of the Lord that the door of Continence be set around the lips of this mouth, to contain the heart, that it fall not aside into evil words: but contain it, by not suffering thought to proceed to consent: for thus, according to the precept of the Apostle, sin reigneth not in our mortal body, nor do we yield our members as weapons of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-35-P3588_1696129:11-nf] From fulfilling which precept they are surely far removed, who on this account turn not their members to sin, because no power is allowed them; and if this be present, straightway by the motions of their members, as of weapons, they show, who reigneth in them within. Wherefore so far as is in themselves, they yield their members weapons of unrighteousness unto sin; because this is what they wish, which for this reason they yield not, because they are not able.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_29_homily_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But if to many of the less attentive, it seem yet rather obscure, I will endeavor to explain it from the beginning.

And ye shall begin to hear of wars, and rumours of wars; see that ye be not troubled: for these things must needs come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and earthquakes, and pestilences, in every place. But all these things are the beginnings of travailings. Then they shall deliver you up into affliction, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hateful to all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall arise, and shall seduce many; and because wickedness shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he who shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached through all the world, for a testimony to all nations; and then shall come the end. When, therefore, ye shall see the abomination of desolation which is spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who readeth understand), then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let him which is on the house-roof not go down to take anything from the house; and let him who is in the field not return back to carry away his clothes. But woe to them that are pregnant, and to those that are giving suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath-day: for there shall be great tribulation, such as has not arisen from the beginning of the world until now, neither shall arise. And unless those days should be shortened, no flesh should be saved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. Then if any one shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or, Lo, there; believe him not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, to cause error, if it be possible, even to the elect. But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. If, therefore, they shall say to you, Lo, he is in the desert; go not forth: lo, he is in the sleeping chambers; believe it not. For as the flashing of lightning goeth forth from the east, and appeareth even to the west, so also shall the coming of the Son of man be. Wheresoever the carcase shall be, there shall the eagles be gathered together. But immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be moved: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and all the tribes of the earth shall lament, and shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory. And He shall send His angels with a great trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the heights of heaven, even into the farthest bounds thereof.\"[fn-78-P7866_2637853:87-nf] And these are not new or sudden things which are now happening to Christians; since the good and righteous, and those who are devoted to God in the law of innocence and the fear of true religion, advance always through afflictions, and wrongs, and the severe and manifold penalties of troubles, in the hardship of a narrow path. Thus, at the very beginning of the world, the righteous Abel was the first to be shin by his brother; and Jacob was driven into exile, and Joseph was sold, and king Saul persecuted the merciful David; and king Ahab endeavoured to oppress Elias, who firmly and bravely asserted the majesty of God. Zacharias the priest was slain between the temple and the altar, that himself might there become a sacrifice where he was accustomed to offer sacrifices to God. So many martyrdoms of the righteous have, in fact, often been celebrated; so many examples of faith and virtue have been set forth to future generations. The three youths, Ananias, Azarias, and Misäel, equal in age, agreeing in love, stedfast in faith, constant in virtue, stronger than the flames and penalties that urged them, proclaim that they only obey God, that they know Him alone, that they worship Him alone, saying: \"O king Nebuchodonosor, there is no need for us to answer thee in this matter. For the God whom we serve is able to deliver us out of the furnace of burning fire; and He will deliver us from thy hands, O king. And if not, be it known unto thee, that we do not serve thy gods, and we do not adore the golden image which thou hast set up.\"[fn-78-P7867_2639427:88-nf] And Daniel, devoted to God, and filled with the Holy Spirit, exclaims and says: \"I worship nothing but the Lord my God, who founded the heaven and the earth.\"[fn-78-P7868_2639608:89-nf] Tobias also, although under a royal and tyrannical slavery, yet in feeling and spirit free, maintains his confession to God, and sublimely announces both the divine power and majesty, saying: \"In the land of my captivity I confess to Him, and I show forth His power in a sinful nation.\"[fn-78-P7869_2639924:90-nf] What, indeed, do we find in the Maccabees of seven brethren, equals alike in their lot of birth and virtues, filling up the number seven in the sacrament of a perfected completion? Seven brethren were thus associating in martyrdom. As the first seven days in the divine arrangement containing seven thousand of years,[fn-78-P7870_2640261:91-nf] as the seven spirits and seven angels which stand and go in and out before the face of God, and the seven-branched lamp in the tabernacle of witness, and the seven golden candlesticks in the Apocalypse, and the seven columns in Solomon upon which Wisdom built her house l so here also the number seven of the brethren, embracing, in the quantity of their number, the seven churches, as likewise in the first book of Kings we read that the barren hath borne seven. And in Isaiah seven women lay hold on one man, whose name they ask to be called upon them. And the Apostle Paul, who refers to this lawful and certain number, writes to the seven churches. And in the Apocalypse the Lord directs His divine and heavenly precepts to the seven churches and their angels, which number is now found in this case, in the seven brethren, that a lawful consummation may be completed. With the seven children is manifestly associated also the mother, their origin and root, who subsequently begat seven churches, she herself having been first, and alone founded upon a rock[fn-78-P7871_2641396:92-nf] by the voice of the Lord.[fn-78-P7872_2641526:93-nf] Nor is it of no account that in their sufferings the mother alone is with her children. For martyrs who witness themselves as the sons of God in suffering are now no more counted as of any father but God, as in the Gospel the Lord teaches, saying, \"Call no man your father upon earth; for one is your Father, which is in heaven.\"[fn-78-P7873_2641988:94-nf] ","title":"Treatise XI.

There are, indeed, some men who have a good delivery, but cannot compose anything to deliver. Now, if such men take what has been written with wisdom and eloquence by others, and commit it to memory, and deliver it to the people, they cannot be blamed, supposing them to do it without deception For in this way many become preachers of the truth (which is certainly desirable), and yet not many teachers; for all deliver the discourse which one real teacher has composed, and there are no divisions among them. Nor are such men to be alarmed by the words of Jeremiah the prophet, through whom God denounces those who steal His words every one from his neighbor.[fn-54-P5493_2912325:85-nf] For those who steal take what does not belong to them, but the word of God belongs to all who obey it; and it is the man who speaks well, but lives badly, who really takes the words that belong to another, For the good things he says seem to be the result of his own thought, and yet they have nothing in common with his manner of life. And so God has said that they steal His words who would appear good by speaking God's words, but are in fact bad, as they follow their own ways. And if you look closely into the matter, it is not really themselves who say the good things they say. For how can they say in words what they deny in deeds? It is not for nothing that the apostle says of such men: \"They profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him.\"[fn-54-P5494_2913107:86-nf] In one sense, then, they do say the things, and in another sense they do not say them; for both these statements must be true, both being made by Him who is the Truth. Speaking of such men, in one place He says, \"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works;\"-that is to say, what ye hear from. their lips, that do; what ye see in their lives, that do ye not;-\"for they say and do not.\"[fn-54-P5495_2913552:87-nf] And so, though they do not, yet they say. but in another place, upbraiding such men, He says, \"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?\"[fn-54-P5496_2913736:88-nf] And from this it would appear that even what they say, when they say what is good, it is not themselves who say, for in will and in deed they deny what they say. Hence it happens that a wicked man who is eloquent may compose a discourse in which the truth is set forth to be delivered by a good man who is not eloquent; and when this takes place, the former draws from himself what does not belong to him, and the latter receives from another what really belongs to himself. But when true believers render this service to true believers, both parties speak what is their own, for God is theirs, to whom belongs all that they say; and even those who could not compose what they say make it their own by composing their lives in harmony with it.","title":"Book IV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"39.

This grace we obtain not from the synagogue, which is the mother of Christ after the flesh, but from God the Father.

If it is supposed that God could not enjoin warfare, because in after times it was said by the Lord Jesus Christ, \"I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but if any one strike thee on the right cheek, turn to him the left also,\"[fn-22-P2225_1338094:131-nf] the answer is, that what is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart, and such were the hearts of our fathers, the righteous men of old. But order required such a regulation of events, and such a distinction of times, as to show first of all that even earthly blessings (for so temporal kingdoms and victory over enemies are considered to be, and these are the things which the community of the ungodly all over the world are continually begging from idols and devils) are entirely under the control and at the disposal of the one true God. Thus, under the Old Testament, the secret of the kingdom of heaven, which was to be disclosed in due time, was veiled, and so far obscured, in the disguise of earthly promises. But when the fullness of time came for the revelation of the New Testament, which was hidden under the types of the Old, clear testimony was to be borne to the truth, that there is another life for which this life ought to be disregarded, and another kingdom for which the opposition of all earthly kingdoms should be patiently borne. Thus the name martyrs, which means witnesses, was given to those who, by the will of God, bore this testimony, by their confessions, their sufferings, and their death. The number of such witnesses is so great, that if it pleased Christ-who called Saul by a voice from heaven, and having changed him from a wolf to a sheep, sent him into the midst of wolves-to unite them all in one army, and to give them success in battle, as He gave to the Hebrews, what nation could withstand them? what kingdom would remain unsubdued? But as the doctrine of the New Testament is, that we must serve God not for temporal happiness in this life, but for eternal felicity hereafter, this truth was most strikingly confirmed by the patient endurance of what is commonly called adversity for the sake of that felicity. So in fullness of time the Son of God, made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law, made of the seed of David according to the flesh sends His disciples as sheep into the midst of wolves, and bids them not fear those that can kill the body, but cannot kill the soul, and promises that even the body will be entirely restored, so that not a hair shall be lost.[fn-22-P2226_1340435:132-nf] Peter's sword He orders back into its sheath, restoring as it was before the ear of His enemy that had been cut off. He says that He could obtain legions of angels to destroy His enemies, but that He must drink the cup which His Father's will had given Him.[fn-22-P2227_1340721:133-nf] He sets the example of drinking this cup, then hands it to His followers, manifesting thus, both in word and deed, the grace of patience. Therefore God raised Him from the dead, and has given Him a name which is above every name; that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and of things in earth, and of things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.[fn-22-P2228_1341226:134-nf] The patriarchs and prophets, then, have a kingdom in this world, to show that these kingdoms, too, are given and taken away by God: the apostles and martyrs had no kingdom here, to show the superior desirableness of the kingdom of heaven. The prophets, however, could even in those times die for the truth, as the Lord Himself says, \"From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharia;[fn-22-P2229_1341632:135-nf] and in these days, since the commencement of the fulfillment of what is prophesied in the psalm of Christ, under the figure of Solomon, which means the peacemaker, as Christ is our peace,[fn-22-P2230_1341844:136-nf] \"All kings of the earth shall bow to Him, all nations shall serve Him,\"[fn-22-P2231_1341936:137-nf] we have seen Christian emperors, who have put all their confidence in Christ, gaining splendid victories over ungodly enemies, whose hope was in the rites of idolatry and devil-worship.

Having now gone over all the cases in which Faustus finds fault with the Old Testament, and having attended to the merit of each, either defending men of God against the calumnies of carnal heretics, or, where the men were at fault, showing the excellence and the majesty of Scripture, let us again take the cases in the order of Faustus' accusations, and see the meaning of the actions recorded, what they typify, and what they foretell. This we have already done in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom God said that He was their God, as if the God of universal nature were the God of none besides them; not honoring them with an unmeaning title, but because He, who could alone have a full and perfect knowledge, knew the sincere and remarkable charity of these men; and because these three patriarchs united formed a notable type of the future people of God, in not only having free children by free women, as by Sarah, and Rebecca, and Leah, and Rachel, but also bond children, as of this same Rebecca was born Esau, to whom it was said, \"Thou shalt serve thy brother;\"[fn-22-P2248_1357079:148-nf] and in having by bond women not only bond children, as by Hagar, but also free children, as by Bilhah and Zilphah. Thus also in the people of God, those spiritually free not only have children born into the enjoyment of liberty, like those to whom it is said, \"Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ\"[fn-22-P2249_1357410:149-nf] but they have also children born into guilty bondage, as Simon was born of Philip.[fn-22-P2250_1357515:150-nf] Again, from carnal bondmen are born not only children of guilty bondage, who imitate them, but also children of happy liberty, to whom it is said, \"What they say, do; but do not after their works.\"[fn-22-P2251_1357735:151-nf] Whoever rightly observes the fulfillment of this type in the people of God, keeps the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, by continuing to the end in union with some, and in patient endurance of others.

To this we must reply that it is the conviction of men who are wise in Christ, who have profited by those epistles which are current, and who see them to be vouched for by the testimonies deposited in the law and the prophets,[fn-61-P6118_933756:11-nf] that the apostolic writings are to be pronounced wise and worthy of belief, and that they have great authority, but that they are not on the same level with that \"Thus sayeth the Lord Almighty.\"[fn-61-P6119_933996:12-nf] Consider on this point the language of St. Paul. When he declares that[fn-61-P6120_934087:13-nf] \"Every Scripture is inspired of God and profitable,\" does he include his own writings? Or does he not include his dictum,[fn-61-P6121_934230:14-nf] \"I say, and not the Lord,\" and[fn-61-P6122_934282:15-nf] \"So I ordain in all the churches,\" and[fn-61-P6123_934342:16-nf] \"What things I suffered at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra,\" and similar things which he writes in virtue of his own authority, and which do not quite possess the character of words flowing from divine inspiration. Must we also show that the old Scripture is not Gospel, since it does not point out the Coming One, but only foretells Him and heralds His coming at a future time; but that all the new Scripture is the Gospel. It not only says as in the beginning of the Gospel,[fn-61-P6124_934839:17-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world; \"it also contains many praises of Him, and many of His teachings, on whose account the Gospel is a Gospel. Again, if God set in the Church[fn-61-P6125_935060:18-nf] apostles and prophets and evangelists (gospellers), pastors and teachers, we must first enquire what was the office of the evangelist, and mark that it is not only to narrate how the Saviour cured a man who was blind from his birth,[fn-61-P6126_935313:19-nf] or raised up a dead man who was already stinking,[fn-61-P6127_935380:20-nf] or to state what extraordinary works he wrought; and the office of the evangelist being thus defined, we shall not hesitate to find Gospel in such discourse also as is not narrative but hortatory and intended to strengthen belief in the mission of Jesus; and thus we shall arrive at the position that whatever was written by the Apostles is Gospel. As to this second definition, it might be objected that the Epistles are not entitled \"Gospel,\" and that we are wrong in applying the name of Gospel to the whole of the New Testament. But to this we answer that it happens not unfrequently in Scripture when two or more persons or things are named by the same name, the name attaches itself most significantly to one of those things or persons. Thus the Saviour says,[fn-61-P6128_936164:21-nf] \"Call no man Master upon the earth; \"while the Apostle says that Masters[fn-61-P6129_936260:22-nf] have been appointed in the Church. These latter accordingly will not be Masters in the strict sense of the dictum of the Gospel. In the same way the Gospel in the Epistles will not extend to every word of them, when it is compared with the narrative of Jesus' actions and sufferings and discourses. No: the Gospel is the first fruits of all Scripture, and to these first fruits of the Scriptures we devote the first fruits of all those actions of ours which we trust to see turn out as we desire.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":23,"verse":38,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"ANF-06","text":"XII. And in addition to this, when besides the spectacle, and even beyond the spectacle, they heard an old man, very righteous, very worthy of credit, worthy also of emulation, inspired by the Holy Spirit, a teacher of the law, honoured with the priesthood, illustrious in the gift of prophecy, by the hope which he had conceived of Christ, extending the limits of life, and putting off the debt of death-when they saw him, I say, leaping for joy, speaking words of good omen, quite transformed with gladness of heart, entirely rapt in a divine and holy ecstasy; who from a man had been changed into an angel by a godly change, and, for the immensity of his joy, chanted his hymn of thanksgiving, and openly proclaimed the \"Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.\"[fn-61-P6124_1881804:105-nf] Not even then were they willing to hear what was placed within their hearing, and held in veneration by the heavenly beings themselves; wherefore the house in which they boasted was filled with smoke.

Peter, our holy master, and the prince of the apostles, was translated for the sake of the common good from Antioch to Rome, in order that he might be in a position there of doing more service. Eusebius also was transferred from a certain minor city to Alexandria by apostolic authority. In like manner Felix, on account of the doctrine and the good life which he maintained, was translated by the common consent of the bishops and the other priests, and the people from the city in which, on the election of the citizens, he had been ordained, to Ephesus. For that man is not chargeable with shifting from city to city who does not do that of his own inclination or by the force of ambition, but who is transferred for the general good, or in virtue of some necessity, by the counsel and with the consent of the chief parties. Nor can he be said to transfer himself from a smaller city to a larger, who is placed in that position not by his own self-seeking or his own choice, but either as being driven out of his own proper seat by force, or as being compelled by some necessity, and who without pride and in humility has been translated and installed there by others for the good of the place or the people: for man looketh on the countenance, but the Lord seeth the heart. And the Lord, speaking by the prophet, says, \"The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vanity.\"[fn-91-P9151_2967926:4-nf] That man, therefore, does not change his seat who does not change his mind. Nor does he change his city who is changed not of his own will, but by the decision and election of others. And accordingly he does not shift from city to city who does not leave his own city for the sake of gain to himself, or of his own choice, but who, as has already been said, has been translated to another city either in consequence of being driven out of his own seat, or compelled by some necessity, or in virtue of the election and injunction of the priests and people. For as the bishops have power regularly to ordain bishops and other orders of priests, so, as often as any matter of advantage or necessity constrains them, they have power in the above-mentioned manner both to transfer and to install. As ye have asked our opinion in these matters, though they are not subjects unknown to you, we give you these things in charge to hold them, lest, through the ignorance of some, that which is better and more profitable be avoided, and what is more profitless be taken up, even as we read in the holy Gospel: \"Woe unto you, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides, which strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.\"[fn-91-P9152_2969326:5-nf] What is lawful is with them not lawful, and what is not lawful is lawful. Even as Jannes and Mambres[fn-91-P9153_2969451:6-nf] resisted the truth, so do they, being reprobate in mind, and lovers of pleasure rather than of God, teach that that is unlawful which is lawful, to wit, that bishops should shift from city to city in the manner already noted; and what is unlawful they teach as lawful, to wit, to omit to show mercy to those who endure straits: that is to say, theft deny that a bishop belonging to another city should be bestowed for good, or for necessity's sake, upon those who have no bishop, and who want the sacred episcopal ministry; and that another episcopal seat should be assigned to bishops who endure persecution or straits.

It was not, then, without a purpose that these fishes were described as so many in number, and so large in size, that is, as both an hundred and fifty-three, and large. For so it is written, \"And He drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty andthree.\" For when the Lord said, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill \"because about to give the Spirit, through whom the law might be fulfilled, and to add thereby, as it were, seven to ten; after interposing a few other words He proceeded, \"Whosoevertherefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shallbe called the least in the kingdom of heaven: ] but whosoever shall do and teach them. thesame shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

But he that is the least, who undoes in deed what he teaches in word, may be in such a church as is signified by that first capture of fishes, which contains both good and bad, for it also is called the kingdom of heaven, as He says, \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of ever kind;\"[fn-38-P3864_2127258:20-nf] where He wishes the good as well as the bad to be understood, and of whom He declares that they are yet to be separated on the shore, to wit, at the end of the world. And lastly, to show that those least ones are reprobates who teach by word of mouth the good which they undo by their evil lives, and that they will not be even the least, as it were, in the life that is eternal, but will have no place there at all; after saying, \"He shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven,\" He immediately added, \"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-38-P3865_2127952:21-nf] Such, doubtless-these scribes and Pharisees-are those who sit in Moses' seat, and of whom He says, \"Do ye what they gay, but do not what they do; for they say, and do not.\"[fn-38-P3866_2128146:22-nf] They teach in sermons what they undo by their morals. It therefore follows that he who is least in the kingdom of heaven, as the Church now exists, shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, as the Church shall be hereafter; for by teaching what he himself is in the habit of breaking, he can have no place in the company of those who do what they teach, and therefore will not be in the number of great fishes, seeing it is he \"who shall do and teach that shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" And because he will be great here, therefore shall he be there, where he that is least shall not be. Yea, so great will they certainly be there, that he who is less there is greater than the greatest here.[fn-38-P3867_2128883:23-nf] And yet those who are great here, that is, who do the good that they teach in that kingdom of heaven into which the net gathereth good and bad, shall be greater still in that eternal state of the heavenly kingdom,-those, I mean, who are indicated by the fishes here as belonging to the right hand and to the resurrection of life. We have still to discourse, as God shall grant us ability, on the meal that the Lord took with those seven disciples, and on the words He spake after the meal, as well as on the close of the Gospel itself; but these are topics that cannot be included in the present lecture.

Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their sins, men meanwhile steal the intervening time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time[fn-113-P11330_3212277:48-nf] for sinning, rather than a time for learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of sins (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price. For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award pardon: He proposes the redemption[fn-113-P11331_3212703:49-nf] of release from penalty at this compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated,[fn-113-P11332_3212927:50-nf] we believe likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of eternal life, first institutes a probation of our repentance. \"But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.\"[fn-113-P11333_3213259:51-nf] By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while the penitent does not yet merit-so far as merit we can-his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts and desertions? What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan himself before receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the divine benefit-the putting away of sins, I mean-is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say? \"Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.\"[fn-113-P11334_3214534:52-nf] Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please over your deeds, \"God is light.\"[fn-113-P11335_3214631:53-nf] But some think as if God were under a necessity of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the symbol of death,[fn-113-P11336_3214872:54-nf] then He does so unwilling. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted unwillingly? For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this gift taken away from many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the faith of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the \"recruit-classes\" of learners, as if on that account he have a licence even now to sin. As soon as you \"know the Lord,[fn-113-P11337_3215496:55-nf] you should fear Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does your \"knowing\" Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in days bygone, when you knew Him not? What, moreover, is it which distinguishes you from a perfected[fn-113-P11338_3215821:56-nf] servant of God? Is there one Christ for the baptized, another for the learners? Have they some different hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different necessity for repentance? That baptismal washing is a sealing of faith, which faith is begun and is commended by the faith of repentance. We are not washed in order that we may cease sinning, but because we have ceased, since in heart we have been bathed[fn-113-P11339_3216269:57-nf] already. For the first baptism of a learner is this, a perfect fear;[fn-113-P11340_3216382:58-nf] thenceforward, in so far as you have understanding of the Lord faith is sound, the conscience having once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the baptismal waters that we cease sinning, it is of necessity, not of free-will, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pro-eminent in goodness? he who is not allowed, or he whom it displeases, to be evil? he who is bidden, or he whose pleasure it is, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our persons, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism. But if any entertain this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more sadness to think that he has ceased from sinning, than gladness that he hath escaped from it. And so it is becoming that learners desire baptism, but do not hastily receive it: for he who desires it, honours it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended, except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of true repentance? for he has feared to continue still in sin, lest he should not merit the reception of baptism. But the hasty receiver, inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it), could not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is, fear.[fn-113-P11341_3218238:59-nf] Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver. And thus it sometimes deceives,[fn-113-P11342_3218376:60-nf] for it promises to itself the gift before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish the gift is ever offended.","title":"On Repentance.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":23,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_47_on_repentance_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-03","text":"This if you doubt, unravel[fn-113-P11359_3223232:70-nf] the meaning of \"what the Spirit saith to the churches.\" He imputes to the Ephesians \"forsaken love; \"[fn-113-P11360_3223372:71-nf] reproaches the Thyatirenes with \"fornication,\" and \"eating of things sacrificed to idols; \"[fn-113-P11361_3223481:72-nf] accuses the Sardians of \"works not full; \"[fn-113-P11362_3223542:73-nf] censures the Pergamenes for teaching perverse things;[fn-113-P11363_3223614:74-nf] upbraids the Laodiceans for trusting to their riches;[fn-113-P11364_3223690:75-nf] and yet gives them all general monitions to repentance-under comminations, it is true; but He would not utter comminations to one unrepentant if He did not forgive the repentant.

For they regard the weaknesses in Him as if they were a man's weaknesses, but they do not count the powers as if they were a God's powers. They keep in mind the infirmities of the flesh, they exclude the powers of the divinity; when if this argument from the infirmities of Christ is of avail to the result of proving Him to be man from His infirmities, the argument of divinity in Him gathered from His powers avails to the result also of asserting Him to be God from His works. For if His sufferings show in Him human frailty, why may not His works assert in Him divine power? For if this should not avail to assert Him to be God from His powers, neither can His sufferings avail to show Him to be man also from them. For whatever principle be adopted on one or the other side, will be found to be maintained.[fn-101-P10194_3175289:71-nf] For there will be a risk that He should not be shown to be man from His sufferings, if He could not also be approved as God by His powers.

For Scripture as much announces Christ as also God, as it announces God Himself as man. It has as much described Jesus Christ to be man, as moreover it has also described Christ the Lord to be God. Because it does not set forth Him to be the Son of God only, but also the Son of man; nor does it only say, the Son of man, but it has also been accustomed to speak of Him as the Son of God. So that being of both, He is both, lest if He should be one only, He could not be the other. For as nature itself has prescribed that he must be believed to be a man who is of man, so the same nature prescribes also that He must be believed to be God who is of God; but if he should not also be God when be is of God, no more should he be man although he should be of man. And thus both doctrines would be endangered in one and the other way, by one being convicted to have lost belief in the other. Let them, therefore, who read that Jesus Christ the Son of man is man, read also that this same Jesus is called also God and the Son of God. For in the manner that as man He is of Abraham, so also as God He is before Abraham himself. And in the same manner as He is as man the \"Son of David,\"[fn-101-P10195_3176796:72-nf] so as God He is proclaimed David's Lord. And in the same manner as He was made as man \"under the law,\"[fn-101-P10196_3176929:73-nf] so as God He is declared to be \"Lord of the Sabbath.\"[fn-101-P10197_3177001:74-nf] And in the same manner as He suffers, as man, the condemnation, so as God He is found to have all judgment of the quick and dead. And in the same manner as He is born as man subsequent to the world, so as God He is manifested to have been before the world. And in the same way as He was begotten as man of the seed of David, so also the world is said to have been ordained by Him as God. And in the same way as He was as man after many, so as God He was before all. And in the same manner as He was as man inferior to others, so as God He was greater than all. And in the same manner as He ascended as man into heaven, so as God He had first descended thence. And in the same manner as He goes as man to the Father, so as the Son in obedience to the Father He shall descend thence. So if imperfections in Him prove human frailty, majesties in Him affirm divine power. For the risk is, in reading of both, to believe not both, but one of the two. Wherefore as both are read of in Christ, let both be believed; that so finally the faith may be true, being also complete. For if of two principles one gives way in the faith, and the other, and that indeed which is of least importance, be taken up for belief, the rule of truth is thrown into confusion; and that boldness will not confer salvation, but instead of salvation will effect a great risk of death from the overthrow of the faith.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":23,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And now, indeed, concerning the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, let it be sufficient to have briefly said thus much, and to have laid down these points concisely, without carrying them out in a lengthened argument. For they could be presented more diffusely and continued in a more expanded disputation, since the whole of the Old and New Testaments might be adduced in testimony that thus the true faith stands. But because heretics, ever struggling against the truth, are accustomed to prolong the controversy of pure tradition and Catholic faith, being offended against Christ; because He is, moreover, asserted to be God by the Scriptures also, and this is believed to be so by us; we must rightly-that every heretical calumny may be removed from our faith-contend, concerning the fact that Christ is God also, in such a way as that it may not militate against the truth of Scripture; nor yet against our faith, how there is declared to be one God by the Scriptures, and how it is held and believed by us. For as well they who say that Jesus Christ Himself is God the Father, as moreover they who would have Him to be only man, have gathered thence[fn-104-P10447_3290705:266-nf] the sources and reasons of their error and perversity; because when they perceived that it was written[fn-104-P10448_3290837:267-nf] that \"God is one,\" they thought that they could not otherwise hold such an opinion than by supposing that it must be believed either that Christ was man only, or really God the Father. And they were accustomed in such a way to connect their sophistries as to endeavour to justify their own error. And thus they who say that Jesus Christ is the Father argue as follows:-If God is one, and Christ is God, Christ is the Father, since God is one. If Christ be not the Father, because Christ is God the Son, there appear to be two Gods introduced, contrary to the Scriptures. And they who contend that Christ is man only, conclude on the other hand thus:-If the Father is one, and the Son another, but the Father is God and Christ is God, then there is not one God, but two Gods are at once introduced, the Father and the Son; and if God is one, by consequence Christ must be a man, so that rightly the Father may be one God. Thus indeed the Lord is, as it were, crucified between two thieves,[fn-104-P10449_3291864:268-nf] even as He was formerly placed; and thus from either side He receives the sacrilegious reproaches of such heretics as these. But neither the Holy Scriptures nor we suggest to them the reasons of their perdition and blindness, if they either will not, or cannot, see what is evidently written in the midst of the divine documents. For we both know, and read, and believe, and maintain that God is one, who made the heaven as well as the earth, since we neither know any other, nor shall we at any time know such, seeing that there is none. \"I,\" says He, \"am God, and there is none beside me, righteous and a Saviour.\"[fn-104-P10450_3292598:269-nf] And in another place: \"I am the first and the last, and beside me there is no God who is as I.\"[fn-104-P10451_3292718:270-nf] And, \"Who hath meted out heaven with a Span, and the earth with a handful? Who has suspended the mountains in a balance, and the woods on scales? \"[fn-104-P10452_3292890:271-nf] And Hezekiah: \"That all may know that Thou art God alone.\"[fn-104-P10453_3292970:272-nf] Moreover, the Lord Himself: \"Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? God alone is good.\"[fn-104-P10454_3293094:273-nf] Moreover, the Apostle Paul says: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light that no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see.\"[fn-104-P10455_3293272:274-nf] And in another place: \"But a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.\"[fn-104-P10456_3293376:275-nf] But even as we hold, and read, and believe this, thus we ought to pass over no portion of the heavenly Scriptures, since indeed also we ought by no means to reject those marks of Christ's divinity which are laid down in the Scriptures, that we may not, by corrupting the authority of the Scriptures, be held to have corrupted the integrity of our holy faith. And let us therefore believe this, since it is most faithful that Jesus Christ the Son of God is our Lord and God; because \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God.\"[fn-104-P10457_3294002:276-nf] And, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us.\"[fn-104-P10458_3294072:277-nf] And, \"My Lord and my God.\"[fn-104-P10459_3294119:278-nf] And, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom according to the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for evermore.\"[fn-104-P10460_3294261:279-nf] What, then, shall we say? Does Scripture set before us two Gods? How, then, does it say that \"God is one? \"Or is not Christ God also? How, then, is it said to Christ,\" My Lord and my God? \"Unless, therefore, we hold all this with fitting veneration and lawful argument, we shall reasonably be thought to have furnished a scandal to the heretics, not assuredly by the fault of the heavenly Scriptures, which never deceive; but by the presumption of human error, whereby they have chosen to be heretics. And in the first place, we must turn the attack against them who undertake to make against us the charge of saying that there are two Gods. It is written, and they cannot deny it, that \"there is one Lord.\"[fn-104-P10461_3294989:280-nf] What, then, do they think of Christ?-that He is Lord, or that He is not Lord at all? But they do not doubt absolutely that He is Lord; therefore, if their reasoning be true, here are already two Lords. How, then, is it true according to the Scriptures, there is one Lord? And Christ is called the \"one Master.\"[fn-104-P10462_3295322:281-nf] Nevertheless we read that the Apostle Paul also is a master.[fn-104-P10463_3295410:282-nf] Then, according to this, our Master is not one, for from these things we conclude that there are two masters. How, then, according to the Scriptures, is \"one our Master, even Christ? \"In the Scriptures there is one \"called good, even God; \"but in the same Scriptures Christ is also asserted to be good. There is not, then, if they rightly conclude, one good, but even two good. How, then, according to the scriptural faith, is there said to be only one good? But if they do not think that it can by any means interfere with the truth that there is one Lord, that Christ also is Lord, nor with the truth that one is our. Master, that Paul also is our master, or with the truth that one is good, that Christ also is called good; on the same reasoning, let them understand that, from the fact that God is one, no obstruction arises to the truth that Christ also is declared to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":23,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"ANF-02","text":"But most of all is it necessary to wash the soul in the cleansing Word (sometimes the body too, on account of the dirt which gathers and grows to it, sometimes also to relieve fatigue). \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\" saith the Lord, \"for ye are like to whited sepulchres.

But the first cause of the universe was not previously known to the Greeks; neither, accordingly, to Thales, who came to the conclusion that water was the first i cause; nor to the other natural philosophers who succeeded him, since it was Anaxagoras who was the first who assigned to Mind the supremacy over material things.

For that He did not say this with reference to the acknowledging of the Stauros (cross) above, as some among them venture to expound, but with respect to the suffering which He should Himself undergo, and that His disciples should endure, He implies when He says, \"For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose, shall find it.

What the crier says, will never be attributed to him if he speak in the presence of the judge.

And so whether he will or no, must he proclaim the sentence of the acquittal even of his own enemy. Suppose him to speak from his heart; lie acquits his friend, and punishes his enemy. Suppose him to speak from the judge's chair; he punishes his friend, and acquits his enemy.

For so embracing both judgments of the Lord, thou wilt not be obedient in the one, and guilty of disobedience in the other; but wilt understand that both agree together, and wilt regard both that as true, \"that a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things;\" and that other also, that those Scribes did not speak good things out of the evil treasure of their heart, but that they were able to speak good things out of the treasure of Moses' seat.","title":"Sermon XXIV.

And when we find that in those times, when the point in question was decided in a manner contrary to ancient custom, after discussions carried on without violation of saving charity and unity, it appeared to some even eminent men who were bishops of Christ, among whom the blessed Cyprian was specially conspicuous, that the baptism of Christ could not exist among heretics or schismatics, this simply arose from their not distinguishing the sacrament from the effect or use of the sacrament; and because its effect and use were not found among heretics in freeing them from their sins and setting their hearts right, the sacrament itself was also thought to be wanting among them. But if we turn our eyes to the multitude of chaff within the Church, since these also who are perverse and lead an abandoned life in unity itself appear to have no power either of giving or retaining remission of sins, seeing that it is not to the wicked but the good sons that it was said, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained,\"[fn-38-P3844_2110399:1-nf] yet that such persons both have, and give, and receive the sacrament of baptism, was sufficiently manifest to the pastors of the Catholic Church dispersed over the whole world, through whom the original custom was afterwards confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council; so that even the sheep which was straying outside, and had received the mark of the Lord from false plunderers outside, if it seek the salvation of Christian unity, is purified from error, is freed from captivity, is healed of its wound, and yet the mark of the Lord is recognized rather than rejected in it; since the mark itself is often impressed both by wolves and on wolves, who seem indeed to be within the fold, but yet are proved by the fruits of their conduct, in which they persevere even to the end, not to belong to that sheep which is one in many; because, according to the foreknowledge of God, as many sheep wander outside, so many wolves lurk treacherously within, among whom the Lord yet knoweth them that are His, which hear only the voice of the Shepherd, even when He calls by the voice of men like the Pharisees, of whom it was said, \"Whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do.\"[fn-38-P3845_2111599:2-nf] ","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_61_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Quod enim apparet homo generatus, hoc valet seminis dejectio.

For if the flesh were not in a position to be saved, the Word of God would in no wise have become flesh. And if the blood of the righteous were not to be inquired after, the Lord would certainly not have had blood [in His composition]. But inasmuch as blood cries out (vocalis est) from the beginning [of the world], God said to Cain, when he had slain his brother, \"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to Me.\"[fn-90-P9088_2626749:115-nf] And as their blood will be inquired after, He said to those with Noah, \"For your blood of your souls will I require, [even] from the hand of all beasts; \"[fn-90-P9089_2626924:116-nf] and again, \"Whosoever will shed man's blood,[fn-90-P9090_2626996:117-nf] it shall be shed for his blood.\" In like manner, too, did the Lord say to those who should afterwards shed His blood, \"All righteous blood shall be required which is shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.\"[fn-90-P9091_2627464:118-nf] He thus points out the recapitulation that should take place in his own person of the effusion of blood from the beginning, of all the righteous men and of the prophets, and that by means of Himself there should be a requisition of their blood. Now this [blood] could not be required unless it also had the capability of being saved; nor would the Lord have summed up these things in Himself, unless He had Himself been made flesh and blood after the way of the original formation [of man], saving in his own person at the end that which had in the beginning perished in Adam.","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":23,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_60_book_i_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"8.

For the man who does not content himself with hearing the words with his ear, but considers the meaning of the phrase, when he hears, \"What we look to is the conscience of the giver, that it may cleanse the conscience of the recipient,\" will answer, The conscience of man is often unknown to me, but I am certain of the mercy of Christ: when he hears, \"He who receives faith from the faithless receives not faith, but guilt,\" will answer, Christ is not faithless, from whom I receive not guilt, but faith: when he hears, \"Everything consists of an origin and root; and if it have not something for a head, is nothing,\" will answer, My origin is Christ, my root is Christ, my head is Christ.

But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said by Truth and by the Catholic Church, that not only when the minister of baptism is evil, but also when he is holy and good, hope is still not to be placed in man, but in Him that justifieth the ungodly, in whom if any man believe, his faith is counted for righteousness.[fn-57-P5795_2802999:105-nf] For when we say, Christ baptizes, we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes, or would have men think that he believes, to be our meaning, but by a hidden grace, by a hidden power in the Holy Spirit as it is said of Him by John the Baptist, \"The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-57-P5796_2803331:106-nf] Nor has He, as Petilianus says, now ceased to baptize; but He still does it, not by any ministry of the body, but by the invisible working of His majesty. For in that we say, He Himself baptizes, we do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the water the bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses, and that He does to the whole Church without exception.

But the passages which I have advanced to assert the truth of the Catholic Church,, are the following: As regards the question of baptism, that our being born again, cleansed, justified by the grace of God, should not be ascribed to the man who administered the sacrament, I quoted these: \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man:\"[fn-58-P5810_2808447:115-nf] and \"Cursed be every one that trusteth in man;\"[fn-58-P5811_2808517:116-nf] and that, \"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord;\"[fn-58-P5812_2808585:117-nf] and that, \"Vain is the help of man;\"[fn-58-P5813_2808641:118-nf] and that, \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase;\"[fn-58-P5814_2808770:119-nf] and that He in whom men believe justifieth the ungodly, that his faith may be counted to him for righteousness.[fn-58-P5815_2808904:120-nf] But in behalf of the unity of the Church itself, which is spread abroad throughout all the world, with which you do not hold communion, I urged that the following passages were prophesied of Christ: that \"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth;\"[fn-58-P5816_2809221:121-nf] and, \"I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession;\"[fn-58-P5817_2809359:122-nf] and that the covenant of God made with Abraham may be quoted in behalf of our, that is, of the Catholic communion, in which it is written, \"In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed;\"[fn-58-P5818_2809573:123-nf] which seed the apostle interprets, saying, \"And to thy seed, which is Christ.\"[fn-58-P5819_2809674:124-nf] Whence it is evident that in Christ not only Africans or Africa, but all the nations through which the Catholic Church is spread abroad, should receive the blessing which was promised so long before.

I suppose, brethren, that this is known in the Church, and that what we are saying is manifest by daily examples; but let us consider these things in the case of our fathers before us, how they also had these four kinds. Of the good, good; Ananias baptized Paul. How of the evil, evil? The apostle declares that there were certain preachers of the gospel, who, he says, did not use to preach the gospel with a pure motive, whom, however, he tolerates in the Christian society, saying, \"What then, notwithstanding every way, whether by occasion or in truth, Christ is preached, and in this I rejoice.\"[fn-7-P725_354405:18-nf] Was he therefore malevolent, and did he rejoice in another's evil?

No other bird, when it is a mother, is recognized at once to be so. We see all kinds of sparrows building their nests before our eyes; we see swallows, storks, doves, every day building their nests; but we do not know them to be parents, except when we see them on their nests. But the hen is so enfeebled over her brood, that even if the chickens are not following her, if thou see not the young ones, yet thou knowest her at once to be a mother. With her wings drooping, her feathers ruffled, her note hoarse, in all her limbs she becomes so sunken and abject, that, as I have said, even though thou seest not her young, yet thou perceivest her to be a mother. In such manner was Jesus weak, wearied with His journey. His journey is the flesh assumed for us. For how can He, who is present everywhere, have a journey, He who is nowhere absent? Whither does He go, or whence, but that He could not come to us, except He had assumed the form of visible flesh? Therefore, as He deigned to come to us in such manner, that He appeared in the form of a servant by the flesh assumed, that same assumption of flesh is His journey.

For without this that theoretical purity of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only,-who are perfected not by the words of others who teach them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after much expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their knowledge not from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing with the Psalmist: \"From Thy commandments I have understanding;\" and having overcome all their passions, they say with confidence: \"I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.\"[fn-54-P5496_1967282:22-nf] For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm, understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart a holy tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge yourselves from the stain of all sins, and rid yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an impossibility for the soul which is taken up even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of knowledge or to become an author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading holy things. Be careful therefore in the first place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather to be careful about what I am going to say-that you may enjoin absolute silence on your lips, in order that your zeal for reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed by vain pride. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them. For from teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of spiritual knowledge will flourish. And so you should never venture to say anything in the conference of the Elders unless some ignorance that might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to know leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory, pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the knowledge which they perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the praise of men, to be rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one who is bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults, and especially to that of pride: and so if he is baffled by his enCounter with practical and ethical knowledge, he will certainly not attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be then in all things \"swift to hear, but slow to speak,\"[fn-54-P5497_1969421:23-nf] lest there come upon you that which is noted by Solomon: \"If thou seest a man who is quick to speak, know that there is more hope of a fool than of him;[fn-54-P5498_1969595:24-nf] and do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not already performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we ought to keep to this order, as of Him it is said: \"what Jesus began to do and to teach.\"[fn-54-P5499_1969853:25-nf] Take care then that you do not rush into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those of whom the Lord speaks inthe gospel to the disciples: \"What they sayunto you, that observe and do, but not aftertheir words: for they say and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to beborne, and lay them on men's shoulders; butthey themselves will not move them with oneof their fingers.\"[fn-55-P5500_1970280:26-nf] For if he who shall \"breakone of these commands, and shall teach menso, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-55-P5501_1970428:27-nf] it follows that one who has dared to despise many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall certainly be considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest in the punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul on profound and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of man's, nor condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of the illumination of the Holy Ghost.","title":"XIV.

And so the Lord in reference to their pride said immediately, \"Beware of the Scribes which love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first rooms at feasts.\"[fn-49-P4918_2107661:18-nf] Not because they hold them, but because they love them. For in these words he accused their heart. Now none can accuse the heart, but He who can inspect it. For meet it is that to the servant of God, who holds some post of honour in the Church, the first place should be assigned; because if it were not given him, it were evil for him who refuses to give it; but yet it is no good to him to whom it is given. It is meet and right then that in the congregation of Christians their Prelates[fn-49-P4919_2108186:19-nf] should sit in eminent place, that by their very seat they may be distinguished, and that their office may be duly marked; yet not so that they should be puffed up for their seat; but that they should esteem it a burden, for which they are to render an account. But who knows whether they love this, or do not love it? This is a matter of the heart, it can have no other judge but God. Now the Lord Himself warned His disciples, that they should not fall into this leaven; as He calls it in another place, \"Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\"[fn-49-P4920_2108779:20-nf] And when they supposed that He said this to them because they had brought no bread; He answered them, \"Have ye forgotten how many thousands were filled with the five loaves? Then understood they,\" it is said, \"that He called their doctrine leaven.\"[fn-49-P4921_2109047:21-nf] For these present temporal good things they loved, but they neither feared the evil things eternal, nor loved the good things eternal.

Hearken to the hirelings as pointed out by the Lord Himself: \"The scribes,\" He saith, \"and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: do what they say; but do not what they do.\"[fn-19-P1992_1234795:15-nf] What else said He but, Listen to the Shepherd's voice speaking through the hirelings? For sitting in Moses' seat, they teach the law of God; therefore God teacheth by them. But if they wish to teach their own things, hear them not, do them not. For certainly such seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's; but no hireling has dared to say to Christ's people, Seek your own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. For his own evil conduct he does not preach from the seat of Christ: he does injury by the evil that he does, not by the good that he says. Pluck the grapes, beware of the thorn. It is well I see that you have understood; but for the sake of those that are slower, I shall repeat these words with greater plainness. How said I, Pluck the bunch of grapes, beware of the thorn; when the Lord saith, \"Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles\"? That is quite true: and yet what I said is also true, Pluck the bunch of grapes, beware of the thorn. For sometimes the grape-cluster, springing from the root of the vine, finds its support in a common hedge; its branch, grows, becomes embedded among thorns, and the thorn bears other fruit than its own. For the thorn has not been produced from the vine, but has become the resting-place of its runner. Make thine inquiries only at the roots. Seek for the thorn-root, thou wilt find it apart from the vine: seek the origin of the grape, and from the root of the vine it will be found to have sprung. And so, Moses' seatwas the vine; the morals of the Pharisees werethe thorns. Sound doctrine cometh through the wicked, as the vine-branch in a hedge, a bunch of grapes among thorns. Gather care. fully, so as in seeking the fruit not to tear thine hand; and while thou art to hear one speaking what is good, imitate him not when doing what is evil. \"What they tell you, do,\"-gather the grapes; \"but what they do, do not,\"-beware of the thorns. Even through hirelings listen to the voice of the Shepherd, but be not hirelings yourselves, seeing ye are members of the Shepherd. Yea, Paul himself, the holy apostle who said, \"I have noone who hath a brother's concern about you; for all seek their own, not the things which l are Jesus Christ's,\" draws a distinction in another place between hirelings and sons; and see what he saith: \"Some preach Christ even of envy and strife, and some also of good will: some of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel; but some also preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds.\" These were hirelings who disliked the Apostle Paul. And why such dislike, but just because they were seeking after temporal things? But mark what he adds: \"What then, notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached: and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.\"[fn-19-P1993_1237671:16-nf] Christ is the truth: let the truth be preached in pretense by hirelings, let it be preached in truth by the children: the children are waiting patiently for the eternal inheritance of the Father, the hirelings are longing for, and in a hurry to get, the temporal pay of their employer. For my part let me be shorn of the human glory, which I see such an object of envy to hirelings: and yet by the tongues both of hirelings and of children let the divine glory of Christ be published abroad, seeing that, \"whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached.\"","title":"Tractate XLVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_25_the_first_epistle_of_the_blessed_clement","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Such are the ways of all those who do not work, but go hunting for tales, and think to themselves that this is profitable and right.[fn-10-P1043_261806:94-nf] For such persons are like those idle and prating widows \"who go wandering about[fn-10-P1044_261924:95-nf] among houses\"[fn-10-P1045_261971:96-nf] with their prating, and hunt for idle tales, and carry them from house to house with much exaggeration, without fear of God.

The judges said: Speak to those points, Archelaus, which he has just now propounded. Archelaus said: By the prince of the world, and the wicked one, and darkness, and death, he means one and the same thing, and alleges that the law has been given by that being, on the ground of the scriptural statement that it is \"the ministration of death,\" as well as on the ground of other things which he has urged against it. Well, then, I say[fn-35-P3532_967301:265-nf] that since, as wehave explained above, the law which was written naturally on men's hearts did not keep carefully by the memory of evil things, and since there was not a sufficiently established tradition among the elders, inasmuch as hostile oblivion always attached itself to the memory,[fn-35-P3533_967750:266-nf] and one man was instructed in the knowledge of that law by master, and another by himself, it easily came about that transgressions of the law engraved by nature did take place, and that through the violation of the commandments death obtained its kingship among men. For the race of men is of such a nature, that it needs to be ruled by God with a rod of iron. And so death triumphed and reigned with all its power on to Moses, even over those who had not sinned, in the way which we have explained: over sinners indeed, as these were its proper objects, and under subjection to it,-men after the type of Cain and Judas;[fn-35-P3534_968532:267-nf] but also over the righteous, because they refused to consent to it, and rather withstood it, by putting away from themselves the vices and concupiscence of lusts,-men like those who have arisen at times from Abel on to Zacharias;[fn-35-P3535_968795:268-nf] -death thus always passing, up to the time of Moses, upon those after that similitude.[fn-35-P3536_968906:269-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":23,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-06","text":"42. But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary to Moses. And first, as to the word, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-37-P3743_1051433:461-nf] -that is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\"[fn-37-P3744_1051836:462-nf] But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just[fn-37-P3745_1051932:463-nf] that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then, to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence [fn-37-P3746_1052606:464-nf] of goodness, indeed, when one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, \"I make the rich man and the poor man,\"[fn-37-P3747_1052946:465-nf] whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.[fn-37-P3748_1053006:466-nf] Well, in that saying Jesus did; not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed[fn-37-P3749_1053192:467-nf] with pride, but have the gentle and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to think.[fn-37-P3750_1053388:468-nf] This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly. For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they are put into the treasury.[fn-37-P3751_1053611:469-nf] All too little, at the same time, is it[fn-37-P3752_1053672:470-nf] if gifts are cast into[fn-37-P3753_1053895:471-nf] the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man says, further, that it is written, that \"except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-37-P3754_1054456:472-nf] Wall, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;[fn-37-P3755_1054636:473-nf] so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently, to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable of it; but, at the, same time, to employ[fn-37-P3756_1054971:474-nf] riches for the work of righteousness and mercy, is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;[fn-37-P3757_1055410:475-nf] for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.[fn-37-P3758_1055469:476-nf] And this, the law's relation to the Sabbath, was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom's chamber, and who prepares the same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger, but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom's arrival; so that when he is come, the same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, \"Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? \"[fn-37-P3759_1056134:477-nf] And again, He did not actually reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead the cause of circumcision,[fn-37-P3760_1056364:478-nf] relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.[fn-37-P3761_1056521:479-nf] For what, indeed, can it profit a man to circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour? He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,[fn-37-P3762_1056873:480-nf] lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear splendid to men's view, we should inwardly he comparable only to ravening wolves,[fn-37-P3763_1057292:481-nf] or be likened to whited sepulchres.[fn-37-P3764_1057350:482-nf] For far above any person of that type of character is to be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless they happen also to he fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture has to say on this subject: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God? \"[fn-37-P3765_1057888:483-nf] What need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted with the compendious way of life,[fn-37-P3766_1058041:484-nf] and know that it shall he mine if only I can be pure in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit, that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and the prophets.[fn-37-P3767_1058313:485-nf] Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us yet clearer instruction on the subject, when be says, \"Or seek yea proof of that Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-37-P3768_1058522:486-nf] What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified in uncircumcision? For it is written: \"Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.\"[fn-37-P3769_1058856:487-nf] Consequently, as circumcision is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made forthwith a transgressor[fn-37-P3770_1059118:488-nf] of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised, and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life. For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in the mere ink,[fn-37-P3771_1059591:489-nf] in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.[fn-37-P3772_1059667:490-nf] Wherefore let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthen-ware in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,[fn-37-P3773_1060140:491-nf] are to be held in abhor-fence by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means[fn-37-P3774_1060481:492-nf] stand in need of that most profitless fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil. Far be it from me to do so! If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle's first epistle.[fn-37-P3775_1060860:493-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":23,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_67_the_protevangelium_of_james","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"ANF-08","text":"23.

Now as to the point that the writings going the round as mine are not mine at all, the angry feeling felt against me so confuses their reason that they cannot see what is profitable. Nevertheless, if the question were put to them by yourselves, I do think that they would not reach such a pitch of obstinate perversity as to dare to utter the lie with their own lips, and allege the document in question to be mine. And if it is not mine, why am I being judged for other men's writings? But they will urge that I am in communion with Apollinarius, and cherish in my heart perverse doctrines of this kind. Let them be asked for proof. If they are able to search into a man's heart, let them say so; and do you admit the truth of all that they say about everything. If on the other hand, they are trying to prove my being in communion on plain and open grounds, let them produce either a canonical letter written by me to him, or by him to me. Let them shew that I have held intercourse with his clergy, or have ever received any one of them into the communion of prayer. If they adduce the letter written now five and twenty years ago, written by layman to layman, and not even this as I wrote it, but altered (God knows by whom), then recognise their unfairness. No bishop is accused if, while he was a layman, he wrote something somewhat incautiously on an indifferent matter; not anything concerning the Faith, but a mere word of friendly greeting. Possibly even my opponents are known to have written to Jews and to Pagans, without incurring any blame. Hitherto no one has ever been judged for any such conduct as that on which I am being condemned by these strainers-out of gnats.[fn-53-P5342_1679859:3-nf] God, who knows men's hearts, knows that I never wrote these things, nor sanctioned them, but that I anathematize all who hold the vile opinion of the confusion of the hypostases, on which point the most impious heresy of Sabellius has been revived. And all the brethren who have been personally acquainted with my insignificant self know it equally well. Let those very men who now vehemently accuse me, search their own consciences, and they will own that from my boyhood I have been far removed from any doctrine of the kind.","title":"Letter CCXXIV.","author":"St. Basil"}]
