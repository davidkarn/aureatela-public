And they passed as traitors of their parents, and by their treachery did they not[fn-2-P270_36920:5-nf] reap profit. And even now they have added to their sins lusts and iniquitous pollutions, and thus their iniquities have, been filled up. But make known[fn-2-P271_37096:6-nf] these words to all your children, and to your wife, who is to be your sister. For she does not[fn-2-P272_37283:7-nf] restrain her tongue, with which she commits iniquity; but, on hearing these words, she will control herself, and will obtain mercy. For after you have made known to them these words which my Lord has commanded me to reveal to you,[fn-2-P273_37568:8-nf] then shall they be forgiven all the sins which in former times they committed, and forgiveness will be granted to all the saints who have sinned even to the present day, if they repent with all their heart, and drive all doubts from their minds.[fn-2-P274_37956:9-nf] For the Lord has sworn by His glory, in regard to His elect, that if any one of them sin after a certain day which has been fixed, he shall not be saved. For the repentance of the righteous has limits.[fn-2-P275_38209:10-nf] Filled up are the days of repentance to all the saints; but to the heathen, repentance will be possible even to the last day. You will tell, therefore, those who preside over the Church, to direct their ways in righteousness, that they may receive in full the promises with great glory.

The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,[fn-8-P832_333603:162-nf] not of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, \"You find him in the temple of ¦sculapius; \"and, \"I live in Isis Street; \"and, \"He has been made priest of Jupiter; \"and much else after this manner, since even on men names of this kind are bestowed.

But there is a sight of that form of mine, in which when I was, I thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but in order to take this form I emptied myself.[fn-4-P416_148519:189-nf] That one God, therefore, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, who will not appear, except for joy which cannot be taken away from the just; for which future joy he sighs, who says, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord:\"[fn-4-P417_148895:190-nf] that one God, therefore, Himself, I say, is alone good, for this reason, that no one sees Him for sorrow and wailing, but only for salvation and true joy.

If thou art amongthose who \"shall look upon Him whom they have pierced,\"[fn-4-P418_149279:191-nf] that very sight itself will be evil to them, because it will be penal. That after this meaning, then, the Lord said, \"Why askest thou me about good? there is none good but One, that is, God,\" is probable upon those proofs which I have alleged, because that sight of God, whereby we shall contemplate the substance of God unchangeable and invisible to human eyes (which is promised to the saints alone; which the Apostle Paul speaks of, as \"face to face;\"[fn-4-P419_149756:192-nf] and of which the Apostle John says, \"We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;\"[fn-4-P420_149871:193-nf] and of which it is said, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord,\" and of which the Lord Himself says, \"I will both love him, and will manifest myself to him;\"[fn-4-P421_150093:194-nf] and on account of which alone we cleanse our hearts by faith, that we may be those \"pure in heart who are blessed for they shall see God:\"[fn-4-P422_150253:195-nf] and whatever else is spoken of that sight: which whosoever turns the eye of love to seek it, may find most copiously scattered through all the Scriptures),-that sight alone, I say, is our chief good, for the attaining of which we are directed to do whatever we do aright. But that sight of the Son of man which is foretold, when all nations shall be gathered before Him, and shall say to Him, \"Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or thirsty, etc.?\" will neither be a good to the ungodly, who shall be sent into everlasting fire, nor the chief good to the righteous. For He still goes on to call these to the kingdom which has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world. For, as He will say to those, \"Depart into everlasting fire;\" so to these,\" Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.\" And as those will go into everlasting burning; so the righteous will go into life eternal. But what is life eternal, except \"that they may know Thee,\" He says, \"the One true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent?\"[fn-4-P423_151320:196-nf] but know Him now in that glory of which He says to the Father, \"Which I had with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-4-P424_151459:197-nf] For then He will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,[fn-4-P425_151547:198-nf] that the good servant may enter into the joy of his Lord,[fn-4-P426_151627:199-nf] and that He may hide those whom God keeps in the hiding of His countenance from the confusion of men, namely, of those men who shall then be confounded by hearing this sentence; of which evil hearing \"the righteous man shall not be afraid\"[fn-4-P427_151893:200-nf] if only he be kept in \"the tabernacle,\" that is, in the true faith of the Catholic Church, from \"the strife of tongues,\"[fn-4-P428_152034:201-nf] that is, from the sophistries of heretics. But if there is any other explanation of the words of the Lord, where He says, \"Why asketh thou me about good? there is none good, but One, that is, God;\" provided only that the substance of the Father be not therefore believed to be of greater goodness than that of the Son, according to which He is the Word by whom all things were made; and if there is nothing in it abhorrent from sound doctrine; let us securely use it, and not one explanation only, but as many as we are able to find. For so much the more powerfully are the heretics proved wrong, the more outlets are open for avoiding their snares.

And this is perhaps the sin against the Holy Ghost, i.e. through malice and envy to act in opposition to brotherly love after receiving the grace of the Holy Ghost,-a sin which our Lord says is not forgiven either in this world or in the world to come. And hence it may be asked whether the Jews sinned against the Holy Ghost, when they said that our Lord was casting out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils: whether we are to understand this as said against our Lord Himself, because He says of Himself in another passage, \"If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how muchmore shall they call them of His household!\"[fn-5-P558_196692:223-nf] or whether, inasmuch as they had spoken from great envy, being ungrateful for so manifest benefits, although they were not yet Christians, theyare, from the very greatness of their envy, to be supposed to have sinned against the Holy Ghost? This latter is certainly not to be gathered from our Lord's words. For although He has said in the same passage, \"And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come;\" yet it may seem that He admonished them for this purpose, that they should come to His grace, and after accepting of it should not so sin as they have now sinned. For now they have spoken a word against the Son of man, and it may be forgiven them, if they be converted, and believe on Him, and receive the Holy Ghost; but if, after receiving Him, they should choose to envy the brotherhood, and to assail the grace they have received, it cannot be forgiven them, neither in this world nor in the world to come. For if He reckoned them so condemned, that there was no hope left for them, He would not judge that they ought still to be admonished, as He did by adding the statement, \"Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt.\"[fn-5-P559_198069:224-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"257","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

But to put a more searching question still: let Novatian tell us how he distinguishes speaking against the Son of Man from blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. For I maintain that on his principles men who have denied Christ under persecution have only spoken against the Son of Man, and have not blasphemed the Holy Ghost. For when a man is asked if he is a Christian, and declares that he is not; obviously in denying Christ, that is the Son of Man, he does no despite to the Holy Ghost. But if his denial of Christ involves a denial of the Holy Ghost, this heretic can perhaps tell us how the Son of Man can be denied without sinning against the Holy Ghost. If he thinks that we are here intended by the term Holy Ghost to understand the Father, no mention at all of the Father is made by the denier in his denial. When the apostle Peter, taken aback by a maid's question, denied the Lord, did he sin against the Son of Man or against the Holy Ghost? If Novatian absurdly twists Peter's words, \"I know not the man,\"[fn-13-P1330_292681:898-nf] to mean a denial not of Christ's Messiahship but of His humanity, he will make the Saviour a liar, for He foretold[fn-13-P1331_292819:899-nf] that He Himself, that is His divine Sonship, must be denied. Now, when Peter denied the Son of God, he wept bitterly and effaced his threefold denial by a threefold confession.[fn-13-P1332_293037:900-nf] His sin, therefore, was not the sin against the Holy Ghost which can never be forgiven. It is obvious, then, that this sin involves blasphemy, calling one Beelzebub for his actions, whose virtues prove him to be God. If Novatian can bring an instance of a renegade who has called Christ Beelzebub, I will at once give up my position and admit that after such a fall the denier can win no forgiveness. To give way under torture and to deny oneself to be a Christian is one thing, to say that Christ is the devil is another.

And in [the interpretation of] this passage we must be very much on our guard against the error of those who judge from these same two trees that there are two original natures, the one of which belongs to God, but the other neither belongs to God nor springs from Him. And this error has both been already discussed in other books [of ours][fn-9-P935_362108:222-nf] very copiously, and if that is still too little, will be discussed again; but at present we have merely to show that the two trees before us do not help them. In the first place, because it is so clear that He is speaking of men, that whoever reads what goes before and what follows will wonder at their blindness. Secondly, they fix their attention on what is said, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\" and therefore think that neither can it happen that an evil soul should be changed into something better, nor a good one into something worse; as if it were said, A good tree cannot become evil, nor an evil tree good. But it is said, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\" For the tree is certainly the soul itself, i.e. the man himself, but the fruits are the works of the man; an evil man, therefore, cannot perform good works, nor a good man evil works. If an evil man, therefore, wishes to perform good works, let him first become good. So the Lord Himself says in another passage more plainly: \"Either make the tree good, or make the tree bad.\" But if He were figuratively representing the two natures of such parties by these two trees, He would not say, \"Make:\" for who of the sons of men can make a nature? Then also in that passage, when He had made mention of these two trees, He added, \"Ye hypocrites, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?\"[fn-9-P936_363877:223-nf] As long, therefore, as any one is evil, he cannot bring forth good fruits; for if he were to bring forth good fruits, he would no longer be evil. So it might most truly have been said, snow cannot be warm; for when it begins to be warm, we no longer call it snow, but water. It may therefore come about, that what was snow is no longer so; but it cannot happen that snow should be warm. So it may come about, that he who was evil is no longer evil; it cannot, however, happen that an evil man should do good. And although he is sometimes useful, this is not the man's own doing; but it is done through him, in virtue of the arrangements of divine providence: as, for instance, it is said of the Pharisees, \"What they bid you, do; but what they do, do not consent to do.\" This very circumstance, that they spoke things that were good, and that the things which they spoke were usefully listened to and done, was not a matter belonging to them: for, says He, \"they sit in Moses' seat.\"[fn-9-P937_364887:224-nf] It was, therefore, when engaged through divine providence in preaching the law of God, that they were able to be useful to their hearers, although they were not so to themselves. Respecting such it is said in another place by the prophet, \"They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns;\"[fn-9-P938_365199:225-nf] because they teach what is good, and do what is evil. Those, therefore, who listened to them, and did what was said by them, did not gather grapes of thorns, but through the thorns gathered grapes of the vine: just as, were any one to thrust his hand through a hedge, or were at least to gather a grape from a vine which was entangled in a hedge, that would not be the fruit of the thorns, but of the vine.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_07_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"8.

Hilary is fearful of weakening man's sense of moral responsibility by dwelling too much upon God's work which, however, he does not fail to recognise. Of the two great dangers, that of faith and that of life, the former seemed to him the more serious. God's requirements in that respect were easy of fulfilment; He had stated the truth and He expected it to be unhesitatingly accepted. But if belief, being an exertion of the will, was easy, misbelief must be peculiarly and fatally wicked. The confession of St. Peter, the foundation upon which the Church is built, is that Christ is God[fn-6-P623_413294:432-nf] ; the sin against the Holy Ghost is denial of this truth[fn-6-P624_413372:433-nf] . These are the highest glory and the deepest shame of man. It does not seem that Hilary regarded any man, however depraved, as beyond hope so long as he did not dispute this truth; he has no code of mortal sins. But heresy concerning Christ, whatever the conduct and character of the heretic, excludes all possibility of salvation, for it necessarily cuts him off from the one Faith and the one Church which are the condition and the sphere of growth towards perfection; and the severance is just, because misbelief is a wilful sin. Since, then, compliance or non-compliance with one of God's demands, that for faith in His revelation, depends upon the will, it was natural that Hilary should lay stress upon the importance of the will in regard to God's other demand, that for a Christian life. This was, in a sense, a lighter requirement, for various degrees of obedience were possible. Conduct could neither give nor deny faith, but only affect its growth, while without the frank recognition of the facts of religion no conduct could be acceptable to God. Life presents to the will a constantly changing series of choices between good and evil, while the Faith must be accepted or rejected at once and as a whole. It is clear from Hilary's insistence upon this that the difficulties, apart from heresy, with which he had to contend resembled those of Mission work in modern India. There were many who would accept Christianity as a revelation, yet had not the moral strength to live in conformity with their belief. Of such persons Hilary will not despair They have the first essential of salvation, a clear and definite acceptance of doctrinal truth; they have also the offer of sufficient grace, and the free will and power to use it. And time and opportunity are granted, for the vicissitudes of life form a progressive education; they are, if taken aright, the school, the training-ground for iimmortality[fn-6-P625_415328:434-nf] . This is because all Christians are in Christ, by virtue of His Incarnation. They are, as St. Paul says, complete in Him, furnished with the faith and hope they need. But this is only a preparatory completeness; hereafter they shall be complete in themselves, when the perfect harmony is attained and they are conformed to his glory[fn-6-P626_415682:435-nf] . Thus to the end the dignity and responsibility of mankind is maintained. But it is obvious that Hilary has failed to correlate the work of Christ with the work of the Christian. The necessity of His guidance and aid, and the manner in which these are bestowed, is sufficiently stated, and the duty of the Christian man is copiously and eloquently enforced. But the importance of Christ's work within Himself, in harmonising the twonatures, has withdrawn most of Hilary's attention from His work within the believing soul; and the impression which Hilary's writings leave upon the mind concerning the Saviour and redeemed mankind is that of allied forces seeking the same end but acting independently, each in a sphere of its own.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":12,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_05_prolegomena","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Arian Literature.

Augustin said: I recognize and embrace the testimonies of the divine Scriptures, and I will show in a few words, as God may deign to grant, how they are consistent with my faith. I say that there was free exercise of will in that man who was first formed. He was so made that absolutely nothing could resist his will, if he had willed to keep the precepts of God. But after he voluntarily sinned, we who have descended from his stock were plunged into necessity. But each one of us can by a little consideration find that what I say is true. For today in our actions before we are implicated by any habit, we have free choice of doing anything or not doing it. But when by that liberty we have done something and the pernicious sweetness and pleasure of that deed has taken hold upon the mind, by its own habit the mind is so implicated that afterwards it cannot conquer what by sinning it has fashioned for itself. We see many who do not wish to swear, but because the tongue has already become habituated, they are not able to prevent those things from going forth from the mouth which we cannot but ascribe to the root of evil. For that I may discuss with you those words, which as they do not withdraw from your mouth so may they be understood by your heart: you swear by the Paraclete. If therefore you wish to find out experimentally whether what I say is true, determine not to swear. You will see, that that habit is borne along as it has become accustomed to be. And this is what wars against the soul, habit formed in the flesh. This is indeed the mind of the flesh, which, as long as it cannot thus be subject to the law of God, so long is it the mind of the flesh; but when the soul has been illuminated it ceases to be the mind of the flesh. For thus it is said the mind of the flesh cannot be subject to the law of God, just as if it were said, that snow cannot be warm. Far so long as it is snow, it can in no way be warm. But as the snow is melted by heat, so that it may become warm, so the mind of the flesh, that is, habit formed with the flesh, when our mind has become illuminated, that is, when God has subjected for Himself the whole man to the choice of the divine law, instead of the evil habit of the soul, makes a good habit. Accordingly it is most truly said by the Lord of the two trees, the one good and the other evil, which you have called to mind, that they have their own fruits; that is, neither can the good tree yield evil fruit, nor the evil tree good fruit, but so long as it is evil. Let us take two men, a good and a bad. As long as he is good he cannot yield evil fruit; as long as he is bad he cannot yield good fruit. But that you may know that those two trees are so placed by the Lord, that free choice may be there signified, that these two trees are not natures but our wills, He Himself says in the gospel: \"Either make the tree good, or make the tree evil.\"[fn-9-P904_473740:9-nf] Who is it that can make nature? If therefore we are commanded to make a tree either good or evil, it is ours to choose what we will. Therefore concerning that sin of man and concerning that habit of soul formed with the flesh the apostle says: \"Let no one seduce you;\"[fn-9-P905_474028:10-nf] \"Every creature that has been made by God is good.\"[fn-9-P906_474096:11-nf] The same apostle whom you also have cited says: \"As through the disobedience of the one the many were constituted sinners; so also through the obedience of the one the many are constituted righteous.\"[fn-9-P907_474316:12-nf] \"Since through man is death, through man also is resurrection of the dead.\" As long therefore as we bear the image of the earthly man,[fn-9-P908_474468:13-nf] that is, as long as we live according to the flesh, which is also called the old man, we have the necessity of our habit, so that we may not do what we will. But when the grace of God has breathed the divine love into us and has made us subject to His will, to us it is said: \"Ye are called for freedom,\"[fn-9-P909_474798:14-nf] and \"the grace of God has made me free from the law of sin and of death.\"[fn-9-P910_474889:15-nf] But the law of sin is that whoever has sinned shall die. From this law we are freed when we have begun to be righteous. The law of death is that by which it was said to man: \"Earth thou art and into earth thou shalt go.\"[fn-9-P911_475129:16-nf] For from this very fact we are all so born, because we are earth, and from the fact that we are all so born because we are earth, we shall all go into earth on account of the desert of the sins of the first man. But on account of the grace of God, which frees us from the law of sin and of death, having been converted to righteousness we are freed; so that afterwards this same flesh tortures us with its punishment so long as we remain in sins, is subjected to us in resurrection, and shakes us by no adversity from keeping the law of God and His precepts. Whence, since I have replied to your questions, deign to reply as I desire, how it can happen, that if nature is contrary to God, sin should be imputed to us, who were sent into that nature not voluntarily, but by God Himself, whom nothing could injure?","title":"Disputation of the Second Day.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":57,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"In such circumstances, no man of those who have come to Christ by baptism has ever been regarded, according to sound faith and the true doctrine, as excepted from the grace of forgiveness of sins; nor has eternal life been ever thought possible to any man apart from His kingdom. For this [eternal life] is ready to be revealed at the last time,[fn-6-P633_424957:194-nf] that is, at the resurrection of the dead who are reserved not for that eternal death which is called \"the second death,\" but for the eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promises to His saints and faithful servants. Now none who shall partake of this life shall be made alive except in Christ, even as all die in Adam.[fn-6-P634_425299:195-nf] For as none whatever, of all those who belong to the generation according to the will of the flesh, die except in Adam, in whom all sinned; so, out of these, none at all who are regenerated by the will of the Spirit are endowed with life except in Christ, in whom all are justified. Because as through one all to condemnation, so through One all to justification.[fn-6-P635_425685:196-nf] Nor is there any middle place for any man, and so a man can only be with the devil who is not with Christ. Accordingly, also the Lord Himself (wishing to remove from the hearts of wrong-believers[fn-6-P636_425900:197-nf] that vague and indefinite middle condition, which some would provide for unbaptized infants,-as if, by reason of their innocence, they were embraced in eternal life, but were not, because of their unbaptized state, with Christ in His kingdom) uttered that definitive sentence of His, which shuts their mouths: \"He that is not with me is against me.\"[fn-6-P637_426274:198-nf] Take then the case of any infant you please: If he is already in Christ, why is he baptized? If, however, as the Truth has it, he is baptized just that he may be with Christ, it certainly follows that he who is not baptized is not with Christ; and because he is not \"with\" Christ, he is \"against\" Christ; for He has pronounced His own sentence, whichis so explicit that we ought not, and indeed cannot, impair it or change it. And how can he be \"against\" Christ, if not owing to sin? for it cannot possibly be from his soul or his body, both of these being the creation of God. Now if it be owing to sin, what sin can be found at such an age, except the ancient and original sin? Of course that sinful flesh in which all are born to condemnation is one thing, and that Flesh which was made \"after the likeness of sinful flesh,\" whereby also all are freed from condemnation, is another thing. It is, however, by no means meant to be implied that all who are born in sinful flesh are themselves actually cleansed by that Flesh which is \"like\" sinful flesh; \"for all men have not faith;\"[fn-6-P638_427381:199-nf] but that all who are born from the carnal union are born entirely of sinful flesh, whilst all who are born from the spiritual union are cleansed only by the Flesh which is in the likeness of sinful flesh. In other words, the former class are in Adam unto condemnation, the latter are in Christ unto justification. This is as if we should say, for example, that in such a city there is a certain midwife who delivers all; and in the same place there is an expert teacher who instructs all. By all, in the one case, only those who are born can possibly be understood; by all, in the other, only those who are taught: and it does not follow that all who are born also receive the instruction. But it is obvious to every one, that in the one case it is correctly said, \"she delivers all,\" since without her aid no one is born; and in the other, it is rightly said, \"he teaches all,\" since without his tutoring, no one learns.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":45,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_15_commandment_fifth","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Hear now,\" said he, \"how wicked is the action of anger, and in what way it overthrows the servants of God by its action, and turns them from righteousness.

And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":12,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"190","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"75.

What will these reckless asserters of whatever suits their purpose answer, when they are reminded of the great prophet Elijah,[fn-10-P1069_475679:34-nf] who by calling upon God had recalled the dead to life, hiding himself from dread of Ahab, and fleeing on account of Jezebel's menaces?

Again in the consummation of the ages, when the Word of the Father, who had before spoken by Moses, came himself to the earth, he gave this express injunction, `When they persecute you in one city, flee unto another:'[fn-10-P1074_477219:39-nf] and shortly after, `When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (let whosoever reads, understand), then let those in Judea flee unto the mountains: let him that is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house; nor him that is in the fields return to take his clothes.'[fn-10-P1075_477598:40-nf] The saints therefore knowing these precepts, had such a sort of training for their action: for what the Lord then commanded, he had before his coming in the flesh already spoken of by his servants.

Again when the Saviour said, `Before Abraham was, I am;'[fn-10-P1081_479225:46-nf] and the Jews took up stones to cast at him; Jesus concealed himself, and going through the midst of them out of the Temple, went away thence, and so escaped.

Finally, when John had suffered martyrdom, and his disciples had buried his body, Jesus having heard what was done, departed thence by ship into a desert place apart.[fn-10-P1083_479849:48-nf] Now the Lord did these things and so taught.

Wherefore also the prophet David says, \"Thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\"[fn-8-P862_140100:174-nf] And this the great Paul, the herald of the truth, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, states to have been spoken of the Son.[fn-8-P863_140270:175-nf] And in another place God says through the Prophet, \"I am the Lord: I change not.\"[fn-8-P864_140515:176-nf] If then the Divine is immutable and invariable, it is incapable of change or alteration. And if the immutable cannot be changed, then God the Word was not made flesh by mutation, but took flesh and tabernacled in us, according to the word of the evangelist. This the divine Paul expresses clearly in his Epistle to the Philippians in the words, \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-8-P865_141138:177-nf] Now it is plain from these words that the form of God was not changed into the form of a servant, but, remaining what it was, took the form of the servant. So God the Word was not made flesh, but assumed living and reasonable flesh. He Himself is not naturally conceived of the Virgin, fashioned, formed, and deriving beginning of existence from her; He who is before the ages, God, and with God, being with the Father and with the Father both known and worshipped; but He fashioned for Himself a temple in the Virgin's womb, and was with that which was formed and begotten. Wherefore also we style that holy Virgin qeotokoj, not because she gave birth in natural manner to God, but to man united to the God that had fashioned Him. Moreover if He that was fashioned in the Virgin's womb was not man but God the Word Who is before the ages, then God the Word is a creature of the Holy Ghost. For that which was conceived in her, says Gabriel, is of the Holy Ghost.[fn-8-P866_142121:178-nf] But if the only begotten Word of God is uncreate and of one substance and co-eternal with the Father it is no longer a formation or creation of the Spirit. And if the Holy Ghost did not fashion God the Word in the Virgin's womb, it follows that we understand the form of the servant to have been fashioned, formed, conceived, and generated. But since the form was not stripped of the form of God, but was a Temple containing God the Word dwelling in it, according to the words of Paul \"For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell\" \"bodily,\"[fn-8-P867_142703:179-nf] we call the Virgin not mother of man (anqrwpotokoj) but mother of God (qeotokoj), applying the former title to the fashioning and conception, but the latter to the union. For this cause the child who was born is called Emmanuel, neither God separated from human nature nor man stripped of Godhead. For Emmanuel is interpreted to mean \"God with us\", according to the words of the Gospels; and the expression \"God with us\" at once manifests Him Who for our sakes was assumed out of us, and proclaims God the Word Who assumed. Therefore the child is called Emmanuel on account of God Who assumed, and the Virgin qeotokoj on account of the union of the form of God with the conceived form of a servant. For God the Word was not changed into flesh, but the form of God took the form of a servant.","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":12,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_08_counter_statements_of_theodoret_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Against IX.-Here he has plainly had the hardihood to anathematize not only those who at the present time hold pious opinions, but also those who were in former days heralds of truth; aye even the writers of the divine gospels, the band of the holy Apostles, and, in addition to these, Gabriel the archangel. For he indeed it was who first, even before the conception, announced the birth of the Christ according to the flesh; saying in reply to Mary when she asked, \"How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\" \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-9-P902_160022:206-nf] And to Joseph he said, \"Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P903_160177:207-nf] And the Evangelist says, \"When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph...she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P904_160315:208-nf] And the Lord Himself when He had come into the synagogue of the Jews and had taken the prophet Isaiah, after reading the passage in which he says, \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me\" and so on, added, \"This day is this scripture ful-filled in your ears.\"[fn-9-P905_160619:209-nf] And the blessed Peter in his sermon to the Jews said, \"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P906_160760:210-nf] And Isaiah many ages before had predicted, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;\"[fn-9-P907_161095:211-nf] and again, \"Behold my servant whom I uphold, my beloved in whom my soul delighteth. I will put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.\"[fn-9-P908_161293:212-nf] This testimony the Evangelist too has inserted in his own writings. And the Lord Himself in the Gospels says to the Jews, \"If I with the spirit of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come ripen you.\"[fn-9-P909_161532:213-nf] And John says, \"He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P910_161754:214-nf] So this exact examiner of the divine decrees has not only anathematized prophets, apostles, and even the archangel Gabriel, but has suffered his blasphemy to reach even the Saviour of the world Himself. For we have shewn that the Lord Himself after reading the passage \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me,\" said to the Jews, \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\" And to those who said that He was casting out devils by Beelzebub He replied that He was casting them out by the Spirit of God. But we maintain that it was not God the Word, of one substance and co-eternal with the Father, that was formed by the Holy Ghost and anointed, but the human nature which was assumed by Him at the end of days. We shall confess that the Spirit of the Son was His own if he spoke of it as of the same nature and proceeding from the Father, and shall accept the expression as consistent with true piety. But if he speaks of the Spirit as being of the Son, or as having its origin through the Son we shall reject this statement as blasphemous and impious. For we believe the Lord when He says, \"The spirit which proceedeth from the Father;\"[fn-9-P911_162942:215-nf] and likewise the very divine Paul saying, \"We have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God.\"[fn-9-P912_163094:216-nf] ","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":12,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_08_the_perpetual_virginity_of_blessed_mary","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"13.

It was a manifest cavil; they cavilled at Him merely commanding, they cavilled at Him speaking; as if they did not themselves speak all the sabbath day.

He is more obscure in his pity than in his indignation. He is more open in his austerity than in his lenity. And yet, (generally), anger is more readily indirect than indulgence. Things of a sadder are more wont to hesitate than things of a more joyous cast. Of course the question in hand concerned some moderate indulgence; which (moderation in the indulgence) was now, if ever, to be divined, when it is usual for all the greatest indulgences not to be granted without public proclamation, so far (are they from being granted) without particularization. Why, do you yourself, when introducing into the church, for the purpose of melting the brotherhood by his prayers, the repentant adulterer, lead into the midst and prostrate him, all in haircloth and ashes, a compound of disgrace and horror, before the widows, before the elders, suing for the tears of all, licking the footprints of all, clasping the knees of all?

And would the apostle so carelessly have granted indulgence to the atrocious licentiousness of fornication burdened with incest, as not at least to have exacted from the criminal even this legally established garb of repentance which you ought to have learned from him? as to have uttered no commination on the past? no allocution touching the future? Nay, more; he goes further, and beseeches that they \"would confirm toward him affection,\" as if he were making satisfaction to him, not as if he were granting an indulgence! And yet I hear (him speak of) \"affection,\" not \"communion; \"as (he writes) withal to the Thessalonians \"But if any obey not our word through the epistle, him mark; and associate not with him, that he may feel awed; not regarding (him) as an enemy, but rebuking as a brother.\"[fn-14-P1458_419119:129-nf] Accordingly, he could have said that to a fornicator, too, \"affection\" only was conceded, not \"communion \"as well; to an incestuous man, however, not even \"affection; \"whom he would, to be sure, have bidden to be banished from their midst[fn-14-P1459_419387:130-nf] -much more, of course, from their mind. \"But he was apprehensive lest they should be `overreached by Satan' with regard to the loss of that person whom himself had cast forth to Satan; or else lest, `by abundance of mourning, he should be devoured' whom he had sentenced to `destruction of the flesh.'\" Here they go so far as to interpret \"destruction of the flesh\" the office of repentance; in that by fasts, and squalor, and every species of neglect and studious ill-treatment devoted to the extermination of the flesh, it seems to make satisfaction to God; so that they argue that that fornicator-that incestuous person rather-having been delivered by the apostle to Satan, not with a view to \"perdition,\" but with a view to \"emendation,\" on the hypothesis that subsequently he would, on account of the \"destruction\" (that is, the general affliction) \"of the flesh,\" attain pardon, therefore did actually attain it. Plainly, the selfsame apostle delivered to Satan Hymenaeus and Alexander, \"that they might be emended into not blaspheming,\"[fn-14-P1460_420457:131-nf] as he writes to his Timotheus. \"But withal himself says that `a stake[fn-14-P1461_420548:132-nf] was given him, an angel of Satan, 'by which he was to be buffeted, lest he should exalt himself\" If they touch upon this (instance) withal, in order to lead us to understand that such as were \"delivered to Sam\" by him (were so delivered) with a view to emendation, not to perdition; what similarity is there between blasphemy and incest, and a soul entirely free from these,-nay, rather elated from no other source than the highest sanctity and all innocence; which (elation of soul) was being restrained in the apostle by \"buffets,\" if you will, by means (as they say) of pain in the ear or head? Incest, however, and blasphemy, deserved to have delivered the entire persons of men to Satan himself for a possession, not to \"an angel\" of his. And (there is yet another point): for about this it makes a difference, nay, rather withal in regard to this it is of the utmost consequence, that we find those men delivered by the apostle to Satan, but to the apostle himself an angel of Satan given. Lastly, when Paul is praying the Lord for its removal, what does he hear? \"Hold my grace sufficient; for virtue is perfected in infirmity.\"[fn-14-P1462_421709:133-nf] This they who are surrendered to Satan cannot hear. Moreover, if the crime of Hymenaeus and Alexander-blasphemy, to wit-is irremissible in this and in the future. age,[fn-14-P1463_421926:134-nf] of course the apostle would not, in opposition to the determinate decision of the Lord, have given to Satan, under a hope of pardon, men already sunken from the faith into blasphemy; whence, too, he pronounced them \"shipwrecked with regard to faith,\"[fn-14-P1464_422211:135-nf] having no longer the solace of the ship, the Church. For to those who, after believing, have struck upon (the rock of) blasphemy, pardon is denied; on the other hand, heathens and heretics are daily emerging out of blasphemy. But even if he did say, \"I delivered them to Satan, that they might receive the discipline of not blaspheming,\" he said it of the rest, who, by their deliverance to Satan-that is, their projection outside the Church-had to be trained in the knowledge that there must be no blaspheming. So, therefore, the incestuous fornicator, too, he delivered, not with a view to emendation, but with a view to perdition, to Satan, to whom he had already, by sinning above an heathen, gone over; that they might learn there must be no fornicating. Finally, he says, \"for the destruction of the flesh,\" not its \"torture\"-condemning the actual substance through which he had fallen out (of the faith), which substance had already perished immediately on the loss of baptism-\" in order that the spirit,\" he says, \"may be saved in the day of the Lord.\" And (here, again, is a difficulty): for let this point be inquired into, whether the man's own spirit will be saved. In that case, a spirit polluted with so great a wickedness will be saved; the object of the perdition of the flesh being, that the spirit may be saved in penalty. In that case, the interpretation which is contrary to ours will recognise a penalty without the flesh, if we lose the resurrection of the flesh. It remains, therefore, that his meaning was, that that spirit which is accounted to exist in the Church must be presented \"saved,\" that is, untainted by the contagion of impurities in the day of the Lord, by the ejection of the incestuous fornicator; if, that is, he subjoins: \"Know ye not, that a little leaven spoileth the savour of the whole lump? \"[fn-14-P1465_424072:136-nf] And yet incestuous fornication was not a little, but a large, leaven.","title":"VII.

So then both the Shepherd of shepherds, and the shepherds of the Shepherd, and the sheep with their shepherds under The Shepherd.

We have Their witness also that there shall be no God after Him; but They do not deny that God has been born from Him in the past.

For those in whom the Holy One dwells, He makes holy, even as the Good One makes men good. And the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are holy and good, as has been shown. \"Acting as a guide to those who approach the mystery.\" This may well be said of Apollos who watered what Paul planted. For the Apostle plants by his guidance[fn-12-P1272_692308:250-nf] , and Apollos, when he baptizes, waters by Sacramental regeneration, bringing to the mystery those who were instructed by Paul. Thus he places on a level with Apollos that Spirit Who perfects men through baptism. \"Distributing every gift.\" With this we too agree; for everything that is good is a portion of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. \"Co-operating with the faithful for the understanding and contemplation of things appointed.\" As he does not add by whom they are appointed, he leaves his meaning doubtful, whether it is correct or the reverse. But we will by a slight addition advance his statement so as to make it consistent with godliness. For since, whether it be the word of wisdom, or the word of knowledge, or faith, or help, or government, or aught else that is enumerated in the lists of saving gifts, \"all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will[fn-12-P1273_693352:251-nf] ,\" we therefore do not reject the statement of Eunomius when he says that the Spirit \"co-operates with the faithful for understanding and contemplation of things appointed\" by Him, because by Him all good teachings are appointed for us. \"Sounding an accompaniment to those who pray.\" It would be foolish seriously to examine the meaning of this expression, of which the ludicrous and meaningless character is at once manifest to all. For who is so demented and beside himself as to wait for us to tell him that the Holy Spirit is not a bell nor an empty cask sounding an accompaniment and made to ring by the voice of him who prays as it were by a blow? \"Leading us to that which is expedient for us.\" This the Father and the Son likewise do: for \"He leadeth Joseph like a sheep[fn-12-P1274_694154:252-nf] ,\" and, \"led His people like sheep[fn-12-P1275_694209:253-nf] ,\" and, \"the good Spirit leadeth us in a land of righteousness[fn-12-P1276_694295:254-nf] .\" \"Strengthening us to godliness.\" To strengthen man to godliness David says is the work of God; \"For Thou art my strength and my refuge[fn-12-P1277_694460:255-nf] ,\" says the Psalmist, and \"the Lord is the strength of His people[fn-12-P1278_694550:256-nf] ,\" and, \"He shall give strength and power unto His people[fn-12-P1279_694630:257-nf] .\" If then the expressions of Eunomius are meant in accordance with the mind of the Psalmist, they are a testimony to the Divinity of the Holy Ghost: but if they are opposed to the word of prophecy, then by this very fact a charge of blasphemy lies against Eunomius, because he sets up his own opinions in opposition to the holy prophets. Next he says, \"Lightening souls with the light of knowledge.\" This grace also the doctrine of godliness ascribes alike to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. For He is called a light by David[fn-12-P1280_695195:258-nf] , and from thence the light of knowledge shines in them who are enlightened. In like manner also the cleansing of our thoughts of which the statement speaks is proper to the power of the Lord. For it was \"the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of His person,\" Who \"purged our sins[fn-12-P1281_695518:259-nf] .\" Again, to banish devils, which Eunomius says is a property of the Spirit, this also the only-begotten God, Who said to the devil, \"I charge thee[fn-12-P1282_695684:260-nf] ,\" ascribes to the power of the Spirit, when He says, \"If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils[fn-12-P1283_695808:261-nf] ,\" so that the expulsion of devils is not destructive of the glory of the Spirit, but rather a demonstration of His divine and transcendent power. \"Healing the sick,\" he says, \"curing the infirm, comforting the afflicted, raising up those who stumble, recovering the distressed.\" These are the words of those who think reverently of the Holy Ghost, for no one would ascribe the operation of any one of these effects to any one except to God. If then heresy affirms that those things which it belongs to none save God alone to effect, are wrought by the power of the Spirit, we have in support of the truths for which we are contending the witness even of our adversaries. How does the Psalmist seek his healing from God, saying, \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my hones are vexed[fn-12-P1284_696647:262-nf] !\" It is to God that Isaiah says, \"The dew that is from Thee is healing unto them[fn-12-P1285_696747:263-nf] .\" Again, prophetic language attests that the conversion of those in error is the work of God. For \"they went astray in the wilderness in a thirsty land,\" says the Psalmist, and he adds, \"So He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they dwelt[fn-12-P1286_697050:264-nf] :\" and, \"when the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion[fn-12-P1287_697131:265-nf] .\" In like manner also the comfort of the afflicted is ascribed to God, Paul thus speaking, \"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1288_697344:266-nf] .\" Again, the Psalmist says, speaking in the person of God \"Thou calledst upon Me in trouble and I delivered thee[fn-12-P1289_697491:267-nf] .\" And the setting upright of those who stumble is innumerable times ascribed by Scripture to the power of the Lord: \"Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord was my help[fn-12-P1290_697703:268-nf] ,\" and \"Though he fall, he shall not be cast away, for the Lord upholdeth him with His hand[fn-12-P1291_697818:269-nf] ,\" and \"The Lord helpeth them that are fallen[fn-12-P1292_697887:270-nf] .\" And to the loving-kindness of God confessedly belongs the recovery of the distressed, if Eunomius means the same thing of which we learn in prophecy, as the Scripture says, \"Thou laidest trouble upon our loins; Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, and Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place[fn-12-P1293_698246:271-nf] .\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":12,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"They likewise,\" says he, \"quote what the Saviour says: `Why callest thou me good?

Here are his remarks: \"We must answer this text with another, in which the same Lord says, `A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.'[fn-26-P2637_1044141:144-nf] And again: `He maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the evil.'[fn-26-P2638_1044231:145-nf] Then in another passage it is written, `For the good things are created from the beginning ;'[fn-26-P2639_1044345:146-nf] and yet again, `They that are good shall dwell in the land.'\"[fn-26-P2640_1044433:147-nf] Now to all this we must say in answer, that the passages in question must be understood in the same sense as the former one, \"There is none good, save one, that is, God.\" Either because all created things, although God made them very good, are yet, when compared with their Creator, not good, being in fact incapable of any comparison with Him. For in a transcendent, and yet very proper sense, He said of Himself, \"I Am that I Am.\"[fn-26-P2641_1044888:148-nf] The statement therefore before us, \"None is good save one, that is, God,\" is used in some such way as that which is said of John, \"He was not that light;\"[fn-26-P2642_1045063:149-nf] although the Lord calls him \"a lamp,\"[fn-26-P2643_1045119:150-nf] just as He says to His disciples: \"Ye are the light of the world: . . . neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel.\"[fn-26-P2644_1045400:151-nf] Still, in comparison with that light which is \"the true light which light every man that cometh into the world,\"[fn-26-P2645_1045537:152-nf] he was not light. Or else, because the very sons of God even, when compared with themselves as they shall hereafter become in their eternal perfection, are good in such a way that they still remain also evil. Although I should not have dared to say this of them (for who would be so bold as to call them evil who have God for their Father?) unless the Lord had Himself said: \"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-26-P2646_1046092:153-nf] Of course, by applying to them the words, \"your Father,\" He proved that they were already sons of God; and yet at the same time He did not hesitate to say that they were \"evil.\" Your author, however, does not explain to us how they are good, whilst yet \"there is none good save one, that is, God.\" Accordingly the man who asked \"what good thing he was to do,\"[fn-26-P2647_1046474:154-nf] was admonished to seek Him[fn-26-P2648_1046523:155-nf] by whose grace he might be good; to whom also to be good is nothing else than to be Himself, because He is unchangeably good, and cannot be evil at all.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":40,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":57,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"ANF-03","text":"By ourselves the lower regions (of Hades) are not supposed to be a bare cavity, nor some subterranean sewer of the world, but a vast deep space in the interior of the earth, and a concealed recess in its very bowels; inasmuch as we read that Christ in His death spent three days in the heart of the earth,[fn-30-P3043_1098549:310-nf] that is, in the secret inner recess which is hidden in the earth, and enclosed by the earth, and superimposed on the abysmal depths which lie still lower down.

But if any one should deny the dignity, majesty, and eternal power of the Holy Spirit, and should think that devils are cast out not in the Spirit of God, but in Beelzebub, there can be no attaining of pardon there where is the fulness of sacrilege; for he who has denied the Spirit has denied also the Father and the Son, since the same is the Spirit of God Who is the Spirit of Christ.","title":"Book I.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":12,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_20_book_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"2. Augustin replied: As regards what Faustus calls his principal reason for not receiving the genealogy of Jesus Christ, a complete refutation is found in the passages formerly quoted, where Christ declares Himself to be the Son of man, and in what we have said of the identity of the Son of man with the Son of God: that in His Godhead He has no earthly descent, while after the flesh He is of the seed of David, as the apostle teaches. We are to believe, therefore, that He came forth from the Father, that He descended from heaven, and also that the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst men. If the words, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\"[fn-12-P1296_689691:1-nf] are quoted to show that Christ had no earthly mother or descent, it follows that we must believe that His disciples, whom He here teaches by His own example to set no value on earthly relationship, as compared with the kingdom of heaven, had no fathers, because Christ says to them, \"Call no man father upon earth; for one is your Father, even God.\"[fn-12-P1297_690059:2-nf] What He taught them to do with reference to their fathers, He Himself first did in reference to His own mother and brethren; as in many other things He condescended to set us an example, and to go before that we might follow in His footsteps. Faustus' principal objection to the genealogy fails completely; and after the defeat of this invincible force, the rest is easily routed. He says that the apostles who declared Christ to be the Son of man as well as the Son of God are not to be believed, because they were not present at the birth of Christ, whom they joined when He had reached manhood, nor heard of it from Christ Himself. Why then do they believe John when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made,\"[fn-12-P1298_690947:3-nf] and such passages, which they agree to, without understanding them? Where did John see this, or did he ever hear it from the Lord Himself? In whatever way John learned this, those who narrate the nativity may have learned also. Again, how do they know that the Lord said, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\" If on the authority of the evangelist, why do they not also believe that the mother and the brethren of Christ were seeking for Him? They believe that Christ said these words, which they misunderstand, while they deny a fact resting on the same authority. Once more, if Matthew could not know that Christ was born, because he knew Him only in His manhood, how could Manichaeus, who lived so long after, know that He was not born? They will say that Manichaeus knew this from the Holy Spirit which was in him. Certainly the Holy Spirit would make him speak the truth. But why not rather believe what Christ's own disciples tell us, who were personally acquainted with Him, and who not only had the gift of inspiration to supply defects in their knowledge, but in a purely natural way obtained information of the birth of Christ, and of His descent, when the event was fresh in memory? And yet he dares to call the apostles deaf and blind. Why were you not deaf and blind, to prevent you from learning such profane nonsense, and dumb too, to prevent you from uttering it?

[\"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.\"] (Recapitulation, v. 23.) See the unostentatious conduct of the Apostles, and their largeness of mind. They did not go about boasting, and say, \"How we served (apexrhsameqa) the priests!\" nor were they ambitious of honor: but, we read, \"they came unto their own company. Observe how they do not cast themselves upon temptations, but when the temptations present themselves, with courage endure them. Had it been some other of the disciples, perhaps, emboldened by the countenance of the multitude, he might have insulted, might have vented ever so many harsh expressions. But not so these true philosophers; they do all with mildness and with gentleness. \"And when they heard that, we read, with one accord they lifted up their voice to God. (v. 24.) That shout proceeded from delight and great emotion. Such indeed are the prayers which do their work, prayers replete with true philosophy, prayers offered up for such objects, by such persons, on such occasions, in such a manner; whereas all others are abominable and profane. \"Lord, Thou the God that madest heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is.\" Observe how they say nothing idle, no old wives' talk and fables, but speak of His power. Just as Christ Himself said to the Jews, \"If I by the Spirit of God do cast out devils: behold the Father also speaks by the Spirit. For what saith it? \"Lord, the God Who,[fn-5-P599_438332:6-nf] by the Holy Ghost, through the mouth of our father Thy servant David didst say, Why did the nations rage?\" (v. 25.) Scripture is wont thus to speak of one as of many. \"For of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, Whom Thou didst anoint,[fn-6-P600_439445:7-nf] both Herod and Pontius Pilate, etc. (v. 27.) Observe how, even in prayer, they circumstantially describe the Passion, and refer all to God.-That is, Not they had power to do this: but Thou didst it all, Thou[fn-6-P601_439979:8-nf] that didst permit, that dost call to account, and yet didst bring to accomplishment, Thou the All-skilful and Wise, that didst serve Thee of Thine enemies for Thine own pleasure. (v. 28.) \"For to do whatever Thy hand,\" etc. Here they discourse of His exceeding Skill and Wisdom and Power. So then, as enemies they came together, and with murderous purpose, and as opposing themselves, but they did what things Thou wouldest: 'For to do,\" as it is said, \"whatsoever Thy hand and Thy purpose determined before to be done.\" What means, \"Thy hand?\" Here he seems to me to denote[fn-6-P602_440802:9-nf] one and the same thing by power and purpose, meaning that for Thee it is enough but to will: for it is not by power that one determines. \"Whatsoever Thy hand,\" etc. i.e. Whatsoever Thou didst ordain: either this is the meaning, or, that by His hand He did effect. \"And now, Lord, regard their threatenings.\" (v. 29.) As at that time, it is said, they \"imagined vain things,\" so \"now,\" grant that their imaginations may be in vain: i.e. let not their threatenings come into accomplishment. And this they said not because they would themselves deprecate any hardship, but for the preaching's sake. For they do not say, \"and deliver us out of dangers;\" but what? \"And grant unto Thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak Thy word.\" Thou Who didst bring to pass the former designs, bring these also to accomplishment. Observe,[fn-6-P603_442309:10-nf] how they affirm God to be the Author of their confidence; and how they ask all for God's sake, nothing for their own glory or ambition. They promise for their own part, that they will not be dismayed; but they pray that signs may be wrought \"by stretching forth Thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done:\" (v. 30) for without these, however great the zeal they showed, they would be striving to no purpose. God assented to their prayer, and manifested this, by shaking the place. For \"when they had prayed,\" it is said, \"the place was shaken. (v. 31.) And wherefore this was done, hear from the prophet, when he says, \"He looketh on the earth, and maketh it to tremble. (Ps. civ. 32.) For by this He made it manifest that He is present to their prayers. And again, another prophet saith, \"The earth was shaken, and did tremble at the presence of the Lord.\" (Ps. xviii. 7; lxviii, 8.) And God did this, both to make it more awful, and to lead them on to a courageous trust. \"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.\" They[fn-6-P604_443689:11-nf] gained increased boldness. As it was the beginning (of their work), and they had besought a sensible sign for their persuasion (proj to peisqhnai autouj)-but after this we nowhere find the like happening-therefore great was the encouragement they received. In fact, they had no means of proving that He was risen, save by miraculous signs. So that it was not only their own assurance (asfaleian) that they sought: but that they might not be put to shame, but that they might speak with boldness. \"The place was shaken,\" and that made them all the more unshaken. For this is sometimes a token of wrath, sometimes of favor and providence, but on the present occasion, of wrath. For[fn-6-P605_444876:12-nf] in those times it took place in an unusual manner. Thus, at the Crucifixion, the earth was shaken: and the Lord Himself says, \"Then there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places. (Matt. xxiv. 7.) But then the wrath of which it was a sign was against the adversaries: as for the disciples, it filled them with the Spirit. Observe, even the Apostles, after the prayer, are \"filled with the Holy Ghost.\" \"And[fn-6-P606_445934:13-nf] the multitudes of them that believed,\" etc. (v. 32.) Great, you perceive, is the virtue of this thing, seeing their was need of this (grace) even in that Company. For this is the foundation of all that is good, this of which he now for the second time makes mention, exhorting all men to the. contempt of riches: \"Neither[fn-6-P607_446577:14-nf] said any of them that aught of the things he possessed was his own,\" \"but they had all things common.\" For that this was in consequence not merely of the miraculous signs, but of their own purpose, is manifest by the case of Sapphira and Ananias. \"And with great power gave the Apostles witness,\" etc. (v. 33.) Not in word, but with power the Apostles exhibited their testimony of the Resurrection: just as Paul saith, \"And my preaching was not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with manifestation of the Spirit and of power.\" And it is not merely, With power, but, \"With great power.\" (1 Cor. ii. 4.) \"And great grace,\" it says, \"was upon them all; for neither was there any among them that lacked. (v. 34.) This is why the grace (was upon them all,) for that \"there was none that lacked:\" that is, from the exceeding ardor of the givers, none was in want. For they did not give in part, and in part reserve: nor yet in giving all, give it as their own. And they lived moreover in great abundance: they removed all inequality from among them, and made a goodly order. \"For as many as were possessors,\" etc. And with great respect they did this: for they did not presume to give into their hands, nor did they ostentatiously present, but brought to the Apostles' feet. To them they left it to be the dispensers, made them the owners, that thenceforth all should be defrayed as from common, not from private, property.[fn-6-P608_448229:15-nf] This was also a help to them against vain-glory. If this were done now, we should ire more pleasant lives, both rich and poor, nor would it be more pleasant to the poor than to the rich themselves. And if you please, let us now for awhile depict it in words, and derive at least this pleasure from it, since you have no mind for it in your actions. For at any rate this is evident, even from the facts which took place then, that by selling their possessions they did not come to be in need, but made them rich that were in need. However, let us now depict this state of things in words, and let all sell their possessions, and bring them into the common stock-in words, I mean: let none be excited, rich or poor. How much gold think you would be collected? For my part, I conjecture-for of course it is not possible to speak exactly-that supposing all here, men and women, to empty out their whole property, lands, possessions, houses,-for I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they sat at liberty,-perhaps ten hundred thousand pounds weight of gold would be the amount collected: nay, twice or thrice as much. For consider; at what number of \"juga\"[fn-6-P609_451967:16-nf] (yokes) is our city rated? How many (of the population) shall we say are Christians? shall we say an hundred thousand, and the rest Greeks and Jews? Then what thousands (of pounds)of gold would be collected! And what is the number of poor? I do not think more than fifty thousand. Then to feed that number daily, what abundance there would bet And yet if the food were received in common, all taking their meals together, it would require no such great outlay after all. But, you will ask, what should we do after the money was spent? And do you think it ever could be spent? Would not the grace of God be ten thousand fold greater? Would not the grace of God be indeed richly poured out? Nay, should we not make it a heaven upon earth? If, where the numbers were three thousand and five thousand, the doing of this thing had such splendid success, and none of them complained of poverty, how much more glorious would this be in so vast a multitude? And even of those that are without, who would not contribute?-But, to show that it is the living separately that is expensive and causes poverty, let there be a house in which are ten children: and the wife and the man, let the one work at her wool, the other bring his earnings from his outdoor occupation: now tell me, in which way would these spend most? by taking their meals together and occupying one house, or by living separately? Of course, by living separately. For if the ten children must live apart, they would need ten several rooms, ten tables, ten attendants, and the income otherwise in proportion. Is it not for this very reason, that where there is a great number of servants, they have all one table, that the expense may not be so great? For so it is, division always makes diminution, concord and agreement make increase. The dwellers in the monasteries live just as the faithful did then: now did ever any of these die of hunger? was ever any of them not provided for with plenty of everything? Now, it seems, people are more afraid of this than of falling into a boundless and bottomless deep. But if we had made actual trial of this,[fn-6-P610_455011:17-nf] then indeed we should boldly venture upon this plan (tou pragmatoj). What grace too, think you, would there not be! For if at that time, when there was no believer but only the three thousand and the five thousand: when all, throughout the world, were enemies, when they could nowhere look for comfort, they yet boldly entered upon this plan with such success; how much more would this be the case now, when by the grace of God there are believers everywhere throughout the world? What Gentile would be left? For my part, I think there would not be one: we should so attract all, and draw them to us? But yet if we do but make[fn-6-P611_455950:18-nf] fair progress, I trust in God that even this shall be realized. Only do as I say, and let us successfully achieve things in their regular order; if God grant life, I trust that we shall soon bring you over to this way of life.","title":"Homily XI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_111_treatise_i_on_the_unity_of_the_church_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-05","text":"6.

Therefore, be a man guilty of unbelief, or a perfect believer, he does not in either case beget faithful children, but sinners; in the same way that the seeds, not only of a wild olive, but also of a cultivated one, produce not cultivated olives, but wild ones. So, likewise, his first birth holds a man in that bondage from which nothing but his second birth delivers him.

For the two parts of the number seven (which commonly symbolizes totality), that is to say four and three, multiplied into one another, give twelve.

God calls out to Adam,[fn-46-P4675_1493266:328-nf] Where art thou? as if ignorant where he was; and when he alleged that the shame of his nakedness was the cause (of his hiding himself), He inquired whether he had eaten of the tree, as if He were in doubt. By no means;[fn-46-P4676_1493508:329-nf] God was neither uncertain about the commission of the sin, nor ignorant of Adam's whereabouts. It was certainly proper to summon the offender, who was concealing himself from the consciousness of his sin, and to bring him forth into the presence of his Lord, not merely by the calling out of his name, but with a home-thrust blow[fn-46-P4677_1493852:330-nf] at the sin which he had at that moment committed. For the question ought not to be read in a merely interrogative tone, Where art thou, Adam? but with an impressive and earnest voice, and with an air of imputation, Oh, Adam, where art thou?-as much as to intimate: thou art no longer here, thou art in perdition-so that the voice is the utterance of One who is at once rebuking and sorrowing.[fn-46-P4678_1494266:331-nf] But of course some part of paradise had escaped the eye of Him who holds the universe in His hand as if it were a bird's nest, and to whom heaven is a throne and earth a footstool; so that He could not see, before He summoned him forth, where Adam was, both while lurking and when eating of the forbidden fruit! The wolf or the paltry thief escapes not the notice of the keeper of your vineyard or your garden! And God, I suppose, with His keener vision,[fn-46-P4679_1494737:332-nf] from on high was unable to miss the sight of[fn-46-P4680_1494802:333-nf] aught which lay beneath Him! Foolish heretic, who treat with scorn[fn-46-P4681_1494888:334-nf] so fine an argument of God's greatness and man's instruction! God put the question with an appearance of uncertainty, in order that even here He might prove man to be the subject of a free will in the alternative of either a denial or a confession, and give to him the opportunity of freely acknowledging his transgression, and, so far,[fn-46-P4682_1495238:335-nf] of lightening it.[fn-46-P4683_1495276:336-nf] In like manner He inquires of Cain where his brother was, just as if He had not yet heard the blood of Abel crying from the ground, in order that he too might have the opportunity from the same power of the will of spontaneously denying, and to this degree aggravating, his crime; and that thus there might be supplied to us examples of confessing sins rather than of denying them: so that even then was initiated the evangelic doctrine, \"By thy words[fn-46-P4684_1495746:337-nf] thou shall be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\"[fn-46-P4685_1495859:338-nf] Now, although Adam was by reason of his condition under law[fn-46-P4686_1495941:339-nf] subject to death, yet was hope preserved to him by the Lord's saying, \"Behold, Adam is become as one of us; \"[fn-46-P4687_1496080:340-nf] that is, in consequence of the future taking of the man into the divine nature. Then what follows? \"And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, (and eat), and live for ever.\" Inserting thus the particle of present time, \"And now,\" He shows that He had made for a time, and at present, a prolongation of man's life. Therefore He did not actually[fn-46-P4688_1496493:341-nf] curse Adam and Eve, for they were candidates for restoration, and they had been relieved[fn-46-P4689_1496635:342-nf] by confession. Cain, however, He not only cursed; but when he wished to atone for his sin by death, He even prohibited his dying, so that he had to bear the load of this prohibition in addition to his crime. This, then, will prove to be the ignorance of our God, which was simulated on this account, that delinquent man should not be unaware of what he ought to do. Coming down to the case of Sodom and Gomorrha, he says: \"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\"[fn-46-P4690_1497214:343-nf] Well, was He in this instance also uncertain through ignorance, and desiring to know? Or was this a necessary tone of utterance, as expressive of a minatory and not a dubious sense, under the colour of an inquiry?

By Isaiah the Lord called these wealthy ladies-\"Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice\"[fn-59-P5994_1803340:702-nf] -that He might prove[fn-59-P5995_1803604:703-nf] them first as disciples, and then as assistants and helpers: \"Daughters, hear my words in hope; this day of the year cherish the memory of, in labour with hope.\" For it was \"in labour\" that they followed Him, and \"with hope\" did they minister to Him. On the subject of parables, let it suffice that it has been once for all shown that this kind of language[fn-59-P5996_1803980:704-nf] was with equal distinctness promised by the Creator. But there is that direct mode of His speaking[fn-59-P5997_1804095:705-nf] to the people\"Ye shall hear with the ear, but ye shall not understand\"[fn-59-P5998_1804187:706-nf] -which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\"[fn-59-P5999_1804352:707-nf] Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the exhortation followed the threatening. First came, \"Ye shall hear with the ear, but shall not understand; \"then followed, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" For they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, was teaching them that it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and with these the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, \"Take heed how ye hear,\"[fn-60-P6000_1804931:708-nf] and hear not,-meaning, of course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only attach a proper, sense to the Creator's admonition[fn-60-P6001_1805097:709-nf] suitable to the meaning of Him who was rousing the people to hear by the words, \"Take heed how ye hear,\" it amounted to a menace to such as would not hear. In fact,[fn-60-P6002_1805285:710-nf] that most merciful god of yours, who judges not, neither is angry, is minatory. This is proved even by the sentence which immediately follows: \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.\"[fn-60-P6003_1805589:711-nf] What shall be given? The increase of faith, or understanding, or even salvation. What shall be taken away? That, of course, which shall be, given. By whom shall the gift and the deprivation be made? If by the Creator it be taken away, by Him also shall it be given. If by Marcion's god it be given, by Marcion's god also will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the \"deprivation,\" it will not be the work of a god who knows not how to threaten, because incapable of anger. I am, moreover, astonished when he says that \"a candle is not usually hidden,\"[fn-60-P6004_1806183:712-nf] who had hidden himself-a greater and more needful light-during so long a time; and when he promises that \"everything shall be brought out of its secrecy and made manifest,\"[fn-60-P6005_1806378:713-nf] who hitherto has kept his god in obscurity, waiting (I suppose) until Marcion be born. We now come to the most strenuously-plied argument of all those who call in question the Lord's nativity. They say that He testifies Himself to His not having been born, when He asks, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"[fn-60-P6006_1806717:714-nf] In this manner heretics either wrest plain and simple words to any sense they choose by their conjectures, or else they violently resolve by a literal interpretation words which imply a conditional sense and are incapable of a simple solution,[fn-60-P6007_1806983:715-nf] as in this passage. We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to see Him, if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been known to him who announced them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, when they desired to see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first position this answer is usually given by the other side. But suppose they sent Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him? Well, but the Scripture does not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is done in the way of temptation (\"Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him; \"[fn-60-P6008_1807770:716-nf] again, when inquiring about tribute, the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him[fn-60-P6009_1807866:717-nf] ), so, when it makes no mention of temptation, it does not admit the interpretation of temptation. However, although I do not allow this sense, I may as well ask, by way of a superfluous refutation, for the reasons of the alleged temptation, To what purpose could they have tempted Him by naming His mother and His brethren? If it was to ascertain whether He had been born or not-when was a question raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting Him in this way? Who could doubt His having been born, when they[fn-60-P6010_1808409:718-nf] saw Him before them a veritable man?-whom they had heard call Himself \"Son of man? \"-of whom they doubted whether He were God or Son of God, from seeing Him, as they did, in the perfect garb of human quality?-supposing Him rather to be a prophet, a great one indeed,[fn-60-P6011_1808752:719-nf] but still one who had been born as man? Even if it had been necessary that He should thus be tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other proof would have better answered the trial than that to be obtained from mentioning those relatives which it was quite possible for Him, in spite of His true nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does a mother live on contemporaneously[fn-60-P6012_1809220:720-nf] with her sons in every case? Have all sons brothers born for them?[fn-60-P6013_1809303:721-nf] May a man rather not have fathers and sisters (living), or even no relatives at all? But there is historical proof[fn-60-P6014_1809440:722-nf] that at this very time[fn-60-P6015_1809516:723-nf] a census had been taken in Judµa by Sentius Saturninus,[fn-60-P6016_1809640:724-nf] which might have satisfied their inquiry respecting the family and descent of Christ. Such a method of testing the point had therefore no consistency whatever in it and they \"who were standing without\" were really \"His mother and His brethren.\" It remains for us to examine His meaning when He resorts to non-literal[fn-60-P6017_1811442:725-nf] words, saying \"Who is my mother or my brethren? \"It seems as if His language amounted to a denial of His family and His birth; but it arose actually from the absolute nature of the case, and the conditional sense in which His words were to be explained.[fn-60-P6018_1811791:726-nf] He was justly indignant, that persons so very near to Him\" stood without,\" while strangers were within hanging on His words, especially as they wanted to call Him away from the solemn work He had in hand. He did not so much deny as disavow[fn-60-P6019_1812120:727-nf] them. And therefore, when to the previous question, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?[fn-60-P6020_1812353:728-nf] He added the answer \"None but they who hear my words and do them,\" He transferred the names of blood-relationship to others, whom He judged to be more closely related to Him by reason of their faith. Now no one transfers a thing except from him who possesses that which is transferred. If, therefore, He made them \"His mother and His brethren\" who were not so, how could He deny them these relationships who really had them? Surely only on the condition of their deserts, and not by any disavowal of His near relatives; teaching them by His own actual example,[fn-60-P6021_1812984:729-nf] that \"whosoever preferred father or mother or brethren to the Word of God, was not a disciple worthy of Him.\"[fn-60-P6022_1813115:730-nf] Besides,[fn-60-P6023_1813144:731-nf] His admission of His mother and His brethren was the more express, from the fact of His unwillingness to acknowledge them. That He adopted others only confirmed those in their relationship to Him whom He refused because of their offence, and for whom He substituted the others, not as being truer relatives, but worthier ones. Finally, it was no great matter if He did prefer to kindred (that) faith which it[fn-60-P6024_1813569:732-nf] did not possess.[fn-60-P6025_1813643:733-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_22_psalm_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"14. In the book of Genesis[fn-24-P2452_1565729:12-nf] , where the lawgiver depicts the paradise planted by God, we are shewn that every tree is fair to look upon and good for food; it is also stated that there stands in the midst of the garden a tree of Life and a tree of the knowledge of good and evil; next that the garden is watered by a stream that afterwards divides into four heads. The Prophet Solomon teaches us what this tree of Life is in his exhortation concerning Wisdom: She is a tree of life to all them that lay hold upon her, and lean upon her[fn-24-P2453_1566253:13-nf] . This tree then is living; and not only living, but, furthermore, guided by reason; guided by reason, that is, in so far as to yield fruit, and that not casually nor unseasonably, but in its own season. And this tree is planted beside the rills of water in the domain of the Kingdom of God, that is, of course, in Paradise, and in the place where the stream as it issues forth is divided into four heads. For he does not say, Behind the rills of water, but, Beside the rills of water, at the place where first the heads receive each their flow of waters.

And now that we have shewn upon prophetic warrant that Wisdom, which is Christ, is called the tree of Life in accordance with the mystery of the coming Incarnation and Passion, we must go on to find support for the strict truth of this interpretation from the Gospels. The Lord with His own lips compared Himself to a tree when the Jews said that He cast out devils in Beelzebub: Either make the tree good, said He, and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; far the tree is known by its fruits[fn-24-P2455_1567573:15-nf] ; because although to cast out devils is an excellent fruit, they said He was Beelzebab, whose fruits are abominable. Nor yet did He hesitate to teach that the power that makes the tree happy resided in His Person, when on the way to the Cross He said: For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry[fn-24-P2456_1567927:16-nf] ?

Accordingly, when Matthew says, \"And when He was departed thence, He came into their synagogue,\" the words do indeed import that the said coming did not take place until after He had departed from the previously mentioned locality; but, at the same time, they leave the question undecided as to the number of days which may have elapsed between His passing from the aforesaid corn-field and His coming into their synagogue; and they express nothing as to His going there in direct and immediate succession. And thus space is offered us for getting in the narrative of Luke, who tells us that it was on another Sabbath that this man's hand was restored. But it is possible that a difficulty may be felt in the circumstance that Matthew has told us how the people put this question to the Lord, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day?\" wishing thereby to find an occasion for accusing Him; and that in reply He set before them the parable of the sheep in these terms: \"What man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?

Matthew continues his account thus: \"And when He was departed thence, He went into their synagogue: and, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered;\" and so on, down to the words, \"And it was restored whole, like as the other.\"[fn-18-P1840_751574:344-nf] The restoring of this man who had the withered hand is also not passed over in silence by Mark and Luke.[fn-18-P1841_751703:345-nf] Now, the circumstance that this day is also designated a Sabbath might possibly lead us to suppose that both the plucking of the ears of corn and the healing of this man took place on the same day, were it not that Luke has made it plain that it was on a different Sabbath that the cure of the withered hand was wrought. Accordingly, when Matthew says, \"And when He was departed thence, He came into their synagogue,\" the words do indeed import that the said coming did not take place until after He had departed from the previously mentioned locality; but, at the same time, they leave the question undecided as to the number of days which may have elapsed between His passing from the aforesaid corn-field and His coming into their synagogue; and they express nothing as to His going there in direct and immediate succession. And thus space is offered us for getting in the narrative of Luke, who tells us that it was on another Sabbath that this man's hand was restored. But it is possible that a difficulty may be felt in the circumstance that Matthew has told us how the people put this question to the Lord, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day?\" wishing thereby to find an occasion for accusing Him; and that in reply He set before them the parable of the sheep in these terms: \"What man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?

Moreover, with regard to other matters which are left unmentioned in this section both by Mark and by Luke, no difficulty can be raised by these. Neither can that be the case with some other circumstances which are related by them in somewhat different terms, for the sense still remains the same.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"211","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"86. Matthew goes on and relates what followed thus: \"Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign of thee;\" and so on, down to where we read, \"Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.\"[fn-18-P1865_760087:357-nf] These words are recorded also by Luke in this connection, although in a somewhat different order.[fn-18-P1866_760207:358-nf] For he has mentioned the fact that they sought of the Lord a sign from heaven at an earlier point in his narrative, which makes it follow immediately on his version of the miracle wrought on the dumb man. He has not, however, recorded there the reply which was given to them by the Lord. But further on, after [telling us how] the people were gathered together, he states that this answer was returned to the persons who, as he gives us to understand, were mentioned by him in those earlier verses as seeking of Him a sign from heaven. And that reply he also subjoins, only after introducing the passage regarding the woman who said to the Lord, \"Blessed is the womb that bare thee.\"[fn-18-P1867_760914:359-nf] This notice of the woman, moreover, he inserts after relating the Lord's discourse concerning the unclean spirit that goes out of the man, and then returns and finds the house garnished. In this way, then, after the notice of the woman, and after his statement of the reply which was made to the multitudes on the subject of the sign which they sought from heaven, he brings in the similitude of the prophet Jonas; and then, directly continuing the Lord's discourse, he next instances what was said concerning the Queen of the South and the Ninevites. Thus he has rather related something which Matthew has passed over in silence, than omitted any of the facts which that evangelist has narrated in this place. And furthermore, who can fail to perceive that the question as to the precise order in which these words were uttered by the Lord is a superfluous one? For this lesson also we ought to learn, on the unimpeachable authority of the evangelists,-namely, that no offence against truth need be supposed on the part of a writer, although he may not reproduce the discourse of some speaker in the precise order in which the person from whose lips it proceeded might have given it; the fact being, that the mere item of the order, whether it be this or that, does not affect the subject-matter itself. And by his present version Luke indicates that this discourse of the Lord was of greater length than we might otherwise have supposed; and he records certain topics handled in it, which resemble those which are mentioned by Matthew in his recital of the sermon which was delivered on the mount.[fn-18-P1868_762534:360-nf] So that we take these words to have been spoken twice over, to wit, on that previous occasion, and again on this one. But on the conclusion of this discourse Luke proceeds to another subject, as to which it is uncertain whether, in the account which he gives of it, he has kept by the order of actual occurrence. For he connects it in this way: \"And as He spake, a certain Pharisee besought Him to dine with him.\"[fn-18-P1869_762970:361-nf] He does not say, however, \"as He spake these words,\" but only \"as He spake.\" For if he had said, \"as He spake these words,\" the expression would of course have compelled us to suppose that the incidents referred to, besides being recorded by him in this order, also took place on the Lord's part in that same order.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"213","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"87. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: \"While He yet talked to the people, behold, His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to speak to Him;\" and so on, down to the words, \"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.\"[fn-18-P1873_763892:362-nf] Without doubt, we ought to understand this to have occurred in immediate sequence on the preceding incidents. For he has prefaced his transition to this narrative by the words, \"While He yet talked to the people;\" and what does this term \"yet\" refer to, but to the very matter of which He was speaking on that occasion? For the expression is not, \"When He talked to the people, Behold, His mother and His brethren;\" but, \"While He was yet speaking,\" etc. And that phraseology compels us to suppose that it was at the very time when He was still engaged in speaking of those things which were mentioned immediately above. For Mark has also related what our Lord said after His declaration on the subject of the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. He gives it thus: \"And there came His mother and His brethren,\"[fn-18-P1874_764726:363-nf] omitting certain matters which meet us in the context connected with that discourse of the Lord, and which Matthew has introduced there with greater fulness than Mark, and Luke, again, with greater fulness than Matthew. On the other hand, Luke has not kept the historical order in the report which he offers of this incident, but has given it by anticipation, and has narrated it as he recalled it to memory, at a point antecedent to the date of its literal occurrence. But furthermore, he has brought it in in such a manner that it appears dissociated from any close connection either with what precedes it or with what follows it. For, after reporting certain of the Lord's parables, he has introduced his notice of what took place with His mother and His brethren in the following manner: \"Then came to Him His mother and His brethren, and could not come at Him for the press.\"[fn-18-P1875_765631:364-nf] Thus he has not explained at what precise time it was that they came to Him. And again, when he passes off from this subject, he proceeds in these terms: \"Now it came to pass on one of the days, that He went into a ship with His disciples.\"[fn-18-P1876_765894:365-nf] And certainly, when he employs this expression, \"it came to pass on one of the days,\" he indicates clearly enough that we are under no necessity of supposing that the day meant was the very day on which this incident took place, or the one following in immediate succession. Consequently, neither in the matter of the Lord's words, nor in that of the historical order of the occurrences related, does Matthew's account of the incident which occurred in connection with the mother and the brethren of the Lord, exhibit any want of harmony with the versions given of the same by the other two evangelists.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":53,"source_paragraph":"243","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"106. Matthew continues as follows: \"And He sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magedan;\" and so on, down to the words, \"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonas.\"[fn-19-P1973_819262:421-nf] This has already been recorded in another connection by the same Matthew.[fn-19-P1974_819364:422-nf] Hence again and again we must hold by the position that the Lord spake the same words on repeated occasions; so that when any completely irreconcilable difference appears between statements of His utterances, we are to understand the words to have been spoken twice over. In this case, indeed, Mark also keeps the same order; and after his account of the miracle of the seven loaves, subjoins the same intimation as is given us in Matthew, only with this difference, that Matthew's expression for the locality is not Dalmanutha, as is read in certain codices, but Magedan.[fn-19-P1975_819959:423-nf] There is no reason, however, for questioning the fact that it is the same place that is intended under both names. For most codices, even of Mark's Gospel, give no other reading than that of Magedan.[fn-19-P1976_820185:424-nf] Neither should any difficulty be felt in the fact that Mark does not say, as Matthew does, that in the answer which the Lord returned to those who sought after a sign, He referred to Jonah, but mentions simply that He replied in these terms: \"There shall no sign be given unto it.\" For we are given to understand what kind of sign they asked-namely, one from heaven.

Matthew proceeds with his account, observing the following order of narration: \"Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to His disciples, saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not;\" and so on, down to the words, \"Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2155_897225:517-nf] Luke also mentions a similar discourse which was spoken by the Lord in opposition to the Pharisees and the scribes and the doctors of the law, but reports it as delivered in the house of a certain Pharisee, who had invited Him to a feast. In order to relate that passage, he has made a digression from the order which is followed by Matthew, about the point at which they have both put on record the Lord's sayings respecting the sign of the three days and nights in the history of Jonas, and the queen of the south, and the unclean spirit that returns and finds the house swept.[fn-21-P2156_897825:518-nf] And that paragraph is followed up by Matthew with these words: \"While He yet talked to the people, behold, His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to speak with Him.\" But in the version which the third Gospel presents of the discourse then spoken by the Lord, after the recital of certain sayings of the Lord which Matthew has omitted to notice, Luke turns off from the order which he had been observing in concert with Matthew, to that his immediately subsequent narrative runs thus: \"And as He spake, a certain Pharisee besought Him to dine with him: and He went in, and sat down to meat. And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that He had not first washed before dinner. And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and platter.\"[fn-21-P2157_898637:519-nf] And after this, Luke reports other utterances which were directed against the said Pharisees and scribes and teachers of the law, which are of a similar tenor to those which Matthew also recounts in this passage which we have taken in hand at present to consider.[fn-21-P2158_898924:520-nf] Wherefore, although Matthew records these things in a manner which, while it is true indeed that the house of that Pharisee is not mentioned by name, yet does not specify as the scene where the words were spoken any place entirely inconsistent with the idea of His having been in the house referred to; still the facts that the Lord by this time [i.e. according to Matthew's Gospel] had left Galilee and come into Jerusalem, and that the incidents alluded to above, on to the discourse which is now under review,[fn-21-P2159_899460:521-nf] are so arranged in the context after His arrival as to make it only reasonable to understand them to have taken place in Jerusalem, whereas Luke's narrative deals with what occurred at the time when the Lord as yet was only journeying towards Jerusalem, are considerations which lead me to the conclusion that these are not the same, but only two similar discourses, of which the former evangelist has reported the one, and the latter the other.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_29_on_the_profit_of_believing_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6. All these ways our Lord Jesus Christ and His Apostles used. For when it had been objected that His disciples had plucked the ears of corn on the sabbath-day, the instance was taken from history; \"Have ye not read,\" saith He, \"what David did when he was an hungered, and they that were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?\"[fn-34-P3408_1569436:9-nf] But the instance pertains to aetiology, that, when Christ had forbidden a wife to be put away, save for the cause of fornication, and they, who asked Him, had alleged that Moses had granted permission after a writing of divorcement had been given, This, saith He, \"Moses did because of the hardness of your heart.\"[fn-34-P3409_1569772:10-nf] For here a reason was given, why that had been well allowed by Moses for a time; that this command of Christ might seem to show that now the times were other.

For that both history of the Old Testament, and aetiology, and analogy are found in the New Testament, has been, as I think, sufficiently proved: it remains to show this of allegory. Our Redeemer Himself in the Gospel uses allegory out of the Old Testament. \"This generation,\" saith He, \"seeketh a sign, and there shall not be given it save the sign of Jonas the prophet. For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so also shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\"[fn-34-P3417_1574099:16-nf] For why should I speak of the ApOstle Paul, who in his first Epistle to the Corinthians shows that even the very history of the Exodus was an allegory of the future Christian People. \"But I would not that ye should be ignorant, brethren, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses, in the cloud, and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual Rock that followed with them; and that Rock was Christ. But in the more part of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. But these things were figures of us,[fn-34-P3418_1574812:17-nf] that we be not lustful of evil things, as they also lusted. Neither let us worship idols, as certain of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as certain of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand men. Neither let us tempt Christ, as certain of them tempted, and perished of serpents. Neither murmur we, as certain of them murmured, and perished of the destroyer.

For the same Paul says to the Galatians, \"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one of a bond-maid, and one of a free woman. But he who was of the bond-maid was born after the flesh: but he who was of the free woman, by promise: which things were spoken by way of allegory.[fn-34-P3421_1576023:20-nf] For these are the two Testaments, one of Mount Sinai gendering unto bondage, which is Agar: for Sinai is a mount in Arabia, which bordereth[fn-34-P3422_1576188:21-nf] upon that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

Regarding the Sabbath and circumcision, and the distinction in foods, in which you say the teaching of Moses differs from what Christians are taught by Christ, we have already shown that, as the apostle says, \"all those things were our examples.\"[fn-17-P1732_976086:49-nf] The difference is not in the doctrine, but in the time. There was a time when it was proper that these things should be figuratively predicted; and there is now a different time when it is proper that they should be openly declared and fully accomplished. It is not surprising that the Jews, who understood the Sabbath in a carnal sense, should oppose Christ, who began to open up its spiritual meaning. Reply, if you can, to the apostle, who declares that the rest of the Sabbath was a shadow of something future.[fn-17-P1733_976620:50-nf] If the Jews opposed Christ because they did not understand what the true Sabbath is, there is no reason why you should oppose Him, or refuse to learn what true innocence is. For on that occasion when Jesus appears especially to set aside the Sabbath, when His disciples were hungry, and pulled the ears of corn through which they were passing, and ate them, Jesus, in replying to the Jews, declared His disciples to be innocent. \"If you knew,\" He said \"what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the innocent.\"[fn-17-P1734_977196:51-nf] They should rather have pitied the wants of the disciples, for hunger forced them to do what they did. But pulling ears of corn, which is innocence in the teaching of Christ, is murder in the teaching of Manichaeus. Or was it an act of charity in the apostles to pull the ears of corn, that they might in eating set free the members of God, as in your foolish notions? Then it must be cruelty in you not to do the same. Faustus' reason for setting aside the Sabbath is because he knows that God's power is exercised without cessation, and without weariness. It is for those to say this, who believe that all times are the production of an eternal act of God's will. But you will find it difficult to reconcile this with your doctrine, that the rebellion of the race of darkness broke your god's rest, which was also disturbed by a sudden attack of the enemy; or perhaps God never had rest, as he foresaw this from eternity, and could not feel at ease in the prospect of so dire a conflict, with such loss and disaster to his members.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_116_tractate_cxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. But as we have already, in a way proportionate to the brevity of our discourse, spoken of the objects of the promise, and of its own stability; let us now look at this one point, as far as we are able, what it is that He was pleased to promise when He said, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am.\" As far as pertains to the creaturehood wherein He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,[fn-35-P3572_1982634:6-nf] not even He Himself was yet where He would afterwards be: but He could say in this way, \"where I am,\" to let us understand that He was soon to ascend into heaven, so that He spake of Himself as being already there, where He was presently to be. He could do so also in the same way as He had said on a former occasion, when speaking to Nicodemus, \"No man ascendeth into heaven, save He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-35-P3573_1983100:7-nf] For there also He did not say, Will be, but \"is,\" because of the oneness of person, wherein God is at once man, and man God. He promised, therefore, that we should be in heaven; for thither the servant-form, which He received of the Virgin, has been elevated, and set at the right hand of the Father. Because of the same blessed hope the apostle also says: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ; by whose grace we are saved; and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-35-P3574_1983744:8-nf] And so accordingly we may understand the Lord to have said, \"That where I am, there they may be also.\" He, indeed, said of Himself that He was there already; but of us He merely declared that He wished us to be there with Him, without any indication that we were there already But what the Lord said that He wished to be done, the apostle spake of as already accomplished. For he said not, He will yet raise us up, and make us sit in heavenly places; but, \"hath raised us up, and made us sit in heavenly places:\" for it is not without good grounds, but in believing assurance, that he reckons as already done what he is certain will yet be done. But if it is in respect of the form of God, wherein He is equal to the Father, that we would be inclined to understand His words, \"I will that they also be with me, where I am,\" let our mind get quit of every thought of material images: whateverthe soul has had presented to it, that is endowed with length, or breadth, or thickness, tinted by the light with any sort of bodily hue, or diffused through local space of any kind, whether finite or infinite, let it, as far as possible, turn away from all such notions the glance of its contemplation on the inward bent of its thoughts. And let us not be making inquiries as to where the Son, the Father's co-equal, is, since no one has yet found out where He is not. But if any one would inquire, let him inquire rather how he may be with Him; not everywhere as He is, but wherever He may be. For when He said to the man that was expiating his crimes on the tree, and making confession unto salvation, \"Today shall thou be with me in paradise,\"[fn-35-P3575_1985400:9-nf] in respect to His human nature His own soul was on that very day to be in hell,[fn-35-P3576_1985500:10-nf] His flesh in the sepulchre; but as respected His Godhead He was certainly also in paradise. And therefore the soul of the thief, absolved from his by-gone crimes, and already in the blessed enjoyment of His grace, although it could not be everywhere as He was, yet could on that very day be also with Him in paradise, from which He, who is always everywhere, had not withdrawn. On this account, doubtless, it was not enough for Him to say, \"I will that they also be where I am;\" but He added, \"with me.\" For to be with Him is the chief good. For even the miserable can be where He is, since wheresoever any are, there is He also; but the blessed only are with Him, because it is only of Him that they can be blessed. Was it not truly said to God, \"If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there; and if I go down into hell, Thou art present?\"[fn-35-P3577_1986354:11-nf] or is not Christ after all that Wisdom of God which \"penetrateth everywhere because of its purity\"?[fn-35-P3578_1986474:12-nf] But the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.[fn-35-P3579_1986567:13-nf] And similarly, to take a kind of illustration from what is visible, although greatly unlike, as the blind man, even though he be where the light is, is yet not himself with the light, but is really absent from that which is present; so the unbeliever and profane, or even the believer and pious, because not yet competent to gaze on the light of wisdom, although he cannot be anywhere that Christ is not there likewise, yet is not himself with Christ, I mean in actual sight. For we cannot doubt that the true believer is with Christ by faith; because in reference to this He saith, \"He that is not with me is against me.\"[fn-35-P3580_1987207:14-nf] But when He said to God the Father, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am,\" He spake exclusively of that sight wherein we shall see Him as He is.[fn-35-P3581_1987404:15-nf] ","title":"Tractate CXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"11. \"Every kingdom divided against itself shall quickly be overthrown,\" saith the Lord.

For the space of three days, which elapsed between the Lord's death and resurrection, cannot be correctly understood except in the light of that form of expression according to which the part is dealt with as the whole.[fn-26-P2619_1136247:267-nf] For He said Himself, \"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\"[fn-26-P2620_1136442:268-nf] Now, in whichever way we reckon the times, whether from the point when He yielded up the ghost, or from the date of his burial, the sum does not come out clearly, unless we take the intermediate day, that is to say, the Sabbath, as a complete day-in other words, a full day along with its night,-and, on the other hand, understand those days between which that one intervenes-that is to say, the day of the preparation and the first day of the week, which we designate the Lord's day-to be dealt with on the principle of the part standing for the whole. For of what avail is it that some, hard pressed by these difficulties, and not knowing the very large part which the mode of expression referred to-namely, that which takes the part as the whole-plays in the matter of solving the problems presented in the Holy Scriptures, have struck out the idea of reckoning as a distinct night those three hours, namely, from the sixth hour to the ninth, during which the sun was darkened, and as a distinct day the other three hours, during which the sun was restored again to the lands, that is to say, from the ninth hour on to its setting? For the night connected with the coming Sabbath follows, and if we compute it along with its day, there will then be two days and two nights. But, further, after the Sabbath there comes in the night connected with the first day of the week, that is to say, with the dawning of the Lord's day, which was the time when the Lord arose. Consequently, the result to which this mode of calculation leads us will be just two days and two nights, and one night, even supposing it possible to take the last as a complete night, and taking it for granted that we were not to show that the said dawn was in reality the ultimate portion of the same. Thus it would appear that, even although we were to compute these six hours in that fashion, during three of which the sun was darkened, and during the other three of which it shone forth again, we would not establish a satisfactory reckoning of three days and three nights. In accordance, therefore, with the usage which meets us so frequently in the language of the Scriptures, and which deals with the part as the whole, it remains for us to hold the time of the preparation to constitute the day at the one extremity,[fn-26-P2621_1138858:269-nf] on which the Lord was crucified and buried, and, from that limit, to find one whole day along with its night which was fully spent. In this way, too, we must take the intermediate member, that is to say the day of the Sabbath, not as calculated simply from the part, but as a really complete day. The third day, again, must be computed from its first part; that is to say, calculating from the night, we must look upon it as making up a whole day when its day-portion is connected with it. Thus we shall get a space of three days, on the analogy of a case already considered, namely, those eight days after which the Lord went up into a mountain; with respect to which period we find that Matthew and Mark, fixing their attention simply on the complete days intervening, have put it thus, \"After six days,\" whereas Luke's representation of the same is this, \"An eight days after.\"[fn-26-P2622_1139783:270-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_15_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6. Mark proceeds as follows: \"In those days again,[fn-27-P2771_1224690:17-nf] the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat;\" and so on, down to the words, \"John answered Him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbade him.[fn-27-P2772_1225121:18-nf] But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me; for he that is not against you is on your side.\"[fn-27-P2773_1225539:19-nf] Luke relates this in similar terms, with this exception, that he does not insert the clause, \"for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me.\" Consequently, there is nothing here to raise the question of any discrepancy between these two. We must see, however, whether this sentence must be supposed to stand in opposition to another of the Lord's sayings, namely, the one to this effect, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"[fn-27-P2774_1226088:20-nf] For how was this man not against Him, who was notwith Him, and of whom John reported that he did not unite with them in following Him, if he is against Him who is not with Him? Or if the man was against Him, how does He say to the disciples, \"Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is on your side\"? Will any one aver that it is of consequence to observe that here He says to the disciples, \"He that is not against you is on your side;\" whereas, in the other passage, He spoke of Himself in the terms, \"He that is not with me is against me\"? That would make it appear, indeed, as if it were possible for one not to be with Him, although he was associated with those disciples of His who are, so to speak; His very members. Besides, how would the truth of such sayings as these stand then: \"He that receiveth you receiveth me;\"[fn-27-P2775_1226943:21-nf] and \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\"?[fn-27-P2776_1227064:22-nf] Or is it possible for one not to be against Him, although he may be against His disciples? Nay; for what shall we make then of words like these: \"He that despiseth you, despiseth me;\"[fn-27-P2777_1227268:23-nf] and, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of mine, ye did it not unto me;\"[fn-27-P2778_1227365:24-nf] and, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me,\"[fn-27-P2779_1227429:25-nf] -although it was His disciples that Saul was persecuting? But, in good truth, the sense intended to be conveyed is just this, that, so far as a man is not with Him, so far is he against Him; and again, that, so far as a man is not against Him, so far is he with Him. For example, take this very case of the individual who was working miracles in the name of Christ, and yet was not in the company of Christ's disciples: so far as this man was working miracles in His name, so far was he with them, and so far he was not against them.[fn-27-P2780_1227980:26-nf] But, inasmuch as they had prohibited the man from doing a thing in which, so far forth, he was really with them, the Lord said to them,\" Forbid him not.\" For what they ought to have forbidden was what was outside their fellowship, so that they might bring him over to the unity of the Church, and not a thing like this, in which he was at one with them, that is to say, so far as he commended the name of their Master and Lord in the casting out of devils. And this is the principle on which the Catholic Church acts, not condemning common sacraments among heretics; for in these they are with us, and they are not against us. But she condemns and forbids division and separation, or any sentiment adverse to peace and truth. For therein they are against us, just because they are not with us in that, and because, not gathering with us, they are consequently scattering.

For instance, supposing the case of several rhetoricians, their pursuit, being one, has the same name in the numerous cases: but each of those who follow it works by himself, this one pleading on his own account, and that on his own account. Thus, since among men the action of each in the same pursuits is discriminated, they are properly called many, since each of them is separated from the others within his own environment, according to the special character of his operation. But in the case of the Divine nature we do not similarly learn that the Father does anything by Himself in which the Son does not work conjointly, or again that the Son has any special operation apart from the Holy Spirit; but every operation which extends from God to the Creation, and is named according to our variable conceptions of it, has its origin from the Father, and proceeds through the Son, and is perfected in the Holy Spirit. For this reason the name derived from the operation is not divided with regard to the number of those who fulfil it, because the action of each concerning anything is not separate and peculiar, but whatever comes to pass, in reference either to the acts of His providence for us, or to the government and constitution of the universe, comes to pass by the action of the Three, yet what does come to pass is not three things. We may understand the meaning of this from one single instance. From Him, I say, Who is the chief source of gifts, all things which have shared in this grace have obtained their life. When we inquire, then, whence this good gift came to us, we find by the guidance of the Scriptures that it was from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Yet although we set forth Three Persons and three names, we do not consider that we have had bestowed upon us three lives, one from each Person separately; but the same life is wrought in us by the Father, and prepared by the Son, and depends on the will of the Holy Spirit. Since then the Holy Trinity fulfils every operation in a mannersimilar to that of which I have spoken, not by separate action according to the number of the Persons, but so that there is one motion and disposition of the good will which is communicated from the Father through the Son to the Spirit (for as we do not call those whose operation gives one life three Givers of life, neither do we call those who are contemplated in one goodness three Good beings, nor speak of them in the plural by any of their other attributes); so neither can we call those who exercise this Divine and superintending power and operation towards ourselves and all creation, conjointly and inseparably, by their mutual action, three Gods. For as when we learn concerning the God of the universe, from the words of Scripture, that He judges all the earth[fn-25-P2585_1773701:15-nf] , we say that He is the Judge of all things through the Son: and again, when we hear that the Father judgeth no man[fn-25-P2586_1773835:16-nf] , we do not think that the Scripture is at variance with itself,-(for He Who judges all the earth does this by His Son to Whom He has committed all judgment; and everything which is done by the Only-begotten has its reference to the Father, so that He Himself is at once the Judge of all things and judges no man, by reason of His having, as we said, committed all judgment to the Son, while all the judgment of the Son is conformable to the will of the Father; and one could not properly say either that They are two judges, or that one of Them is excluded from the authority and power implied in judgment);-so also in the case of the word \"Godhead,\" Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God, and that very power of superintendence and beholding which we call Godhead, the Father exercises through the Only-begotten, while the Son perfects every power by the Holy Spirit, judging, as Isaiah says, by the Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning[fn-25-P2587_1774812:17-nf] , and acting by Him also, according to the saying in the Gospel which was spoken to the Jews. For He says, \"If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils[fn-25-P2588_1774978:18-nf] \"; where He includes every form of doing good in a partial description, by reason of the unity of action: for the name derived from operation cannot be divided among many where the result of their mutual operation is one.","title":"On \"Not Three Gods\"","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":12,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_33_book_xx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"16.

It was when, in passing through a field, the disciples plucked the ears of corn because they were hungry. Your doctrine would lead you to call this murder. Your mind is an altar, not of God, but of lying devils, by whose doctrines the evil conscience is seared as with a hot iron,[fn-19-P1946_1124733:9-nf] calling murder what the truth calls innocence. For in His words to the Jews, Christ by anticipation deals a fatal blow to you: \"If ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.\"[fn-19-P1947_1124993:10-nf] ","title":"Book XX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_34_book_iii","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"50. The fifth rule Tichonius lays down is one he designates of times,-a rule by which we can frequently discover or conjecture quantities of time which are not expressly mentioned in Scripture. And he says that this rule applies in two ways: either to the figure of speech called synecdoche, or to legitimate numbers. The figure synecdoche either puts the part for the whole, or the whole for the part. As, for example, in reference to the time when, in the presence of only three of His disciples, our Lord was transfigured on the mount, so that His face shone as the sun, and His raiment was white as snow, one evangelist says that this event occurred \"after eight days,\"[fn-52-P5255_2789683:86-nf] while another says that it occurred \"after six days.\"[fn-52-P5256_2789755:87-nf] Now both of these statements about the number of days cannot be true, unless we suppose that the writer who says \"after eight days,\" counted the latter part of the day on which Christ uttered the prediction and the first part of the day on which he showed its fulfillment as two whole days; while the writer who says \"after six days,\" counted only the whole unbroken days between these two. This figure of speech, which puts the part for the whole, explains also the great question about the resurrection of Christ. For unless to the latter part of the day on which He suffered we join the previous night, and count it as a whole day, and to the latter part of the night in which He arose we join the Lord's day and He would be in the heart of the earth.[fn-52-P5257_2790542:88-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":50,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_26_hymn_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"How shall I call Thee a stranger to us, Who art from us?

For what a ship is to the land, that our present life is to that which is immortal. And the storm and the tempests which beat against us are the temptations of this life, which in the world, as in a tempestuous sea, do not permit us to have a fair voyage free from pain, in a calm sea, and one which is free from evils.

There are, indeed, some men who have a good delivery, but cannot compose anything to deliver. Now, if such men take what has been written with wisdom and eloquence by others, and commit it to memory, and deliver it to the people, they cannot be blamed, supposing them to do it without deception For in this way many become preachers of the truth (which is certainly desirable), and yet not many teachers; for all deliver the discourse which one real teacher has composed, and there are no divisions among them. Nor are such men to be alarmed by the words of Jeremiah the prophet, through whom God denounces those who steal His words every one from his neighbor.[fn-54-P5493_2912325:85-nf] For those who steal take what does not belong to them, but the word of God belongs to all who obey it; and it is the man who speaks well, but lives badly, who really takes the words that belong to another, For the good things he says seem to be the result of his own thought, and yet they have nothing in common with his manner of life. And so God has said that they steal His words who would appear good by speaking God's words, but are in fact bad, as they follow their own ways. And if you look closely into the matter, it is not really themselves who say the good things they say. For how can they say in words what they deny in deeds? It is not for nothing that the apostle says of such men: \"They profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him.\"[fn-54-P5494_2913107:86-nf] In one sense, then, they do say the things, and in another sense they do not say them; for both these statements must be true, both being made by Him who is the Truth. Speaking of such men, in one place He says, \"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works;\"-that is to say, what ye hear from. their lips, that do; what ye see in their lives, that do ye not;-\"for they say and do not.\"[fn-54-P5495_2913552:87-nf] And so, though they do not, yet they say. but in another place, upbraiding such men, He says, \"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?\"[fn-54-P5496_2913736:88-nf] And from this it would appear that even what they say, when they say what is good, it is not themselves who say, for in will and in deed they deny what they say. Hence it happens that a wicked man who is eloquent may compose a discourse in which the truth is set forth to be delivered by a good man who is not eloquent; and when this takes place, the former draws from himself what does not belong to him, and the latter receives from another what really belongs to himself. But when true believers render this service to true believers, both parties speak what is their own, for God is theirs, to whom belongs all that they say; and even those who could not compose what they say make it their own by composing their lives in harmony with it.","title":"Book IV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_124_the_seventh_council_of_carthage_under_cyprian_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Secundinus of Cedias[fn-94-P9451_2945537:33-nf] said: Since our Lord Christ says, \"He who is not with me is against me; \"[fn-94-P9452_2945660:34-nf] and John the apostle calls those who depart from the Church Antichrists-undoubtedly enemies of Christ-any such as are called Antichrists cannot minister the grace of saving baptism.

It is waste of time to observe Faustus' remark, that Abraham falsely called Sara his sister; as if Faustus had discovered the family of Sara, though it is not mentioned in Scripture. In a matter which Abraham knew, and we do not, it is surely better to believe the patriarch when he says what he knows, than to believe Manichaeus when he finds fault with what he knows nothing about. Since, then, Abraham lived at that period in human history, when, though marriage had become unlawful between children of the same parents, or of the same father or mother, no law or authority interfered with the custom of marriage between the children of brothers, or any less degree of consanguinity, why should he not have had as wife his sister, that is, a woman descended from his father? For he himself told the king, when he restored Sara, that she was his sister by his father, and not by his mother. And on this occasion he could not have been led to tell a falsehood from fear, for the king knew that she was his wife, and was restoring her with honor, because he had been warned by God. We learn from Scripture that, among the ancients, it was customary to call cousins brothers and sisters. Thus Tobias says in his prayer to God, before having intercourse with his wife, \"And now, O Lord, Thou knowest that not in wantonness I take to wife my sister;\"[fn-21-P2112_1258965:59-nf] though she was not sprung immediately from the same father or the same mother, but only belonged to the same family.

This grace we obtain not from the synagogue, which is the mother of Christ after the flesh, but from God the Father.

(c) \"And\" immediately \"his chains fell off from his hands.\" (b) How? answer me: where are the heretics?-let them answer. \"And the Angel said unto him,\" etc. (v. 8) by this also convincing him that it is no fancy: to this end he bids him gird himself and put on his shoes, that he may shake off his sleep, and know that it is real. (a) (e) \"And he wist not that it was true that was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision\" (v. 9): (e) well he might, by reason of the excessive greatness (uperbolhn) of the things taking place. Do you mark what a thing it is for a miracle to be excessive (ekplhttei shmeiou)? how it amazes (ekplhttei) the beholder? how it will not let the thing be believed?[fn-10-P1096_1041330:14-nf] For if Peter \"thought he saw a vision,\" though he had girded himself and put on his shoes, what would have been the case with another? \"And,\" it says, \"when they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate, which opened unto them of its own accord\" (v. 10): and yet the things that had happened within (the prison) were more marvellous: but this was now more after the manner of man. \"And having gone out, they went along one street and immediately (all `until') the Angel departed from him.\" (v. 11.) When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along (prohlqen), there being so many hindrances. \"And when he came to himself:\" for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement (ekplhcij). \"Now,\" saith he, \"I know\"-now, not then, when I was in the prison,-\"that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And when he had considered\" (v. 12), it says: viz. where he was, or, that he must not without more ado depart but requite his Benefactor: \"he came to the house of Mary the mother of John.\" Who is this John? Probably[fn-10-P1097_1042582:15-nf] he that was always with them: for this is why he adds his distinctive name (to parashmon), \"whose surname was Mark.\" But observe, \"praying\" in the night, how much they got by it: what a good thing affliction is; how wakeful it made them! Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves,[fn-10-P1098_1043369:16-nf] without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs. And mark how the very servant-girls were henceforth upon an equality with them. \"For joy,\" it says, \"she opened not.\" (v. 13, 14.) This too is well done, that they likewise may not be amazed by seeing him at once, and that they may be incredulous, and their minds may be exercised. \"But ran in,\" etc. just as we are wont to do, she was eager to be herself the bringer of the good tidings, for good news it was indeed. \"And they said unto her, Thou art mad: but she constantly affirmed that it was even so: then said they, It is his Angel.\" (v. 15.) This is a truth, that each man has an Angel.[fn-10-P1099_1044431:17-nf] And what would the Angel?[fn-11-P1100_1045326:18-nf] It was from the time (of night) that they surmised this. But when he \"continued knocking, and when they had opened, and saw him, they were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand\" (v. 16, 17), made them keep quiet, to hear all that had happened to him. He was now an object of more affectionate desire to the disciples, not only in consequence of his being saved, but by his sudden coming in upon them and straightway departing. Now, both his friends learn all clearly; and the aliens also learn, if they had a mind, but they had not. The same thing happened in the case of Christ. \"Tell these things,\" he says, \"to James, and to the brethren.\" How free from all vainglory! Nor did he say, Make known these things to people everywhere, but, \"to the brethren. And he withdrew to another place:\" for he did not tempt God, nor fling himself into temptation: since, when they were commanded to do this, then they did it. \"Go,\" it was said, \"speak in the temple to the people.\" (ch. v. 20.) But this the Angel said not (here); on the contrary, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him free permission to withdraw-and this too is done, that we may learn that many things are providentially brought about after the manner of men-so that he should not again fall into peril.-For that they may not say, \"It was his Angel,\"[fn-11-P1101_1046838:19-nf] after he was gone, they say this first, and then they see himself overthrowing their notion of the matter.

When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along (prohlqen), there being so many hindrances. \"And when he came to himself:\" for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement (ekplhcij). \"Now,\" saith he, \"I know\"-now, not then, when I was in the prison,-\"that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves,[fn-10-P1098_1043369:16-nf] without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs.

But this the Angel said not (here); on the contrary, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him free permission to withdraw-and this too is done, that we may learn that many things are providentially brought about after the manner of men-so that he should not again fall into peril.-For that they may not say, \"It was his Angel,\"[fn-11-P1101_1046838:19-nf] after he was gone, they say this first, and then they see himself overthrowing their notion of the matter.

(a) And how was it he did not kill Peter immediately?

(And this) though he had numberless warnings in the case of both his grandfather and his father Herod, how the former in consequence of his putting the children to death suffered the greatest calamities, and the latter by slaying John raised up against himself a grievous war. But[fn-10-P1093_1037138:11-nf] as they thought * * He feared lest Peter, in consequence of the slaying of James, should withdraw; and wishing to have him in safe keeping, he put him in prison: \"and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers\" (v. 4): the stricter the custody, the more wondrous the display. \"Peter therefore was kept in prison.\" (v. 5.) But this was all the better for Peter, who was thereby made more approved, and evinced his own manly courage. And it says, \"there was earnest prayer making.\" It was the prayer of (filial) affection: it was for a father they asked, a father mild. \"There was,\" it says, \"earnest prayer.\" Hear how they were affected to their teachers. No factions, no perturbation:[fn-10-P1094_1038002:12-nf] but they betook them to prayer, to that alliance which is indeed invincible, to this they betook them for refuge. They did not say, \"What? I, poor insignificant creature that I am, to pray for him!\" for, as they acted of love, they did not give these things a thought. And observe, it was during the feast, that (their enemies) brought these trials upon them, that their worth might be the more approved. \"And when Herod,\" etc. (v. 6.)

I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":12,"verse":48,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But whenever a dispute arises about the nativity, all who reject it as creating a presumption in favour of the reality of Christ's flesh, wilfully deny that God Himself was born, on the ground that He asked, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"[fn-93-P9361_2572265:100-nf] Let, therefore, Apelles hear what was our answer to Marcion in that little work, in which we challenged his own (favourite) gospel to the proof, even that the material circumstances of that remark (of the Lord's) should be considered.[fn-93-P9362_2572541:101-nf] First of all, nobody would have told Him that His mother and brethren were standing outside, if he were not certain both that He had a mother and brethren, and that they were the very persons whom he was then announcing,-who had either been known to him before, or were then and there discovered by him; although heretics[fn-93-P9363_2572900:102-nf] have removed this passage from the gospel, because those who were admiring His doctrine said that His supposed father, Joseph the carpenter, and His mother Mary, and His brethren, and His sisters, were very well known to them. But it was with the view of tempting Him, that they had mentioned to Him a mother and brethren which He did not possess. The Scripture says nothing of this, although it is not in other instances silent when anything was done against Him by way of temptation. \"Behold,\" it says, \"a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him.\"[fn-93-P9364_2573482:103-nf] And in another passage: \"The Pharisees also came unto Him, tempting Him.\" Who[fn-93-P9365_2573579:104-nf] was to prevent its being in this place also indicated that this was done with the view of tempting Him? I do not admit what you advance of your own apart from Scripture. Then there ought to be suggested[fn-93-P9366_2573835:105-nf] some occasion[fn-93-P9367_2573865:106-nf] for the temptation. What could they have thought to be in Him which required temptation? The question, to be sure, whether He had been born or not? For if this point were denied in His answer, it might come out on the announcement of a temptation. And yet no temptation, when aiming at the discovery of the point which prompts the temptation by its doubtfulness, falls upon one so abruptly, as not to be preceded by the question which compels the temptation whilst raising the doubt.

When denying one's parents in indignation, one does not deny their existence, but censures their faults. Besides, He gave Others the preference; and since He shows their title to this favour-even because they listened to the word (of God)-He points out in what sense He denied His mother and His brethren.

Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the heathen used constantly to bandy about.[fn-95-P9507_2609313:222-nf] Was the Son of God reduced to such a depth of degradation Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our hope, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?[fn-95-P9508_2609551:223-nf] Such views are not improper for heathens and they are fit and natural for the heretics too.

In order, therefore, that He who was already the Son of God-of God the Father's seed, that is to say, the Spirit-might also be the Son of man, He only wanted to assume flesh, of the flesh of man[fn-95-P9544_2620178:250-nf] without the seed of a man;[fn-95-P9545_2620221:251-nf] for the seed of a man was unnecessary[fn-95-P9546_2620272:252-nf] for One who had the seed of God. As, then, before His birth of the virgin, He was able to have God for His Father without a human mother, so likewise, after He was born of the virgin, He was able to have a woman for His mother without a human father. He is thus man with God, in short, since He is man's flesh with God's Spirit[fn-95-P9547_2620616:253-nf] -flesh (I say) without seed from man, Spirit with seed from God. For as much, then, as the dispensation of God's purpose[fn-95-P9548_2620882:254-nf] concerning His Son required that He should be born[fn-95-P9549_2620961:255-nf] of a virgin, why should He not have received of the virgin the body which He bore from the virgin? Because, (forsooth) it is something else which He took from God, for \"the Word \"say they, \"was made flesh.\"[fn-95-P9550_2621188:256-nf] Now this very statement plainly shows what it was that was made flesh; nor can it possibly be that[fn-95-P9551_2621306:257-nf] anything else than the Word was made flesh. Now, whether it was of the flesh that the Word was made flesh, or whether it was so made of the (divine) seed itself, the Scripture must tell us. As, however, the Scripture is silent about everything except what it was that was made (flesh), and says nothing of that from which it was so made, it must be held to suggest that from something else, and not from itself, was the Word made flesh. And if not from itself, but from something else, from what can we more suitably suppose that the Word became flesh than from that flesh in which it submitted to the dispensation?[fn-95-P9552_2621953:258-nf] And (we have a proof of the same conclusion in the fact) that the Lord Himself sententiously and distinctly pronounced, \"that which is born of the flesh is flesh,\"[fn-95-P9553_2622163:259-nf] even because it is born of the flesh. But if He here spoke of a human being simply, and not of Himself, (as you maintain) then you must deny absolutely that Christ is man, and must maintain that human nature was not suitable to Him. And then He adds, \"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,\"[fn-95-P9554_2622480:260-nf] because God is a Spirit, and He was born of God. Now this description is certainly even more applicable to Him than it is to those who believe in Him. But if this passage indeed apply to Him, then why does not the preceding one also? For you cannot divide their relation, and adapt this to Him, and the previous clause to all other men, especially as you do not deny that Christ possesses the two substances, both of the flesh and of the Spirit. Besides, as He was in possession both of flesh and of Spirit, He cannot possibly, when speaking of the condition of the two substances which He Himself bears, be supposed to have determined that the Spirit indeed was His own, but that the flesh was not His own. Forasmuch, therefore, as He is of the Spirit He is God the Spirit, and is born of God; just as He is also born of the flesh of man, being generated in the flesh as man.[fn-95-P9555_2623377:261-nf] ","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"This, I believe, makes the greatness of the prophet Elias, and of him who afterwards appeared in the spirit and power of Elias, than whom \"of those that are born of women there was none greater[fn-26-P2698_1843919:33-nf] .\" If their history conveys any other mystic lesson, surely this above all is taught by their special mode of life, that the man whose thoughts are fixed upon the invisible is necessarily separated from all the ordinary events of life; his judgments as to the True Good cannot be confused and led astray by the deceits arising from the senses. Both, from their youth upwards, exiled themselves from human society, and in a way from human nature, in their neglect of the usual kinds of meat and drink, and their sojourn in the desert. The wants of each were satisfied by the nourishment that came in their way, so that their taste might remain simple and unspoilt, as their ears were free from any distracting noise, and their eyes from any wandering look. Thus they attained a cloudless calm of soul, and were raised to that height of Divine favour which Scripture records of each. Elias, for instance, became the dispenser of God's earthly gifts; he had authority to close at will the uses of the sky against the sinners and to open them to the penitent. John is not said indeed to have done any miracle; but the gift in him was pronounced by Him Who sees the secrets of a man greater than any prophet's. This was so, we may presume, because both, from beginning to end, so dedicated their hearts to the Lord that they were unsullied by any earthly passion; because the love of wife or child, or any other human call, did not intrude upon them, and they did not even think their daily sustenance worthy of anxious thought; because they showed themselves to be above any magnificence[fn-26-P2699_1845526:34-nf] of dress, and made shift with that which chance offered them, one clothing himself in goat-skins, the other with camel's hair. It is my belief that they would not have reached to this loftiness of spirit, if marriage had softened them. This is not simple history only; it is \"written for our admonition[fn-27-P2700_1845900:35-nf] ,\" that we might direct our lives by theirs. What, then, do we learn thereby? This: that the man who longs for union with God must, like those saints, detach his mind from all worldly business. It is impossible for the mind which is poured into many channels to win its way to the knowledge and the love of God.

What method of release from this jurisdiction can be devised? Here too the Gospel teaching is abundantly sufficient. We hear our Lord saying to Nicodemus, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit[fn-27-P2774_1887343:88-nf] .\" We know too that the flesh is subject to death because of sin, but the Spirit of God is both incorruptible, and life-giving, and deathless. As at our physical birth there comes into the world with us a potentiality of being again turned to dust, plainly the Spirit also imparts a life-giving potentiality to the children begotten by Himself. What lesson, then, results from these remarks? This: that we should wean ourselves from this life in the flesh, which has an inevitable follower, death; and that we should search for a manner of life which does not bring death in its train. Now the life of Virginity is such a life. We will add a few other things to show how true this is. Every one knows that the propagation of mortal frames is the work which the intercourse of the sexes has to do; whereas for those who are joined to the Spirit, life and immortality instead of children are produced by this latter intercourse; and the words of the Apostle beautifully suit their case, for the joyful mother of such children as these \"shall be saved in child-bearing[fn-27-P2775_1888430:89-nf] ;\" as the Psalmist in his divine songs thankfully cries, \"He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children[fn-27-P2776_1888588:90-nf] .\" Truly a joyful mother is the virgin mother who by the operation of the Spirit conceives the deathless children, and who is called by the Prophet barren because of her modesty only. This life, then, which is stronger than the power of death, is, to those who think, the preferable one. The physical bringing of children into the world-I speak without wishing to offend-is as much a starting-point of death as of life; because from the moment of birth the process of dying commences. But those who by virginity have desisted from this process have drawn within themselves the boundary line of death, and by their own deed have checked his advance; they have made themselves, in fact, a frontier between life and death, and a barrier too, which thwarts him. If, then, death cannot pass beyond virginity, but finds his power checked and shattered there, it is demonstrated that virginity is a stronger thing than death; and that body is rightly named undying which does not lend its service to a dying world, nor brook to become the instrument of a succession of dying creatures. In such a body the long unbroken career of decay and death, which has intervened between[fn-27-P2777_1889775:91-nf] the first man and the lives of virginity which have been led, is interrupted. It could not be indeed that death should cease working as long as the human race by marriage was working too; he walked the path of life with all preceding generations; he started with every new-born child and accompanied it to the end: but he found in virginity a barrier, to pass which was an impossible feat. Just as, in the age of Mary the mother of God, he who had reigned from Adam to her time found, when he came to her and dashed his forces against the fruit of her virginity as against a rock, that he was shattered to pieces upon her, so in every soul which passes through this life in the flesh under the protection of virginity, the strength of death is in a manner broken and annulled, for he does not find the places upon which he may fix his sting. If you do not throw into the fire wood, or straw, or grass, or something that it can consume, it has not the force to last by itself; so the power of death cannot go on working, if marriage does not supply it with material and prepare victims for this executioner. If you have any doubts left, consider the actual names of those afflictions which death brings upon mankind, and which were detailed in the first part of this discourse. Whence do they get their meaning? \"Widowhood,\" \"orphanhood,\" \"loss of children,\" could they be a subject for grief, if marriage did not precede? Nay, all the dearly-prized blisses, and transports, and comforts of marriage end in these agonies of grief, The hilt of a sword is smooth and handy, and polished and glittering outside; it seems to grow to the outline of the hand[fn-27-P2778_1891533:92-nf] ; but the other part is steel and the instrument of death, formidable to look at, more formidable still to come across. Such a thing is marriage. It offers for the grasp of the senses a smooth surface of delights, like a hilt of rare polish and beautiful workmanship; but when a man has taken it up and has got it into his hands, he finds the pain that has been wedded to it is in his hands as well; and it becomes to him the worker of mourning and of loss. It is marriage that has the heartrending spectacles to show of children left desolate in the tenderness of their years, a mere prey to the powerful, yet smiling often at their misfortune from ignorance of coming woes. What is the cause of widowhood but marriage? And retirement from this would bring with it an immunity from the whole burden of these sad taxes on our hearts. Can we expect it otherwise? When the verdict that was pronounced on the delinquents in the beginning is annulled, then too the mothers' \"sorrows[fn-27-P2779_1892575:93-nf] \" are no longer \"multiplied,\" nor does \"sorrow\" herald the births of men; then all calamity has been removed from life and \"tears wiped from off all faces[fn-27-P2780_1892748:94-nf] ;\" conception is no more an iniquity, nor child-bearing a sin; and births shall be no more \"of bloods,\" or \"of the will of man,\" or \"of the will of the flesh[fn-27-P2781_1892922:95-nf] \", but of God alone. This is always happening whenever any one in a lively heart conceives all the integrity of the Spirit, and brings forth wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption too. It is possible for any one to be the mother of such a son; as our Lord says, \"He that doeth my will is my brother, my sister, and my mother[fn-27-P2782_1893288:96-nf] .\" What room is there for death in such parturitions? Indeed in them death is swallowed up by life. In fact, the Life of Virginity seems to be an actual representation of the blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many signs of the presence of those expected blessings which are reserved for us there. That the truth of this statement may be perceived, we will verify it thus. It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once for all to sin lives for the future to God; he brings forth no more fruit unto death; and having so far as in him lies made an end[fn-27-P2783_1893900:97-nf] of this life within him according to the flesh, he awaits thenceforth the expected blessing of the manifestation[fn-27-P2784_1894069:98-nf] of the great God, refraining from putting any distance between himself and this coming of God by an intervening posterity: secondly, because he enjoys even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed results of our resurrection. For our Lord has announced that the life after our resurrection shall be as that of the angels. Now the peculiarity of the angelic nature is that they are strangers to marriage; therefore the blessing of this promise has been already received by him who has not only mingled his own glory with the halo of the Saints, but also by the stainlessness of his life has so imitated the purity of these incorporeal beings. If virginity then can win us favours such as these, what words are fit to express the admiration of so great a grace? What other gift of the soul can be found so great and precious as not to suffer by comparison with this perfection?","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":12,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"All things were made through Him.\" The \"through[fn-64-P6459_1076059:20-nf] whom \"is never found in the first place but always in the second, as in the Epistle to the Romans,[fn-64-P6460_1076192:21-nf] \"Paul a servant of Christ Jesus, a called Apostle, separated to the Gospel of God which He promised before by His prophets in Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, deter mined the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of the faith among all the nations, for His name's sake.\" For God promised aforehand by the prophets His own Gospel, the prophets being His ministers, and having their word to speak about Him \"through whom.\" And again God gave grace and apostleship to Paul and to the others for the obedience of the faith among all the nations, and this He gave them through Jesus Christ the Saviour, for the \"through whom\" belonged to Him. And the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-64-P6461_1077104:22-nf] \"At the end of the days He spoke to us in His Son, whom He made the heir of all things, 'through whom' also He made the ages,\" showing us that God made the ages through His Son, the\" through whom\" belonging, when the ages were being made, to the Only-begotten. Thus, if all things were made, as in this passage also, through the Logos, then they were not made by the Logos, but by a stronger and greater than He. And who else could this be but the Father? Now if, as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we have to enquire if the Holy Spirit also was made through Him. it appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who also admit that \"all things were made through Him,\" must necessarily assume that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being older than He. And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to have been made through Christ must, if he admits the truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be uncreated. There is a third resource besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the Father and the Son. But on further thought one may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the Spirit and the Son in the passage,[fn-64-P6462_1078585:23-nf] \"Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man. it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come.\" We consider, therefore, that there are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; and at the same thee we believe nothing to be uncreated but the Father. We therefore, as the more pious and the truer course, admit that all things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the most excellent and the first in order[fn-64-P6463_1079161:24-nf] of all that was made by the Father through Christ. And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not said to be God's own Son. The Only-begotten only is by nature and from the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have need of the Son, to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him not only to exist, but to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that we must think of Him as being. All this He has by participation of the character of Christ, of which we have spoken above. And I consider that the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through participation in Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts, which come from God; so that the said material of the gifts is made powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence in men to the Holy Spirit. I am led to this view of the charisms by the words of Paul which he writes somewhere,[fn-64-P6464_1080100:25-nf] \"There are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, and diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God that worketh all in all.\" The statement that all things were made by Him, and its seeming corollary, that the Spirit must have been called into being by the Word, may certainly raise some difficulty. There are some passages in which the Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but also by the Holy Spirit. \"Now the Lord hath sent Me,\" He says,[fn-64-P6465_1080706:26-nf] \"and His Spirit.\" and in the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come. What is the reason of this? Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven? May it not rather be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of their sins, while only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it, and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite of such great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them. When we find the Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the Saviour, but that the Saviour takes a lower place than He in order to carry out the plan which has been made that the Son of God should become man. Should any one stumble at our saying that the Saviour in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews,[fn-64-P6466_1081998:27-nf] where Jesus is shown by Paul to have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of death. \"We behold Him,\" he says, \"who hath been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.\" And this, too, has doubtless to be added, that the creation, in order to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and not least of all the human race, required the introduction into human nature of a happy and divine power, which should set right what was wrong upon the earth, and that this action fell to the share, as it were, of the Holy Spirit; but the Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts forward the Saviour as the only one able to endure such a conflict. The Father therefore, the principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before, promising to descend, when the thee comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him for the salvation of men. This He did. when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after the baptism. He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have done with men not able continuously to bear His glory. Thus John, when explaining how he knew who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining upon him. For it is written that John said:[fn-64-P6467_1083348:28-nf] \"He who sent me to baptize said, On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\" It is not said only, \"On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending,\" for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but \"descending and abiding on Him.\" Our examination of this point has been somewhat extended, since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things were made by Him, then the Spirit also was made through the Word, and is seen to be one of the \"all things\" which are inferior to their Maker. This view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words which may be adduced to the opposite effect. If any one should lend credence to the Gospel according to the Hebrews, where the Saviour Himself says, \"My mother, the Holy Spirit took me just now by one of my hairs and carried me off to the great mount Tabor,\" he will have to face the difficulty of explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother of Christ when it was itself brought into existence through the Word. But neither the passage nor this difficulty is hard to explain. For if he who does the will of the Father in heaven[fn-64-P6468_1084554:29-nf] is Christ's brother and sister and mother, and if the name of brother of Christ may be applied, not only to the race of men, but to beings of diviner rank than they, then there is nothing absurd in the Holy Spirit's being His mother, every one being His mother who does the will of the Father in heaven.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":12,"verse":50,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"All things were made through Him.\" The \"through[fn-64-P6459_1076059:20-nf] whom \"is never found in the first place but always in the second, as in the Epistle to the Romans,[fn-64-P6460_1076192:21-nf] \"Paul a servant of Christ Jesus, a called Apostle, separated to the Gospel of God which He promised before by His prophets in Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, deter mined the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of the faith among all the nations, for His name's sake.\" For God promised aforehand by the prophets His own Gospel, the prophets being His ministers, and having their word to speak about Him \"through whom.\" And again God gave grace and apostleship to Paul and to the others for the obedience of the faith among all the nations, and this He gave them through Jesus Christ the Saviour, for the \"through whom\" belonged to Him.

It is true that it is not my opinion about him that you have asked for, but that of the holy martyr Pamphilus; and you have requested to have the book which he is said to have written in his defence in Greek translated for you into Latin: nevertheless I do not doubt that there will be some who will think themselves aggrieved if I say anything in his defence even in the words of another man.

When we speak of the resurrection of the flesh, we do so, not with any subterfuges, as is slanderously reported by certain perons; we believe that it is this very flesh in which we are now living which will rise again, not one kind of flesh instead of another, nor another body than the body of this flesh. When we speak of the body rising we do so in the words of the apostle; for he himself made use of this word: and when we speak of the flesh, our confession is that of the Creed. It is an absurd invention of maliciousness to think that the human body is different from the flesh. However, whether we speak of that which is to rise, according to the common faith, as the flesh, or, according to the Apostle, as the body, this we must believe, that according to the clear statement of the Apostle, that which shall rise shall rise in power and in glory; it will rise an incorruptible and a spiritual body: for \"corruption cannot inherit incorruption.\" We must maintain this preëminence of the body, or flesh, which is to be: but, with this proviso, we must hold that the resurrection of the flesh is perfect and entire; we must on the one hand maintain the identity of the flesh, while on the other we must not detract from the dignity and glory of the incorruptible and spiritual body. For so the Scripture speaks. This is what is preached by the reverend Bishop John at Jerusalem; this we with him both confess and hold. If any one either believes or teaches otherwise, or insinuates that we believe differently from the exposition of our faith, let him be anathema. Let this then be taken as a record of our belief by any who desire to know it. Whatever we read and whatever we do is in accordance with this account of our faith; we follow the words of the Apostle,[fn-84-P8449_2069751:5-nf] \"proving all things holding fast that which is good, avoiding every form of evil.\"[fn-84-P8450_2069857:6-nf] \"And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and upon the Israel of God.\"","title":"Translation of Pamphilus' Defence of Origen.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":12,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_37_book_ii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The Manicheans say that the good God is not the Creator of all natures; the Pelagians that God is not the Purifier, the Saviour, the Deliverer of all ages among men.

They again recall us, however, to the words of Scripture, by bringing forward that celebrated question of theirs, affirming that it is written, \"A bad tree cannot produce good fruits; for a tree is known by its fruit.\"[fn-65-P6565_1307426:65-nf] What, then, is their position? What sort of tree the law is, is shown by its fruits, i.e., by the language of its precepts. For if the law be found to be good, then undoubtedly He who gave it is believed to be a good God. But if it be just rather than good, then God also will be considered a just legislator. The Apostle Paul makes use of no circumlocution, when he says, \"The law is good; and the commandment is holy, and just, and good.\"[fn-65-P6566_1307900:66-nf] From which it is clear that Paul had not learned the language of those who separate justice from goodness, but had been instructed by that God, and illuminated by His Spirit, who is at the same time both holy, and good, and just; and speaking by whose Spirit he declared that the commandment of the law was holy, and just, and good. And that he might show more clearly that goodness was in the commandment to a greater degree than justice and holiness, repeating his words, he used, instead of these three epithets, that of goodness alone, saying, \"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid.\"[fn-65-P6567_1308529:67-nf] As he knew that goodness was the genus of the virtues, and that justice and holiness were species belonging to the genus, and having in the former verses named genus and species together, he fell back, when repeating his words, on the genus alone. But in those which follow he says, \"Sin wrought death in me by that which is good,\"[fn-65-P6568_1308880:68-nf] where he sums up generically what he had beforehand explained specifically. And in this way also is to be understood the declaration, \"A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things.\"[fn-65-P6569_1309185:69-nf] For here also he assumed that there was a genus in good or evil, pointing out unquestionably that in a good man there were both justice, and temperance, and prudence, and piety, and everything that can be either called or understood to be good. In like manner also he said that a man was wicked who should without any doubt be unjust, and impure, and unholy, and everything which singly makes a bad man. For as no one considers a man to be wicked without these marks of wickedness (nor indeed can he be so), so also it is certain that without these virtues no one will be deemed to be good. There still remains to them, however, that saying of the Lord in the Gospel, which they think is given them in a special manner as a shield, viz., \"There is none good but one, God the Father.\"[fn-65-P6570_1309989:70-nf] This word they declare is peculiar to the Father of Christ, who, however, is different from the God who is Creator of all things, to which Creator he gave no appellation of goodness. Let us see now if, in the Old Testament, the God of the prophets and the Creator and Legislator of the word is not called good. What are the expressions which occur in the Psalms? \"How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart!\"[fn-65-P6571_1310427:71-nf] and, \"Let Israel now say that He is good, that His mercy endureth for ever; \"[fn-65-P6572_1310525:72-nf] the language in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, \"The Lord is good to them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him.\"[fn-65-P6573_1310667:73-nf] As therefore God is frequently called good in the Old Testament, so also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is styled just in the Gospels. Finally, in the Gospel according to John, our Lord Himself, when praying to the Father, says, \"O just Father, the world hath not known Thee.\"[fn-65-P6574_1310968:74-nf] And lest perhaps they should say that it was owing to His having assumed human flesh that He called the Creator of the world \"Father,\" and styled Him \"Just,\" they are excluded from such a refuge by the words that immediately follow, \"The world hath not known Thee.\" But, according to them, the world is ignorant of the good God alone. For the word unquestionably recognises its Creator, the Lord Himself saying that the world loveth what is its own. Clearly, then, He whom they consider to be the good God, is called just in the Gospels. Any one may at leisure gather together a greater number of proofs, consisting of those passages, where in the New Testament the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is called just, and in the Old also, where the Creator of heaven and earth is called good; so that the heretics, being convicted by numerous testimonies, may perhaps some time be put to the blush.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":12,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_37_book_i_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"1.

The holy apostle, wishing to teach us some great and hidden truth respecting science and wisdom, says, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians: \"We speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of the world, that come to nought: but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: which none of the princes of the world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-71-P7174_1587586:317-nf] In this passage, wishing to describe the different kinds of wisdom, he points out that there is a wisdom of this world, and a wisdom of the princes of this world, and another wisdom of God. But when he uses the expression \"wisdom of the princes of this world,\" I do not think that he means a wisdom common to all the princes of this world, but one rather that is peculiar to certain individuals among them. And again, when he says, \"We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory,\"[fn-71-P7175_1588160:318-nf] we must inquire whether his meaning be, that this is the same wisdom of God which was hidden from other times and generations, and was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets, and Which was also that wisdom of God before the advent of the Saviour, by means of which Solomon obtained his wisdom, and in reference to which the language of the Saviour Himself declared, that what He taught was greater than Solomon, in these words, \"Behold, a greater than Solomon is here,\"[fn-71-P7176_1588709:319-nf] -words which show, that those who were instructed by the Saviour were instructed in something higher than the knowledge of Solomon. For if one were to assert that the Saviour did indeed Himself possess greater knowledge, but did not communicate more to others than Solomon did, how will that agree with the statement which follows: \"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment, and condemn the men of this generation, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here? \"There is therefore a wisdom of this world, and also probably a wisdom belonging to each individual prince of this world.

Sixthly, let it be asserted that it is written, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.[fn-45-P4530_1426571:39-nf] The solution of this is as follows:-Can and Cannot are not words with only one meaning, but have many meanings. On the one hand they are used sometimes in respect of deficiency of strength, sometimes in respect of time, and sometimes relatively to a certain object; as for instance, A Child cannot be an Athlete, or, A Puppy cannot see, or fight with so and so. Perhaps some day the child will be an athlete, the puppy will see, will fight with that other, though it may still be unable to fight with Any other. Or again, they may be used of that which is Generally true. For instance,-A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid;[fn-45-P4531_1427218:40-nf] while yet it might possibly be hidden by another higher hill being in a line with it. Or in another sense they are used of a thing which is not reasonable; as, Can the Children of the Bridechamber fast while the Bridegroom is with them;[fn-45-P4532_1427473:41-nf] whether He be considered as visible in bodily form (for the time of His sojourning among us was not one of mourning, but of gladness), or, as the Word. For why should they keep a bodily fast who are cleansed by the Word?[fn-45-P4533_1427713:42-nf] Or, again, they are used of that which is contrary to the will; as in, He could do no mighty works there because of their unbelief,[fn-45-P4534_1427862:43-nf] -i.e. of those who should receive them. For since in order to healing there is need of both faith in the patient and power in the Healer,[fn-45-P4535_1428018:44-nf] when one of the two failed the other was impossible. But probably this sense also is to be referred to the head of the unreasonable. For healing is not reasonable in the case of those who would afterwards be injured by unbelief. The sentence The world cannot hate you,[fn-45-P4536_1428427:45-nf] comes under the same head, as does also How can ye, being evil, speak good things?[fn-45-P4537_1428528:46-nf] For in what sense is either impossible, except that it is contrary to the will? There is a somewhat similar meaning in the expressions which imply that a thing impossible by nature is possible to God if He so wills;[fn-45-P4538_1428764:47-nf] as that a man cannot be born a second time,[fn-45-P4539_1428828:48-nf] or that a needle will not let a camel through it.[fn-45-P4540_1428896:49-nf] For what could prevent either of these things happening, if God so willed?","title":"Oration XXX.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":12,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_45_oration_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XIII. The eighth passage is, That they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent;[fn-45-P4560_1435250:66-nf] and There is none good save one, that is, God.[fn-45-P4561_1435315:67-nf] The solution of this appears to me very easy. For if you attribute this only to the Father, where will you place the Very Truth? For if you conceive in this manner of the meaning of To the only wise God,[fn-45-P4562_1435540:68-nf] or Who only hath Immortality, Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto,[fn-45-P4563_1435643:69-nf] or of to the king of the Ages, immortal, invisible, and only wise God,[fn-45-P4564_1435731:70-nf] then the Son has vanished under sentence of death, or of darkness, or at any rate condemned to be neither wise nor king, nor invisible, nor God at all, which sums up all these points. And how will you prevent His Goodness, which especially belongs to God alone, from perishing with the rest? I, however, think that the passage That they may know Thee the only true God, was said to overthrow those gods which are falsely so called, for He would not have added and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent, if The Only True God were contrasted with Him, and the sentence did not proceed upon the basis of a common Godhead. The \"None is Good\" meets the tempting Lawyer, who was testifying to His Goodness viewed as Man. For perfect goodness, He says, is God's alone, even if a man is called perfectly good. As for instance, A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.[fn-45-P4565_1436638:71-nf] And, I will give the kingdom to one who is good above Thee.[fn-45-P4566_1436717:72-nf] ...

Or again, Do good, O Lord, unto the good[fn-45-P4567_1436826:73-nf] ... and all other like expressions concerning those of us who are praised, upon whom it is a kind of effluence from the Supreme Good, and has come to them in a secondary degree. It will be best of all if we can persuade you of this. But if not, what will you say to the suggestion on the other side, that on your hypothesis the Son has been called the only God. In what passage? Why, in this:-This is your God; no other shall be accounted of in comparison with Him, and a little further on, after this did He shew Himself upon earth, and conversed with men.[fn-45-P4568_1437402:74-nf] This addition proves clearly that the words are not used of the Father, but of the Son; for it was He Who in bodily form companied with us, and was in this lower world. Now, if we should determine to take these words as said in contrast with the Father, and not with the imaginary gods, we lose the Father by the very terms which we were pressing against the Son.

For, in the next place, that I may not seem to rest on mere human arguments,-since there is so much obscurity in this question, that in earlier ages of the Church, before the schism of Donatus, it has caused men of great weight, and even our fathers, the bishops, whose hearts were full of charity, so to dispute and doubt among themselves, saving always the peace of the Church, that the several statutes of their Councils in their different districts long varied from each other, till at length the most wholesome opinion was established, to the removal of all doubts, by a plenary Council of the whole world:[fn-30-P3066_1800944:15-nf] -I therefore bring forward from the gospel clear proofs, by which I propose, with God's help, to prove how rightly and truly in the sight of God it has been determined, that in the case of every schismatic and heretic, the wound which caused his separation should be cured by the medicine of the Church; but that what remained sound in him should rather be recognized with approbation, than wounded I by condemnation. It is indeed true that the Lord says in the gospel, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"[fn-30-P3067_1801535:16-nf] Yet when the disciples had brought word to Him that they had seen one casting out devils in His name, and had forbidden him, because he followed not them, He said, \"Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. For there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.\"[fn-30-P3068_1801870:17-nf] If, indeed, there were nothing in this man requiring correction, then any one would be safe who, setting himself outside the communion of the Church, severing himself from all Christian brotherhood, should gather in Christ's name; and so there would be no truth in this, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\" But if he required correction in the point where the disciples in their ignorance were anxious to check him, why did our Lord, by saying, \"Forbid him not,\" prevent this check from being given? And how can that be true which He then says, \"He that is not against you is for you?\" For in this point he was not against, but for them, when he was working miracles of healing in Christ's name. That both, therefore, should be true, as both are true,-both the declaration, that \"he that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad;\" and also the injunction, \"Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is for you,\"-what must we understand, except that the man was to be confirmed in his veneration for that mighty Name, in respect of which he was not against the Church, but for it; and yet he was to be bland for separating himself from the Church, whereby his gathering became a scattering; and if it should have so happened that he sought union with the Church, he should not have received what he already possessed, but be made to set right the points wherein he had gone astray?","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":36,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We who carry about our very soul, our very body, exposed in this world[fn-122-P12297_3439645:81-nf] to injury from all, and exhibit patience under that injury; shall we be hurt at the loss[fn-122-P12298_3439748:82-nf] of less important things?[fn-122-P12299_3439792:83-nf] Far from a servant of Christ be such a defilement as that the patience which has been prepared for greater temptations should forsake him in frivolous ones.

When, then, you have upset his enjoyment by not being pained, he must needs he pained by the loss of his enjoyment. Then you not only go unhurt away, which even alone is enough for you; but gratified, into the bargain, by your adversary's disappointment, and revenged by his pain.

We therefore charge the Jews with not acknowledging Him to be God, to whom testimony was borne in many passages by the prophets, to the effect that He was a mighty power, and a God next to[fn-80-P8053_1969517:28-nf] the God and Father of all things. For we assert that it was to Him the Father gave the command, when in the Mosaic account of the creation He uttered the words, \"Let there be light,\" and \"Let there be a firmament,\" and gave the injunctions with regard to those other creative acts which were performed; and that to Him also were addressed the words, \"Let Us make man in Our own image and likeness; \"and that the Logos, when commanded, obeyed all the Father's will. And we make these statements not from our own conjectures, but because we believe the prophecies circulated among the Jews, in which it is said of God, and of the works of creation, in express words, as follows: \"He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.\"[fn-80-P8054_1971146:29-nf] Now if God gave the command, and the creatures were formed, who, according to the view of the spirit of prophecy, could He be that was able to carry out such commands of the Father, save Him who, so to speak, is the living Logos and the Truth?

John the Baptist, when predicting that the Son of God was to appear immediately, not in that body and soul, but as manifesting Himself everywhere, says regarding Him: \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not, who cometh after me.\"[fn-80-P8056_1972020:31-nf] For if he had thought that the Son of God was only there, where was the visible body of Jesus, how could he have said, \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not? \"And Jesus Himself, in raising the minds of His disciples to higher thoughts of the Son of God, says: \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of you.\"[fn-80-P8057_1972401:32-nf] And of the same nature is His promise to His disciples: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8058_1972536:33-nf] And we quote these passages, making no distinction between the Son of God and Jesus. For the soul and body of Jesus formed, after the oi0konomi/a, one being with the Logos of God. Now if, according to Paul's teaching, \"he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit,\"[fn-80-P8059_1972826:34-nf] every one who understands what being joined to the Lord is, and who has been actually joined to Him, is one spirit with the Lord; how should not that being be one in a far greater and more divine degree, which was once united with the Logos of God?[fn-80-P8060_1973095:35-nf] He, indeed, manifested Himself among the Jews as the power of God, by the miracles which He performed, which Celsus suspected were accomplished by sorcery, but which by the Jews of that time were attributed I know not why, to Beelzebub, in the words \"He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.\"[fn-80-P8061_1973696:36-nf] But these our Saviour convicted of uttering the greatest absurdities, from the fact that the kingdom of evil was not yet come to an end.

To give then some illustrations for example's sake, the spirit of covetousness, and the spirit of luxuriousness, because the one heaps together, and the other lavishes, are divided against themselves; yet they belong both to the kingdom of the devil. Among idolaters the spirit of Juno and the spirit of Hercules, are divided against themselves; and both belongto the kingdom of the devil. The heathen Christ's enemy, and the Jew Christ's enemy, are divided against themselves; and both belong to the kingdom of the devil. Arianus and Photinianus both are heretics, and both are divided against themselves. The Donatist and Maximianist[fn-38-P3883_1677936:12-nf] both are heretics, and both divided against themselves. All men's vices and errors that are contrary to each other are divided against themselves, and all belong to the kingdom of the devil; therefore his kingdom shall not stand. But the righteous and the ungodly, the believer and the unbeliever, the Catholic and the heretic, are indeed divided against themselves, but they do not belong all to the kingdom of Christ. \"The Lord knoweth them that are His.\" Let no one flatter himself upon a mere name.

For who is not convicted of having spoken a word against the Holy Ghost, before he became a Christian or a Catholic? In the first place, are not they who are called Pagans, the worshippers of many and false gods, and the adorers of idols, forasmuch as they say that the Lord Christ wrought miracles by magical arts, are not they like these who said that He cast out devils through the prince of the devils? And again, when day by day they blaspheme our sanctification, what else blaspheme they but the Holy Ghost? What? Do not the Jews-they who spoke concerning our Lord what gave occasion to this very discourse-do they not even to the present day speak a word against the Holy Ghost, by denying that He is now in Christians, just as the others denied Him to be in Christ? For not even did they revile the Holy Ghost, by asserting either that He existed not, or that though He existed, yet that He was not God, but a creature; or that He had no power to cast out devils; they did not speak thus unworthily, or anything like it, of the Holy Ghost. For the Sadducees indeed denied the Holy Ghost; but the Pharisees maintained His existence against their heresy,[fn-38-P3886_1681516:14-nf] but they denied that He was in the Lord Jesus Christ, who they thought cast out devils through the prince of the devils, whereas He did cast them out through the Holy Ghost. And hence, both Jews and whatsoever heretics there are who confess the Holy Ghost, but deny that He is in the Body of Christ, which is His One Only Church, none other than the One Catholic Church, are without doubt like the Pharisees who at that time although they confessed the existence of the Holy Ghost, yet denied that He was in Christ, whose works in casting out devils they attributed to the prince of devils. I say nothing of the fact that some heretics either boldly maintain that the Holy Ghost is not the Creator but a creature, as the Arians, and Eunomians, and Macedonians, or so entirely deny His existence, as to deny that God is Trinity, but assert thatHe is God the Father only, and that He is sometimes called the Son, and sometimes the Holy Ghost; as the Sabellians, whom some call Patripassians, because they hold that the Father suffered; and forasmuch as they deny that He has any Son, without doubt they deny His Holy Spirit also. The Photinians again who say that the Father only is God, and the Son a mere man, deny altogether that there is any third Person of the Holy Ghost.","title":"Sermon XXI. [LXXI.

Wherefore, neither must we imagine, as some do, that the word which is spoken against the Son of Man is forgiven, but that which is spoken against the Holy Ghost is not forgiven, because Christ became the Son of Man by reason of His assuming flesh, in which respect the Holy Ghost of course is greater, who in His Own Substance is equal to the Father and the Only-begotten Son according to His Divinity, according to which also the Only-begotten Son Himself is equal to the Father and the Holy Spirit.

No surely: but after the universal mention of all sins and of all blasphemy, He wished to express more prominently the blasphemy which is spoken against the Son of Man for this reason, because although men should be even bound in that sin which He mentioned when He said,\" If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin:\"[fn-39-P3978_1718025:87-nf] which sin also in the Gospel according to John He shows to be a very grievous one, when He says of the Holy Spirit Himself, when He promised that He would send Him, \"He shall reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they believed not on Me:\"[fn-39-P3979_1718325:88-nf] yet if that hardness of the impenitent heart have not spoken a word against the Holy Ghost, even this which is spoken against the Son of Man shall be forgiven.","title":"Sermon XXI.

Now, therefore, the question is, how could men of the party of the devil belong to the Church, which has no spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,[fn-35-P3508_1984540:61-nf] of which also it is said, \"My dove is one?\"[fn-35-P3509_1984618:62-nf] But if they cannot, it is clear that she groans among those who are not of her, some treacherously laying wait within, some barking at her gate without. Such men, however, even within, both receive baptism, and possess it, and transmit it holy in itself; nor is it in any way defiled by their wickedness, in which they persevere even to the end. Wherefore the same blessed Cyprian teaches us that baptism is to be considered as consecrated in itself by the words of the gospel, as the Church has received, without joining to it or mingling with it any consideration of waywardness and wickedness on the part of either minister or recipients; since he himself points out to us both truths,-both that there have been some within the Church who did not cherish kindly Christian love, but practised envy and unkind dissension, of whom the Apostle Paul spoke; and also that the envious belong to the devil's party, as he testifies in the most open way in the epistle which he wrote about envy and malignity. Wherefore, since it is clearly possible that in those who belong to the devil's party, Christ's sacrament may yet be holy,-not, indeed, to their salvation, but to their condemnation,and that not only if they are led astray after they have been baptized, but even if they were such in heart when they received the sacrament, renouncing the world (as the same Cyprian shows) in words only and not in deeds;[fn-35-P3510_1986052:63-nf] and since even if afterwards they be brought into the right way, the sacrament is not to be again administered which they received when they were astray; so far as I can see, the case is already clear and evident, that in the question of baptism we have to consider, not who gives, but what he gives; not who receives, but what he receives not who has, but what he has. For if men of the party of the devil, and therefore in no way belonging to the one dove, can yet receive, and have, and give baptism in all its holiness, in no way defiled by their waywardness, as we are taught by the letters of Cyprian himself, how are we ascribing to heretics what does not belong to them? how are we saying that what is really Christ's is theirs, and not rather recognizing in them the signs of our Sovereign, and correcting the deeds of deserters from Him? Wherefore it is one thing, as the holy Cyprian says, \"for those within in the Church, to speak in the name of Christ another thing for those without, who are acting against the Church, to baptize in His name.\"[fn-35-P3511_1987132:64-nf] But both many who are within act against the Church by evil living, and by enticing weak souls to copy their lives; and some who are without speak in Christ's name, and are not forbidden to work the works of Christ, but only to be without, since for the healing of their souls we grasp at them, or reason with them, or exhort them. For he, too, was without who did not follow Christ with His disciples, and yet in Christ's name was casting out devils, which the Lord enjoined that he should not be prevented from doing;[fn-35-P3512_1987679:65-nf] although, certainly, in the point where he was imperfect he was to be made whole, in accordance with the words of the Lord, in which He says, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"[fn-35-P3513_1987936:66-nf] Therefore both some things are done outside in the name of Christ not against the Church, and some things are done inside on the devil's part which are against the Church.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_55_book_iv_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"25. \"Can the power of baptism,\" says Cyprian, \"be greater or better than confession? than martyrdom? that a man should confess Christ before men, and be baptized in his own blood?

And therefore, whatever men have that belongs to the Church, it profits them nothing towards salvation outside the Church. But it is one thing not to have, another to have so as to be of no use.

These things being so, all who destroy the form of the Gospel are vain, unlearned, and also audacious; those, [I mean, ] who represent the aspects of the Gospel as being either more in number than as aforesaid, or, on the other hand, fewer. The former class [do so], that they may seem to have discovered more than is of the truth; the latter, that they may set the dispensations of God aside. For Marcion, rejecting the entire Gospel, yea rather, cutting himself off from the Gospel, boasts that he has part in the [blessings of] the Gospel.[fn-75-P7519_2021367:154-nf] Others, again (the Montanists), that they may set at nought the gift of the Spirit, which in the latter times has been, by the good pleasure of the Father, poured out upon the human race, do not admit that aspect [of the evangelical dispensation] presented by John's Gospel, in which the Lord promised that He would send the Paraclete;[fn-75-P7520_2022029:155-nf] but set aside at once both the Gospel and the prophetic Spirit. Wretched men indeed! who wish to be pseudo-prophets, forsooth, but who set aside the gift of prophecy from the Church; acting like those (the Encratitae)[fn-75-P7521_2022273:156-nf] who, on account of such as come in hypocrisy, hold themselves aloof from the communion of the brethren.

For if what they have published is the Gospel of truth, and yet is totally unlike those which have been handed down to us from the apostles, any who please may learn, as is shown from the Scriptures themselves, that that which has been handed down from the apostles can no longer be reckoned the Gospel of truth. But that these Gospels alone are true and reliable, and admit neither an increase nor diminution of the aforesaid number, I have proved by so many and such [arguments]. For, since God made all things in due proportion and adaptation, it was fit also that the outward aspect of the Gospel should be well arranged and harmonized. The opinion of those men, therefore, who handed the Gospel down to us, having been investigated, from their very fountainheads, let us proceed also to the remaining apostles, and inquire into their doctrine with regard to God; then, in due course we shall listen to the very words of the Lord.","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":12,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"134","folder":"ANF-01","text":"6.

Ye hypocrites, how can ye being evil speak good things?[fn-41-P4129_1768533:6-nf] In the one place He says, \"How can ye being evil speak good things?'\" in the other He says, \"What they say, do, but do ye not after their works. For they say, and do not.\" If \"they say and do not,\" they are evil; if they are evil, they cannot \"speak good things;\" how then are we to do what we hear from them, when we cannot hear from them what is good? Now take heed, Holy and Beloved,[fn-41-P4130_1768942:7-nf] how this question may be solved. Whatever an evil man brings forth from himself, is evil; whatever an evil man brings forth out of his own heart, is evil; for there is the evil treasure. But whatever a good man brings forth out of his heart, is good; for there is the good treasure. Whence then did those evil men bring forth good things? \"Because they sat in Moses\" seat.\"[fn-41-P4131_1769337:8-nf] Had He not first said, \"They sit in Moses' seat;\" He would never have enjoined that evil men should be heard. For what they brought forth out of the evil treasure of theirown heart, was one thing; another what they gave utterance to out of the seat of Moses, the criers so to say of the judge. What the crier says, will never be attributed to him if he speak in the presence of the judge. What the crier says in his own house is one thing, what the crier says as hearing it from the judge is another. For whether he will or no, the crier must proclaim the sentence[fn-41-P4132_1769921:9-nf] of punishment even of his own friend. And so whether he will or no, must he proclaim the sentence of the acquittal even of his own enemy. Suppose him to speak from his heart; lie acquits his friend, and punishes his enemy. Suppose him to speak from the judge's chair; he punishes his friend, and acquits his enemy.

And with this the Lord has suffered you to be wounded that you may at least learn in your old age to sympathize with infirmities to which you are a stranger, and may know from your own case and experience how to condescend to the frailties of the young, though when you received a young man troubled by an attack from the devil, you did not encourage him with any consolation, but gave him up in dejection and destructive despair into the hands of the enemy, to be, as far as you were concerned, miserably destroyed by him. But the enemy would certainly never have attacked him with so fierce an onslaught, with which he has up till now scorned to attack you, unless in his jealousy at the progress he was to make, he had endeavoured to get the better of that virtue which he saw lay in his disposition, and to destroy it with his fiery darts, as he knew without the shadow of a doubt that he was the stronger, since he deemed t worth his while to attack him with such vehemence. And so learn from your own experience to sympathize with those in trouble, and never to terrify with destructive despair those who are in danger, nor harden them with severe speeches, but rather restore them with gentle and kindly consolations, and as the wise Solomon says, \"Spare not to deliver those who are led forth to death, and to redeem those who are to be slain,\"[fn-37-P3722_1395535:30-nf] and after the example of our Saviour, break not the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax,[fn-37-P3723_1395651:31-nf] and ask of the Lord that grace, by means of which you yourself may faithfully learn both in deed and power to sing: \"the Lord hath given me a learned tongue that I should know how to uphold by word him that is weary:\"[fn-37-P3724_1395896:32-nf] for no one could bear the devices of the enemy, or extinguish or repress those carnal fires which burn with a sort of natural flame, unless God's grace assisted our weakness, or protected and supported it. And therefore, as the reason for this salutary incident is over, by which the Lord meant to set that young man free from dangerous desires and to teach you something of the violence of their attack, and of the feeling of compassion, let us together implore Him in prayer, that He may be pleased to remove that scourge, which the Lord thought good to lay upon you for your good (for \"He maketh sorry and cureth: he striketh and his hands heal. He humbleth and exalteth, he killeth and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up\")[fn-37-P3725_1396663:33-nf] , and may extinguish with the abundant dew of His Spirit the fiery darts of the devil, which at my desire He allowed to wound you. And although the Lord removed this temptation at a single prayer of the old man with the same speed with which He had suffered it to come upon him, yet He showed by a clear proof that a man's faults when laid bare were not merely not to be scolded, but that the grief of one in trouble ought not to be lightly despised. And therefore never let the clumsiness or shallowness of one old man or of a few deter you and keep you back from that life-giving way, of which we spoke earlier, or from the tradition of the Elders, if our crafty enemy makes a wrongful use of their grey hairs in order to deceive younger men: but without any cloak of shame everything should be disclosed to the Elders, and remedies for wounds be faithfully received from them together with examples of life and conversation: from which we shall find like help and the same sort of result, if we try to do nothing at all on our own responsibility and judgment.","title":"II.

For as in the beginning he enticed man to transgress his Maker's law, and thereby got him into his power; yet his power consists in transgression and apostasy, and with these he bound man [to himself]; so again, on the other hand, it was necessary that through man himself he should, when conquered, be bound with the same chains with which he had bound man, in order that man, being set free, might return to his Lord, leaving to him (Satan) those bonds by which he himself had been fettered, that is, sin.

Daniel also says particularly, that the end of the fourth kingdom consists in the toes of the image seen by Nebuchadnezzar, upon which came the stone cut out without hands; and as he does himself say: \"The feet were indeed the one part iron, the other part clay, until the stone was cut out without hands, and struck the image upon the iron and clay feet, and dashed them into pieces, even to the end.\"[fn-92-P9265_2700904:230-nf] Then afterwards, when interpreting this, he says: \"And as thou sawest the feet and the toes, partly indeed of clay, and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided, and there shall be in it a root of iron, as thou sawest iron mixed with baked clay.

For sometimes days, and things, and men, and times are de- noted in holy Scripture in no other fashion. As in this case where God declares that Israel shall serve the Egyptians for four hundred years, and says to Abraham: \"Know thou that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall bring them under bondage and afflict them four hundred years.\"[fn-74-P7422_2723383:43-nf] Whereas if you take into account the whole time after that God spoke, they are more than four hundred: but if you only reckon the time in which they were in slavery, they are less. And in giving this period indeed, unless you understand it in this way, we must think that the Word of God lied (and away with such a thought from Christian minds!). But since from the time of the Divine utterance, the whole period of their lives amounted to more than four hundred years, and their bondage endured for not nearly four hundred, you must understand that the part is to be taken for the whole, or the whole for the part. There is also a similar way of representing days and nights, where, when in the case of either division of time one day is meant, either period is shown by a portion of a single period. And indeed in this way the difficulty about the time of ourLord's Passion is cleared up: for whereas the Lord prophesied that after the model of the prophet Jonah, the Son of man would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,[fn-74-P7423_2724451:44-nf] and whereas after the sixth day of the week on which He was crucified, He was only in hell[fn-74-P7424_2724561:45-nf] for one day and two nights, how can we show the truth of the Divine words? Surely by the trope of Synecdoche, i.e., because to the day on which He was crucified the previous night belongs, and to the night on which He rose again, the coming day; and so when there is added the night which preceded the day belonging to it, and the day which followed the night belonging to it, we see thatthere is nothing lacking to the whole period of time, which is made up of its portions. Theholy Scriptures abound in such instances of ways of speaking: but it would take too longto relate them all. For so when the Psalm says, \"What is a man that Thou art mindfulof Him,\"[fn-74-P7425_2725239:46-nf] from the hart we understand thewhole, as while only one man is mentioned the whole human race is meant. So also where Ahab sinned we are told that the people sinned. Where - though all are mentioned, a part is to be understood from the whole. John also the Lord's forerunner says: \"After me cometh a man who is preferred before me for He was before me.\"[fn-74-P7426_2725613:47-nf] How then does He mean that He would come after Him, whom He shows to be before Him? For if this is understood of a man who was afterwards born, how was he before him? But if it is taken of the Word how is it, \"a man cometh after me?\" Except that in the one Lord Jesus Christ is shown both the posteriority of the manhood and the precedence of the Godhead. And so the result is that one and the same Lord was before him and came after him: for according to the flesh He was posterior in time to John; and according to His Deity was before all men. And so he, when he named that man, denoted both the manhood and the Word, for as the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God was complete in both manhood and Divinity[fn-74-P7427_2726332:48-nf] in mentioning one of these natures in Him hedenoted the whole person. And what need is there of anything further? I think that the day would fail me if I were to try to collect or to tell everything that could be said on this subject. And what we have already said is enough, at any rate on this part of the subject, both for the exposition of the Creed, and for the requirements of our case, and for the limits of our book.","title":"Book VI.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_92_homily_lxxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But about not despairing, it is said, \"Doth he fall, and not arise?

Hear, therefore, how our true Prophet has taught us concerning these things; for, with respect to those who neglect to hear the words of wisdom, He speaks thus: `The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here, and they hear Him not.'\"[fn-25-P2505_733570:14-nf] But with respect to those who refused to repent of their evil deeds, He spoke thus: `The men of Nineve shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.'[fn-25-P2506_733866:15-nf] You see, therefore, how He condemned those who were instructed out of the law, by adducing the example of those who came from Gentile ignorance, and showing that the former were not even equal to those who seemed to live in error.

But, dearest brother, ecclesiastical discipline is not on that account to be forsaken, nor priestly censure to be relaxed, because we are disturbed with reproaches or are shaken with terrors; since Holy Scripture meets and warns us, saying, \"But he who presumes and is haughty, the man who boasts of himself, who hath enlarged his soul as hell, shall accomplish nothing.\"[fn-57-P5706_1763730:5-nf] And again: \"And fear not the words of a sinful man, for his glory shall be dung and worms. To-day he is lifted up, and to-morrow he shall not be found, because he is turned into his earth, and his thought shall perish.\"[fn-57-P5707_1763965:6-nf] And again: \"I have seen the wicked exalted, and raised above the cedars of Libanus: I went by, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, and his place was not found.\"[fn-57-P5708_1764152:7-nf] Exaltation, and puffing up, and arrogant and haughty boastfulness, spring not from the teaching of Christ who teaches humility, but from the spirit of Antichrist, whom the Lord rebukes by His prophet, saying, \"For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will place my throne above the stars of God: I will sit on a lofty mountain, above the lofty mountains to the north: I will ascend above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-57-P5709_1764630:8-nf] And he added, saying, \"Yet thou shalt descend into hell, to the foundations of the earth; and they that see thee shall wonder at thee.\"[fn-57-P5710_1764787:9-nf] Whence also divine Scripture threatens a like punishment to such in another place, and says, \"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is injurious and proud, and upon every one that is lifted up, and lofty.\"[fn-57-P5711_1765039:10-nf] By his mouth, therefore, and by his words, is every one at once betrayed; and whether he has Christ in his heart, or Antichrist, is discerned in his speaking, according to what the Lord says in His Gospel, \"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.\"[fn-57-P5712_1765524:11-nf] Whence also that rich sinner who implores help from Lazarus, then laid in Abraham's bosom, and established in a place of comfort, while he, writhing in torments, is consumed by the heats of burning flame, suffers most punishment of all parts of his body in his mouth and his tongue, because doubtless in his mouth and his tongue he had most sinned.[fn-57-P5713_1765897:12-nf] ","title":"Epistle LIV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"ANF-06","text":"31. Listen also to what I have to say on this other expression which has been adduced, viz., \"Christ, who redeemed us from the curse of the law.\"[fn-35-P3544_971877:275-nf] My view of this passage is that Moses, that illustrious servant of God, committed to those who wished to have the right vision,[fn-35-P3545_972026:276-nf] an emblematic[fn-35-P3546_972130:277-nf] law, and also a real law. Thus, to take an example, after God had made the world, and all things that are in it, in the space of six days, He rested on the seventh day from all His works by which statement I do not mean to affirm that He rested because He was fatigued, but that He did so as having brought to its perfection every creature which He had resolved to introduce. And yet in the sequel it, the new law, says: \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-35-P3547_973554:278-nf] Does that mean, then, that He is still making heaven, or sun, or man, or animals, or trees, or any such thing? Nay; but the meaning is, that when these visible objects were perfectly finished, He rested from that kind of work; while, however, He still continues to work at objects invisible with an inward mode of action,[fn-35-P3548_973895:279-nf] and saves men. In like manner, then, the legislator desires also that every individual amongst us should be devoted unceasingly to this kind of work, even as God Himself is; and he enjoins us consequently to rest continuously from secular things, and to engage in no worldly sort of work whatsoever; and this is called our Sabbath. This also he added in the law, that nothing senseless[fn-35-P3549_974390:280-nf] should be done but that we should be careful and direct our life in accordance with what is just and righteous. Now this law was suspended over men, discharging most sharply its curse against those who might transgress it. But because its subjects, too, were but men, and because, as happens also frequently I with us, controversies arose and injuries were inflicted, the law likewise at once, and with the severest equity, made any wrong that was done return upon the head of the wrong-doer;[fn-35-P3550_974964:281-nf] so that, for instance, if a poor man was minded to gather a bundle of wood upon the Sabbath, he was placed under the curse of the law, and exposed to the penality of instant death.[fn-35-P3551_975286:282-nf] The men, therefore, who had been brought up with the Egyptians were thus severely pressed by the restrictive power of the law, and they were unable to bear the penalties and the curses of the law. But, again, He who is ever the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, came and delivered those men from these pains and curses of the law, forgiving them their offences. And He indeed did not deal with them as Moses did, putting the severities of the law in force, and granting indulgence to no man for any offence; but He declared that if any man suffered an injury at the hands of his neighbour, he was to forgive him not once only, nor even twice or thrice, nor only seven times, but even unto seventy times seven;[fn-35-P3552_976014:283-nf] but that, on the other hand, if after all this the offender still continued to do such wrong, he ought then, as the last resource, to be brought under the law of Moses, and that no further pardon should be granted to the man who would thus persist in wrong-doing, even after having been forgiven unto seventy times seven. And He bestowed His forgiveness not only on a transgressor of such a character as that, but even on one who did offence to the Son of man. But if a man dealt thus with the Holy Spirit, He made him subject to two curses,-namely, to that of the law of Moses, and to that of His own law; to the law of Moses in truth in this present life, but to His own law at the time of the judgment: for His word is this: \"It shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.\"[fn-35-P3553_976851:284-nf] There is the law of Moses, thus, that in this world gives pardon to no such person; and there is the law of Christ that punishes in the future world. From this, therefore, mark how He confirms the law, not only not destroying it, but fulfilling it. Thus, then, He redeemed them from that curse of the law which belongs to the present life; and from this fact has come the appellation \"the curse of the law.\" This is the whole account which needs be given of that mode of speech. But, again, why the law is called the \"strength of sin, we shall at once explain in brief to the best of our ability. Now it is written that \"the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners.\"[fn-35-P3554_977606:285-nf] In these times, then, before Moses, there was no written law for transgressors; whence also Pharaoh, not knowing the strength of sin, transgressed in the way of afflicting the children of Israel with unrighteous burdens, and despised the Godhead, not only himself, but also all who were with him. But, not to make any roundabout statement, I shall explain the matter briefly as follows. There were certain persons of the Egyptian race mingling with the people of Moses, when that people was under his rule in the desert; and when Moses had taken his position on the mount, with the purpose of receiving the law, the impatient people, I do not mean those who were the true Israel, but those who had been intermixed with the Egyptians,[fn-35-P3555_978360:286-nf] set up a calf as their god, in accordance with their ancient custom of worshipping idols, with the notion that by such means they might secure themselves against ever having to pay the proper penalties for their iniquities.[fn-35-P3556_979141:287-nf] Thus were they altogether ignorant of the strength of their sin. But when Moses returned (from the mount) and found that out, he issued orders that those men should be put to death with the sword. From that occasion a beginning was made ill the correct perception of the strength of sin on the part of these persons through the instrumentality of the law of Moses, and for that reason the law has been called the \"strength of sin.\"","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":12,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-06","text":"42. But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary to Moses. And first, as to the word, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-37-P3743_1051433:461-nf] -that is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\"[fn-37-P3744_1051836:462-nf] But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just[fn-37-P3745_1051932:463-nf] that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then, to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence [fn-37-P3746_1052606:464-nf] of goodness, indeed, when one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, \"I make the rich man and the poor man,\"[fn-37-P3747_1052946:465-nf] whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.[fn-37-P3748_1053006:466-nf] Well, in that saying Jesus did; not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed[fn-37-P3749_1053192:467-nf] with pride, but have the gentle and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to think.[fn-37-P3750_1053388:468-nf] This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly. For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they are put into the treasury.[fn-37-P3751_1053611:469-nf] All too little, at the same time, is it[fn-37-P3752_1053672:470-nf] if gifts are cast into[fn-37-P3753_1053895:471-nf] the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man says, further, that it is written, that \"except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-37-P3754_1054456:472-nf] Wall, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;[fn-37-P3755_1054636:473-nf] so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently, to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable of it; but, at the, same time, to employ[fn-37-P3756_1054971:474-nf] riches for the work of righteousness and mercy, is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;[fn-37-P3757_1055410:475-nf] for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.[fn-37-P3758_1055469:476-nf] And this, the law's relation to the Sabbath, was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom's chamber, and who prepares the same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger, but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom's arrival; so that when he is come, the same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, \"Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? \"[fn-37-P3759_1056134:477-nf] And again, He did not actually reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead the cause of circumcision,[fn-37-P3760_1056364:478-nf] relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.[fn-37-P3761_1056521:479-nf] For what, indeed, can it profit a man to circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour? He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,[fn-37-P3762_1056873:480-nf] lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear splendid to men's view, we should inwardly he comparable only to ravening wolves,[fn-37-P3763_1057292:481-nf] or be likened to whited sepulchres.[fn-37-P3764_1057350:482-nf] For far above any person of that type of character is to be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless they happen also to he fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture has to say on this subject: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God? \"[fn-37-P3765_1057888:483-nf] What need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted with the compendious way of life,[fn-37-P3766_1058041:484-nf] and know that it shall he mine if only I can be pure in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit, that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and the prophets.[fn-37-P3767_1058313:485-nf] Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us yet clearer instruction on the subject, when be says, \"Or seek yea proof of that Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-37-P3768_1058522:486-nf] What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified in uncircumcision? For it is written: \"Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.\"[fn-37-P3769_1058856:487-nf] Consequently, as circumcision is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made forthwith a transgressor[fn-37-P3770_1059118:488-nf] of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised, and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life. For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in the mere ink,[fn-37-P3771_1059591:489-nf] in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.[fn-37-P3772_1059667:490-nf] Wherefore let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthen-ware in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,[fn-37-P3773_1060140:491-nf] are to be held in abhor-fence by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means[fn-37-P3774_1060481:492-nf] stand in need of that most profitless fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil. Far be it from me to do so! If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle's first epistle.[fn-37-P3775_1060860:493-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":12,"verse":47,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"ANF-06","text":"47. Then Manes, after silence had been secured among all, thus began his address: Like others, Archelaus, you too smite me with the most injurious words, notwithstanding that my sentiments on the subject of God are correct, and that I hold also a proper conception of Christ; and yet the family of the apostles is rather of the character that bears all things and endures all things, even although a man may assail them with revilings and curses. If it is your intention to persecute me, I am prepared for it: and if you wish to involve me in punishment, I shall not shrink from it; yea, if you mean even to put me to death, I am not afraid: \"For we ought to fear Him only who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\"[fn-38-P3849_1085852:562-nf] Archelaus said: Far be that from me! Not such is my intention. For what have you ever had to suffer at my hands, or at the hands of those who think with us, even when you were disparaging us and doing us injury, and when you were speaking in detraction of the traditions of our fathers, and when it was your aim to work the death of the souls of men that were well established in the truth, and that were kept with the most conscientious carefulness; for which, in truth, the whole wealth of the world would not sere as a sufficient compensation?[fn-38-P3850_1086419:563-nf] Nevertheless, what ground have you for assuming this position? What have you to show? Tell us this,-what signs of salvation have you to bring before us? For the bare bravado of words will not avail to satisfy the multitude here present, neither will it be enough to qualify them for recognising which of us holds the knowledge of the truth the more correctly. Wherefore, as you have got the opportunity of speaking first, tell us first to what particular head of the subject you wish us to direct the disputation. Manes said: If you do not offer a second time an unfair resistance to the positions which shall be stated with all due propriety by us, I shall speak with you; but if you mean to show yourself still in the character which on a former occasion I perceived you to take up, I shall address myself to Diodorus, and shall keep clear of your turbulence. Archelaus said: I have already expressed my opinion that we shall be simply abusing the occasion by the mere bandying of empty words. If any one on one side is formal to offer an unfair resistance, leave that to the decision of the judges. But now, tell us what you have got to advance. Manes said: If you do not mean a second time merely to gainsay the positions which are stated with all due correctness by me, I shall begin. Archelaus said: \"If not this,\" and \"if not that,\" are ways of speaking which mark out an ignorant man. You are ignorant, therefore, of what is in the future. But as to this particular thing which you do declare to be still future, to gainsay or not to gainsay is a matter in my own power. How, then, will that argument about the two trees stand, in which you place your trust as in a buckler of the most approved strength? For if I am of the contrary side, how do you require my obedience? And if, on the other hand, there is in me the disposition of obedience, how are you so greatly alarmed lest I should gainsay you? For you maintain that evil remains evil always, and that good remains good always, in utter ignorance of the force of your words. Manes said: Have I employed you as the advocate of my words, so that you may determine also the intelligence that may suit my knowledge? And how will you be able to explain what belongs to another person, when you cannot make what pertains to yourself clear? But if Diodorus now admits himself to be vanquished, my reasonings will then be addressed to you. If, however, he still stands out, and is prepared to speak, I beg you to give over and cease from interfering with the substantiating of the truth. For you are a strange sheep; nevertheless hereafter you will be introduced into the number of the same flock, as the voice of Jesus[fn-38-P3851_1089187:564-nf] also intimates,-that Jesus, namely, who appeared in the form of man indeed, and yet was not a man. Archelaus said: Are you not, then, of opinion that He was born of the Virgin Mary? Manes said: God forbid that I should admit that our Lord Jesus Christ came down to us through the natural womb of a woman! For He gives us His own testimony that He came down from the Father's bosom;[fn-38-P3852_1089673:565-nf] and again He says, \"He that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3853_1089773:566-nf] and. \"I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3854_1089867:567-nf] and once more, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-38-P3855_1089966:568-nf] And there are also innumerable other passages of a similar import, which point Him out as one that came, and not as one that was born. But if you are greater than He, and if you know better than He what is true, how do we yet believe Him? Archelaus said: Neither am I greater than He, for I am His servant nor can I be even the equal of my Lord, for I am His unprofitable servant; I am a disciple of His words, and I believe those things which have been spoken by Him, and I affirm that they are unchangeable. Manes said: A certain person somewhat like you once said to Him, \"Mary Thy mother, and Thy brethren, stand without; \"[fn-38-P3856_1090615:569-nf] and He took not the word kindly, but rebuked the person who had uttered it, saying, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"And He showed that those who did His will were both His mothers and His brethren. If you, however, mean to say that Mary was actually His mother, you place yourself in a position of considerable peril. For, without any doubt, it would be proved on the same principles that He had brethren also by her. Now tell me whether these brethren were begotten by Joseph or by the same Holy Spirit. For if you say that they were begotten by the same Holy Spirit, it will follow that we have had many Christs. And if you say that these were not begotten by the same Holy Spirit, and yet aver that He had brethren, then without doubt we shall be under the necessity of understanding that, in succession to the Spirit and after Gabriel, the most pure and spotless virgin[fn-38-P3857_1091524:570-nf] formed an actual marriage connection with Joseph. But if this is also a thing altogether absurd-I mean the supposition that she had any manner of intercourse with Joseph-tell me whether then He had brethren. Are you thus to fix the crime of adultery also on her, most sagacious Marcellus?[fn-38-P3858_1092182:571-nf] But if none of these suppositions suits the position of the Virgin undefiled, how will you make it out that He had brothers? And if you are unable to prove clearly to us that He had brethren, will it be any the easier for you to prove Mary to be His mother, in accordance with the saying of him who ventured to write,[fn-38-P3859_1092623:572-nf] \"Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without? \"Yet, although that man was bold enough to address Him thus, no one can be mightier or greater than this same person Himself who shows us His mother or His brethren. Nay, He does not deign even to hear it said that He is David's son.[fn-38-P3860_1092968:573-nf] The Apostle Peter, however, the most eminent of all the disciples, was able to acknowledge Him on that occasion, when all were putting forth the several opinions which they entertained respecting Him: for he said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; \"[fn-38-P3861_1093294:574-nf] and immediately He names him blessed, addressing him thus: \"For my heavenly Father hath revealed it unto thee.\" Observe what a difference there is between these two words which were spoken by Jesus. For to him who had said, \"Behold, Thy mother stands without,\" He replied, \"Who is my mother, or who are my brethren? \"But to him who said, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the living, God,\" He makes the return of a beatitude and benediction.
