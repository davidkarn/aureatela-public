{"verses":["The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the\nson of Abraham:","Abraham begot Isaac.  And Isaac begot Jacob.  And Jacob begot Judas\nand his brethren.","And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar.  And Phares begot Esron.\nAnd Esron begot Aram.","And Aram begot Aminadab.  And Aminadab begot Naasson.  And Naasson\nbegot Salmon.","And Salmon begot Booz of Rahab.  And Booz begot Obed of Ruth.  And\nObed begot Jesse.","And Jesse begot David the king.  And David the king begot Solomon,\nof her that had been the wife of Urias.","And Solomon begot Roboam.  And Roboam begot Abia.  And Abia begot\nAsa.","And Asa begot Josaphat.  And Josaphat begot Joram.  And Joram begot\nOzias.","And Ozias begot Joatham.  And Joatham begot Achaz.  And Achaz begot\nEzechias.","And Ezechias begot Manasses.  And Manasses begot Amon.  And Amon\nbegot Josias.","And Josias begot Jechonias and his brethren in the transmigration\nof Babylon.","And after the transmigration of Babylon, Jechonias begot\nSalathiel.  And Salathiel begot Zorobabel.","And Zorobabel begot Abiud.  And Abiud begot Eliacim.  And Eliacim\nbegot Azor.","And Azor begot Sadoc.  And Sadoc begot Achim.  And Achim begot\nEliud.","And Eliud begot Eleazar.  And Eleazar begot Mathan.  And Mathan\nbegot Jacob.","And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born\nJesus, who is called Christ.","So all the generations from Abraham to David, are fourteen\ngenerations.  And from David to the transmigration of Babylon, are\nfourteen generations:  and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ\nare fourteen generations.","Now the generation of Christ was in this wise.  When as his mother\nMary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found\nwith child, of the Holy Ghost.","Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing\npublicly to expose her, was minded to put her away privately.","But while he thought on these things, behold the Angel of the\nLord appeared to him in his sleep, saying:  Joseph, son of David, fear\nnot to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in\nher, is of the Holy Ghost.","And she shall bring forth a son:  and thou shalt call his name\nJesus.  For he shall save his people from their sins.","Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord\nspoke by the prophet, saying:","Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and\nthey shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with\nus.","And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had\ncommanded him, and took unto him his wife.","And he knew her not till she brought forth her first born son:\nand he called his name Jesus."]}
