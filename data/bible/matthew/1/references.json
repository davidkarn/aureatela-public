For this reason, then, if both the Son and the Holy Spirit are sent thither where they were, we must inquire, how that sending, whether of the Son or of the Holy Spirit, is to be understood; for of the Father alone, we nowhere read that He is sent. Now, of the Son, the apostle writes thus: \"But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.\"[fn-4-P476_170738:23-nf] \"He sent,\" he says, \"His Son, made of a woman.\" And by this term, woman,[fn-4-P477_170831:24-nf] what Catholic does not know that he did not wish to signify the privation of virginity; but, according to a Hebraism, the difference of sex?

Moreover, He could not be sent by the Father without the Holy Spirit, not only because the Father, when He sent Him, that is, when He made Him of a woman, is certainly understood not to have so made Him without His own Spirit; but also because it is most plainly and expressly said in the Gospel in answer to the Virgin Mary, when she asked of the angel, \"How shall this be?\" \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\"[fn-4-P478_171744:25-nf] And Matthew says, \"She was found with child of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-4-P479_171829:26-nf] Although, too, in the prophet Isaiah, Christ Himself is understood to say of His own future advent, \"And now the Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me.\"[fn-4-P480_171999:27-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"443","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"5. I have spoken plainly, lest you might ignorantly suppose that Scripture sanctions your grief; and that, if you err, you have reason on your side. And, so far, my words have been addressed to the average Christian woman. But now it will not be so. For in your case, as I well know, renunciation of the world has been complete; you have rejected and trampled on the delights of life, and you give yourself daily to fasting, to reading, and to prayer. Like Abraham,[fn-12-P1255_269864:849-nf] you desire to leave your country and kindred, to forsake Mesopotamia and the Chaldaeans, to enter into the promised land. Dead to the world before your death, you have spent all your mere worldly substance upon the poor, or have bestowed it upon your children. I am the more surprised, therefore, that you should act in a manner which in others would justly call for reprehension. You call to mind Blaesilla's companionship, her conversation, and her endearing ways; and you cannot endure the thought that you have lost them all. I pardon you the tears of a mother, but I ask you to restrain your grief. When I think of the parent I cannot blame you for weeping: but when I think of the Christian and the recluse, the mother disappears from my view. Your wound is still fresh, and ant touch of mine, however gentle, is more likely to inflame than to heal it. Yet why do you not try to overcome by reason a grief which time must inevitably assuage? Naomi, fleeing because of famine to the land of Moab, there lost her husband and her sons. Yet when she was thus deprived of her natural protectors, Ruth, a stranger, never left her side.[fn-12-P1256_271023:850-nf] And see what a great thing it is to comfort a lonely woman Ruth, for her reward, is made an ancestress of Christ.[fn-12-P1257_271152:851-nf] Consider the great trials which Job endured, and you will see that you are over-delicate. Amid the ruins of his house, the pains of his sores, his countless bereavements, and, last of all, the snares laid for him by his wife, he still lifted up his eyes to heaven, and maintained his patience unbroken. I know what you are going to say \"All this befell him as a righteous man, to try his righteousness.\" Well, choose which alternative you please. Either you are holy, in which case God is putting your holiness to the proof; or else you are a sinner, in which case you have no right to complain.

Oh! the madness and folly of those who have forsaken the teaching of the book of Proverbs, \"My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother,\"[fn-18-P1835_447291:1281-nf] and have turned to error, and say to the fool that he shall be their leader, and do not despise the foolish things which are said by the foolish man, even as the scripture bears witness, \"The foolish man speaketh foolishly, and his heart understandeth vanity.\"[fn-18-P1836_447575:1282-nf] I beseech you, dearly beloved, and by the love which I feel towards you, I implore you-as though it were my own members on which I would have pity[fn-18-P1837_447752:1283-nf] -by word and letter to fulfil that which is written, \"Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?\"[fn-18-P1838_447935:1284-nf] Origen's words are the words of an enemy, hateful and repugnant to God and to His saints; and not only those which I have quoted, but countless others. For it is not now my intention to argue against all his opinions. Origen has not lived in my day, nor has he robbed me. I have not conceived a dislike to him nor quarrelled with him because of an inheritance or of any worldly matter; but-to speak plainly-I grieve, and grieve bitterly, to see numbers of my brothers, and of those in particular who show the most promise, and have reached the highest rank in the sacred ministry,[fn-18-P1839_448541:1285-nf] deceived by his persuasive arguments, and made by his most perverse teaching the food of the devil, whereby the saying is fulfilled: \"He derides every stronghold, and his fare is choice, and he hath gathered captives as the sand.\"[fn-18-P1840_448794:1286-nf] But may God free you, my brother, and the holy people of Christ which is intrusted to you, and all the brothers who are with you, and especially the presbyter Rufinus, from the heresy of Origen, and other heresies, and from the perdition to which they lead. For, if for one word or for two opposed to the faith many heresies have been rejected by the Church, how much more shall he be held a heretic who has contrived such perverse interpretations and such mischievous doctrines to destroy the faith, and has in fact declared himself the enemy of the Church! For, among other wicked things, he has presumed to say this, too, that Adam lost the image of God, although Scripture nowhere declares that he did. Were it so, never would all the creatures in the world be subject to Adam's seed-that is, to the entire human race; yet, in the words of the apostle, everything \"is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind.\"[fn-18-P1841_449738:1287-nf] For never would all things be subjected to men if men had not-together with their authority over all-the image of God. But the divine Scripture conjoins and associates with this the grace of the blessing which was conferred upon Adam and upon the generations which descended from him. No one can by twisting the meaning of words presume to say that this grace of God was given to one only, and that he alone was made in the image of God (he and his wife, that is, for while he was formed of clay she was made of one of his ribs), but that those who were subsequently conceived in the womb and not born as was Adam did not possess God's image, for the Scripture immediately subjoins the following statement: \"And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years,[fn-18-P1842_450513:1288-nf] and knew Eve his wife, and she bare him a son in his image and after his likeness, and called his name Seth.\"[fn-18-P1843_450707:1289-nf] And again, in the tenth generation, two thousand two hundred and forty-two years afterwards,[fn-18-P1844_450845:1290-nf] God, to vindicate His own image and to show that the grace which He had given to men still continued in them, gives the following commandment: \"Flesh ...with the blood thereof shall ye not eat. And surely your blood will I require at the hand of every man that sheddeth it; for in the image of God have I made man.\"[fn-18-P1845_451264:1291-nf] From Noah to Abraham ten generations passed away,[fn-18-P1846_451362:1292-nf] and from Abraham's time to David's, fourteen more,[fn-18-P1847_451438:1293-nf] and these twenty-four generations make up, taken together, two thousand one hundred and seventeen years.[fn-18-P1848_451565:1294-nf] Yet the Holy Spirit in the thirty-ninth[fn-18-P1849_451663:1295-nf] psalm, while lamenting that all men walk in a vain show, and that they are subject to sins, speaks thus: \"For all that every man walk eth in the image.\"[fn-18-P1850_451891:1296-nf] Also after David's time, in the reign of Solomon his son, we read a somewhat similar reference to the divine likeness. For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: \"God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity.\"[fn-18-P1851_452211:1297-nf] And again, about eleven hundred and eleven years afterwards, we read in the New Testament that men have not lost the image of God. For James, an apostle and brother of the Lord, whom I have mentioned above-that we may not be entangled in the snares of Origen-teaches us that man does possess God's image and likeness. For, after a somewhat discursive account of the human tongue, he has gone on to say of it: \"It is an unruly evil ...therewith bless we God, even the Father and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.\"[fn-18-P1852_452779:1298-nf] Paul, too, the \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-18-P1853_452836:1299-nf] who in his preaching has fully maintained the doctrine of the gospel, instructs us that man is made in the image and after the likeness of God. \"A man,\" he says, \"ought not to wear long hair, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.\"[fn-18-P1854_453099:1300-nf] He speaks of \"the image\" simply, but explains the nature of the likeness by the word \"glory.\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"699","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8.

Now this ratio of the single to the double arises, no doubt, from the ternary number, since one added to two makes three; but the whole which these make reaches to the senary, for one and two and three make six. And this number is on that account called perfect, because it is completed in its own parts: for it has these three, sixth, third, and half; nor is there any other part found in it, which we can call an aliquot part. The sixth part of it, then, is one; the third part, two; the half,three. But one and two and three complete the same six. And Holy Scripture commends to us the perfection of this number, especially in this, that God finished His works in six days, and on the sixth day man was made in the image of God.[fn-8-P861_330327:42-nf] And the Son of God came and was made the Son of man, that He might re-create us after the image of God, in the sixth age of the human race. For that is now the present age, whether a thousand years apiece are assigned to each age, or whether we trace out memorable and remarkable epochs or turning-points of time in the divine Scriptures, so that the first age is to be found from Adam until Noah, and the second thence onwards to Abraham, and then next, after the division of Matthew the evangelist, from Abraham to David, from David to the carrying away to Babylon, and from thence to the travail of the Virgin,[fn-8-P862_330958:43-nf] which three ages joined to those other two make five. Accordingly, the nativity of the Lord began the sixth, which is now going onwards until the hidden end of time. We recognize also in this senary number a kind of figure of time, in that threefold mode of division, by which we compute one portion of time before the Law; a second, under the Law; a third, under grace. In which last time we have received the sacrament of renewal, that we may be renewed also in the end of time, in every part, by the resurrection of the flesh, and so may be made whole from our entire infirmity, not only of soul, but also of body. And thence that woman is understood to be a type of the church, who was made whole and upright by the Lord, after she had been bowed by infirmity through the binding of Satan. For those words of the Psalm lament such hidden enemies: \"They bowed down my soul.\"[fn-8-P863_331854:44-nf] And this woman had her infirmity eighteen years, which is thrice six. And the months of eighteen years are found in number to be the cube of six, viz. six times six times six. Nearly, too, in the same place in the Gospel is that fig tree, which was convicted also by the third year of its miserable barrenness. But intercession was made for it, that it might be let alone that year, that year, that if it bore fruit, well; if otherwise, it should be cut clown.[fn-8-P864_332333:45-nf] For both three years belong to the same threefold division, and the months of three years make the square of six, which is six times six.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_06_prolegomena","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"The short chapter on the Incarnation has a special value in view of the author's connection with the Nestorian Controversy. \"It is worth while,\" he writes in it, \"to exhibit what we hold concerning the Incarnation, for this exposition proclaims more clearly the providence of the God of all. In his forged fables Valentinus maintained a distinction between the only-begotten and the Word, and further between the Christ within the pleroma and Jesus, and also the Christ who is without. He said that Jesus became man, by putting on the Christ that is without, and assuming a body of the substance of the soul; and that He made a passage only through the Virgin, having assumed nothing of the nature of man. Basilides in like manner distinguished between the only-begotten, the Word and the Wisdom. Cerdon, on the other hand, Marcion, and Manes, said that the Christ appeared as man, though he had nothing human. Cerinthus maintained that Jesus was generated of Joseph and Mary after the common manner of men, but that the Christ came down from on high on Jesus. The Ebionites, the Theodotians, the Artemonians, and Photinians said that the Christ was bare man born of the Virgin. Arius and Eunomius taught that He assumed a body, but that the Godhead discharged the function of the soul. Apollinarius held that the body of the Saviour had a soul,[fn-7-P790_119873:148-nf] but had not the reasonable soul; for, according to his views, intelligence was superfluous, God the Word being present. I have stated the opinions taught by the majority of heresies with the wish of making plain the truth taught by the church. Now the church makes no distinction between (ton auton onomazei) the Son, the only begotten, God the Word, the Lord the Saviour, and Jesus Christ. `Son,' `only begotten,' `God the Word,' and `Lord,' He was called before the Incarnation; and is so called also after the Incarnation; but after the Incarnation the same (Lord) was called Jesus Christ, deriving the titles from the facts. `Jesus' is interpreted to mean the Saviour, whereof Gabriel is witness in his words to the Virgin `Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.'[fn-7-P791_120696:149-nf] But He was styled `Christ' on account of the unction of the Spirit. So the Psalmist David says `Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.'[fn-7-P792_120900:150-nf] And through the Prophet Isaiah the Lord Himself says `The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me.'[fn-7-P793_121044:151-nf] Thus the Lord Himself taught us to understand the prophecy, for when He had come into the synagogue, and opened the book of the Prophets, He read the passage quoted, and said to those present `This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your ears.'[fn-7-P794_121307:152-nf] The great Peter, too, preached in terms harmonious with the prophets, for in his explanation of the mystery to Cornelius he said `That word ye know which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee after the Baptism which John preached; how God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and with power.'[fn-7-P795_121647:153-nf] Hence it is clear that He is called Christ on account of the unction of the spirit. But he was anointed not as God, but as man. And as in His human nature He was anointed, after the Incarnation He was called also `Christ.' But yet there is no distinction between God the Word and the Christ, for God the Word incarnate was named Christ Jesus. And He was incarnate that He might renew the nature corrupted by sin. The reason of His taking all the nature which had sinned was that He might heal all. For He did not take the nature of the body using it as a veil of His Godhead, according to the wild teaching of Arius and Eunomius; for it had been easy for Him even without a body to be made visible as He was seen of old by Abraham, Jacob and the rest of the saints. But he wished the very nature that had been worsted to beat down the enemy and win the victory. For this reason He took both a body and a reasonable soul. For Holy Scripture does not divide man in a threefold division, but states that this living being consists of a body and a soul.[fn-7-P796_122728:154-nf] For God after forming the body out of the dust breathed into it the soul and shewed it to be two natures not three. And the same Lord in the Gospels says, `Fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul,'[fn-7-P797_122990:155-nf] and many similar passages may be found in divine Scripture. And that He did not assume man's nature in its perfection, contriving it as a veil for His Godhead, according to the heretics' fables, but achieving victory by means of the first fruits for the whole race, is truly witnessed and accurately taught by the divine apostle, for in His Epistle to the Romans, when unveiling the mystery of the Incarnation, he writes `Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that is to come.'[fn-7-P798_123817:156-nf] ","title":"Prolegomena","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":455,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_08_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"But why did He appear not to all, but to the Apostles only?[fn-2-P208_50373:13-nf] Because to the many it would have seemed a mere apparition, inasmuch as they understood not the secret of the mystery For if the disciples themselves were at first incredulous and were troubled, and needed the evidence of actual touch with the hand, and of His eating with them, how would it have fared in all likelihood with the multitude? For this reason therefore by the miracles [wrought by the Apostles] He renders the evidence of His Resurrection unequivocal, so that not only the men of those times-this is what would come of the ocular proof-but also all men thereafter, should be certain of the fact, that He was risen. Upon this ground also we argue with unbelievers. For if He did not rise again, but remains dead, how did the Apostles perform miracles in His name? But they did not, say you, perform miracles? How then was our religion eqnoj instituted? For this certainly they will not controvert nor impugn what we see with our eyes: so that when they say that no miracles took place, they inflict a worse stab[fn-2-P209_51508:14-nf] upon themselves. For this would be the greatest of miracles, that without any miracles, the whole world should have eagerly come to be taken in the nets of twelve poor and illiterate men.

For this He then remained forty days on earth, furnishing in this length of time the sure evidence of their seeing Him in His own proper Person, that they might not suppose that what they saw was a phantom.

Again, he calls her wife, and then says the only reason why she was betrothed was that she might one day be married. And, for fear we might not think that enough, \"the word used,\" he says, \"is betrothed and not intrusted, that is to say, not yet a wife, not yet united by the bond of wedlock.\" But when he continues, \"the Evangelist would never have applied the words, before they came together to persons who were not to come together, any more than one says, before he dined, when the man is not going to dine,\" I know not whether to grieve or laugh. Shall I convict him of ignorance, or accuse him of rashness? Just as if, supposing a person to say, \"Before dining in harbour I sailed to Africa,\" his words could not hold good unless he were compelled some day to dine in harbour. If I choose to say, \"the apostle Paul before he went to Spain was put in fetters at Rome,\" or (as I certainly might) \"Helvidius, before he repented, was cut off by death,\" must Paul on being released at once go to Spain, or must Helvidius repent after death, although the Scripture says[fn-60-P6008_1777966:4-nf] \"In sheol who shall give thee thanks?\" Must we not rather understand that the preposition before, although it frequently denotes order in time, yet sometimes refers only to order in thought? So that there is no necessity, if sufficient cause intervened to prevent it, for our thoughts to be realized. When, then, the Evangelist says before they came together, he indicates the time immediately preceding marriage, and shows that matters were so far advanced that she who had been betrothed was on the point of becoming a wife. As though he said, before they kissed and embraced, before the consummation of marriage, she was found to be with child. And she was found to be so by none other than Joseph, who watched the swelling womb of his betrothed with the anxious glances, and, at this time, almost the privilege, of a husband. Yet it does not follow, as the previous examples showed, that he had intercourse with Mary after her delivery, when his desires had been quenched by the fact that she had already conceived. And although we find it said to Joseph in a dream, \"Fear not to take Mary thy wife\"; and again, \"Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife,\" no one ought to be disturbed by this, as though, inasmuch as she is called wife, she ceases to be betrothed, for we know it is usual in Scripture to give the title to those who are betrothed. The following evidence from Deuteronomy establishes the point.[fn-60-P6009_1779459:5-nf] \"If the man,\" says the writer, \"find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her, he shall surely die, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife.\" And in another place,[fn-60-P6010_1779705:6-nf] \"If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.\" Elsewhere also,[fn-60-P6011_1780155:7-nf] \"And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.\" But if anyone feels a doubt as to why the Virgin conceived after she was betrothed rather than when she had no one betrothed to her, or, to use the Scripture phrase, no husband, let me explain that there were three reasons. First, that by the genealogy of Joseph, whose kinswoman Mary was, Mary's origin might also be shown. Secondly, that she might not in accordance with the law of Moses be stoned as an adulteress. Thirdly, that in her flight to Egypt she might have some solace, though it was that of a guardian rather than a husband. For who at that time would have believed the Virgin's word that she had conceived of the Holy Ghost, and that the angel Gabriel had come and announced the purpose of God? and would not all have given their opinion against her as an adulteress, like Susanna? for at the present day, now that the whole world has embraced the faith, the Jews argue that when Isaiah says,[fn-60-P6012_1781246:8-nf] \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,\" the Hebrew word denotes a young woman, not a virgin, that is to say, the word is Almah, not Bethulah, a position which, farther on, we shall dispute more in detail. Lastly, excepting Joseph, and Elizabeth, and Mary herself, and some few others who, we may suppose, heard the truth from them, all considered Jesus to be the son of Joseph. And so far was this the case that even the Evangelists, expressing the prevailing opinion, which is the correct rule for a historian, call him the father of the Saviour, as, for instance,[fn-60-P6013_1781878:9-nf] \"And he (that is, Simeon) came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law;\" and elsewhere,[fn-60-P6014_1782088:10-nf] \"And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.\" And afterwards,[fn-60-P6015_1782202:11-nf] \"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew not of it.\" Observe also what Mary herself, who had replied to Gabriel with the words,[fn-60-P6016_1782433:12-nf] \"How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\" says concerning Joseph,[fn-60-P6017_1782519:13-nf] \"Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.\" We have not here, as many maintain, the utterance of Jews or of mockers. The Evangelists call Joseph father: Mary confesses he was father. Not (as I said before) that Joseph was really the father of the Saviour: but that, to preserve the reputation of Mary, he was regarded by all as his father, although, before he heard the admonition of the angel,[fn-60-P6018_1782980:14-nf] \"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,\" he had thoughts of putting her away privily; which shows that he well knew that the child conceived was not his. But we have said enough, more with the aim of imparting instruction than of answering an opponent, to show why Joseph is called the father of our Lord, and why Mary is called Joseph's wife. This also at once answers the question why certain persons are called his brethren.","title":"The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_08_the_perpetual_virginity_of_blessed_mary","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8.

A physician, by ever so great attention, could not so speedily rid a man of the fever, as a patient man would cool, by the breath of his own words, a person who was passionate and burning with wrath.

God promises a Kingdom, and is despised: the Devil helps us to hell, and he is honored! Here God, there Devil. But let us see the difference of the tasks enjoined. For if there were none of these considerations in the case: if it were not, here God, there Devil; not, here one helping to a kingdom, there to a hell: the nature itself of the tasks enjoined were sufficient to induce us to comply with the former For what does each enjoin?

O brother, how good a thing it is to remember that you are a Christian! To believe, might perhaps be enough; but still, since you persist in discussion, there is no harm, nay there is even benefit, if a firm faith precede it; let us not suppose, then, that human nature cannot be corrupted by sin, but rather, believing, from the inspired Scriptures, that it is corrupted by sin, let our inquiry be how this could possibly have come about. Since, then, we have already learnt that sin is not a substance, do we not consider, not to mention any other example, that not to eat is also not a substance? Because such abstinence is withdrawal from a substance, inasmuch as food is a substance. To abstain, then, from food is not a substance; and yet the substance of our body, if it does altogether abstain from food, so languishes, is so impaired by broken health, is so exhausted of strength, so weakened and broken with very weariness, that even if it be in any way able to continue alive, it is hardly capable of being restored to the use of that food, by abstaining from which it became so corrupted and injured. In the same way sin is not a substance; but God is a substance, yea the height of substance and only true sustenance of the reasonable creature.

Ye confess that in the case of Moses a perfectly straight rod became like a serpent, and was terrible to him who cast it down, and he who before held the rod fast, fled from it as from a serpent; for a serpent in truth it was: but he fled not because he feared that which he held, but because he dreaded Him that bad changed it. A rod had teeth and eyes like a serpent: do then seeing eyes grow out of a rod, and cannot a child be born of a virgin's womb, if God wills? For I say nothing of the fact that Aaron's rod also produced in a single night what other trees produce in several year. For who knows not that a rod, after losing its bark, will never sprout, not even if it be planted in the midst of rivers?

And very many of them, considering this, even before His passion, but chiefly after His resurrection, believed on Him, of whom it was predicted, \"Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.\"[fn-35-P3545_1925150:92-nf] But the rest are blinded, of whom it was predicted, \"Let their table be made before them a trap, and a retribution, and a stumbling-block. Let their eyes be darkened lest they see, and bow down their back alway.\"[fn-35-P3546_1925404:93-nf] Therefore, when they do not believe our Scriptures, their own, which they blindly read, are fulfilled in them, lest perchance any one should say that the Christians have forged these prophecies about Christ which are quoted under the name of the sibyl, or of others, if such there be, who do not belong to the Jewish people. For us, indeed, those suffice which are quoted from the books of our enemies, to whom we make our acknowledgment, on account of this testimony which, in spite of themselves, they contribute by their possession of these books, while they themselves are dispersed among all nations, wherever the Church of Christ is spread abroad. For a prophecy about this thing was sent before in the Psalms, which they also read, where it is written, \"My God, His mercy shall prevent me. My God hath shown me concerning mine enemies, that Thou shalt not slay them, lest they should at last forget Thy law: disperse them in Thy might.\"[fn-35-P3547_1926387:94-nf] Therefore God has shown the Church in her enemies the Jews the grace of His compassion, since, as saith the apostle, \"their offence is the salvation of the Gentiles.\"[fn-35-P3548_1926578:95-nf] And therefore He has not slain them, that is, He has not let the knowledge that they are Jews be lost in them, although they have been conquered by the Romans, lest they should forget the law of God, and their testimony should be of no avail in this matter of which we treat. But it was not enough that he should say, \"Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law,\" unless he had also added, \"Disperse them;\" because if they had only been in their own land with that testimony of the Scriptures, and not every where, certainly the Church which is everywhere could not have had them as witnesses among all nations to the prophecies which were sent before concerning Christ.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_22_homily_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And how, one may ask, did He not destroy it? in what way did He rather fulfill either the law or the prophets?

For these exaggerations stand opposed to one another, while between them lies the way of the doctrines of the Gospel, beautified by the footprints of prophets and apostles, and of all who after them have been conspicuous for the gift of teaching. I was anxious to adduce their opinions, and to point out how they bear witness in favour of my own, but I want more words than a letter allows room for, wherefore I have written summarily what I have been taught about the incarnation of the only begotten; I send my statement to your godly excellency.[fn-59-P5974_1482225:244-nf] I bare written not with the object of teaching others, but of making my defence against the accusations brought against me, and of explaining my sentiments to those who are ignorant of them. After your holiness has read what I have written, if you find it in conformity with the apostolic doctrines, I hope you trill confirm my opinion by what you reply-if, on the contrary, anything that I have said jars with the divine teaching, I request to be told of it by your holiness. For, though I have spent much time in teaching, I still need one to teach me. \"We know,\" says the divine Apostle \"in part,\"[fn-59-P5975_1482879:245-nf] and again he says, \"If any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.\"[fn-59-P5976_1483010:246-nf] So I hope that I may hear the truth from your holiness, and that you may also give heed to the calm of the Church, and fight for the divine doctrines.

Once let these be made clear, and there will be no ambiguity left about the passion. We will therefore first, to those who endeavour to contradict us, put this enquiry. Which of the names given to the only begotten Son of God are anterior to the incarnation, and which posterior, or rather, connected with the operation of the oeconomy? They will reply that the terms anterior are, \"God the Word,\" \"only begotten Son,\" \"Almighty,\" and \"Lord of all creation\"; and that the names \"Jesus Christ\" belong to the incarnation. For, after the incarnation, God the Word, the only begotten Son of God is called Jesus Christ; for \"Behold\" He says \"unto you is born this day Christ the Lord\"[fn-61-P6156_1547539:330-nf] and because others had been called christs, priests, kings, and prophets, lest any one should suppose Him to be like unto them, the angels conjoined the title Lord with that of Christ, in order to prove the supreme dignity of Him that was born. And, again, Gabriel says to the blessed Virgin, \"Behold thou shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son and shalt call His name Jesus\"[fn-61-P6157_1547947:331-nf] \"for He shall save His people from their sins.\"[fn-61-P6158_1548014:332-nf] Before the incarnation, however, He was never called either Christ or Jesus. For truly the divine Prophets, in their predictions of things to come, used the words, just as they prophesied about the birth, the cross, and the passion, when the events had not yet come to pass. Nevertheless, even after the incarnation He is called God the Word, Lord, Almighty, only begotten Son,Maker, and Creator. For He was not made man by mutation, but, remaining just what He was, assumed what we are, for \"Being in the form of God,\" to use the words of the divine Apostle \"He took the form of a servant.\"[fn-61-P6159_1548662:333-nf] On this account, therefore, even after the incarnation, He is called also by the titles which are anterior to the incarnation, since His nature is invariable and immutable. But when relating the passion the divine Scripture nowhere uses the term God, since that is the name of the absolute nature. No one on hearing the words \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"[fn-61-P6160_1549088:334-nf] and similar expressions, would suppose that the flesh existed before the ages, or is of one substance with the God of the universe, or was Creator of the world. Every one knows that these terms are proper to the Godhead. Nor would any one on reading the genealogy of St. Matthew suppose that David and Abraham according to nature were forefathers of God, for it is the assumed nature which is derived from them.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"435","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Copious additional evidence may be found whereby it may be learnt without difficulty that our Lord Jesus Christ is no other person than the Son which completes the Trinity.

For Arius and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten Son of God to be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to His godhead what is said in lowly and human sense; establishing by such means the difference of substance and the unlikeness. Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This goes beyond even the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the universe a creature. Furthermore he blasphemes against the Holy Ghost, denying that It proceeds from the Father, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of the Son. Here we have the fruit of the Apollinarian seed; here we come near the evil husbandry of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the Egyptian, viler children of a vile father. This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of souls, ought to make abortive while yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to mankind, is cherished by these excellent persons, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own ruin and to that of all who will listen to them.We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep our heritage untouched; and the faith which we have received, and in which we have been ourselves baptized, and baptize others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last days for us men and our salvation (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as touching the manhood. For there was an union of two natures. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we believe it to have been made without confusion, in obedience to the word of the Lord to the Jews, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6501_1678851:549-nf] If on the contrary there had been mixture and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said \"Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised.\" But now, to show that there is a distinction between God according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,\" clearly teaching that it was not God who was undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destructions while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in obedience to the divine Scriptures that we acknowledge the Christ to be God and man. That our Lord Jesus Christ is God is asserted by the blessed evangelist John \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was. God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"[fn-65-P6502_1679824:550-nf] And again, \"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-65-P6503_1679932:551-nf] And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-65-P6504_1680039:552-nf] And \"I and my Father are one\"[fn-65-P6505_1680089:553-nf] and \"I am in the Father and the Father in me,\"[fn-65-P6506_1680155:554-nf] and the blessed Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews says \"Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power\"[fn-65-P6507_1680368:555-nf] and in the epistle to the Philippians \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-65-P6508_1680634:556-nf] And in the Epistle to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever. Amen.\"[fn-65-P6509_1680830:557-nf] And in the epistle to Titus \"Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\"[fn-65-P6510_1680985:558-nf] And Isaiah exclaims \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called, Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, powerful, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the Age to come.\"[fn-65-P6511_1681278:559-nf] And again \"In chains they shall come over and they shall fall unto thee. They shall make supplication unto thee shying, surely God is in thee anti there is none else, there is no God. Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.\"[fn-65-P6512_1681567:560-nf] The name Emmanuel, however, indicates both God and man, for it is interpreted in the Gospel to mean \"God with us,\"[fn-65-P6513_1681721:561-nf] that is to say \"God in man,\" God in our nature. And the divine Jeremiah too utters the prediction \"This is our God and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison with him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved and afterward did He show Himself upon earth and conversed with men.\"[fn-65-P6514_1682104:562-nf] And countless other passages might be found as well in the holy gospels and in the writings of the apostles as in the predictions of the prophets, setting forth that our Lord Jesus Christ is very God.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"480","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Wherefore all the human qualities of the Lord Christ, hunger, I mean, and thirst and weariness, sleep, fear, sweat, prayer, and ignorance, and the like, we affirm to belong to our nature which God the Word assumed and united to Himself in effecting our salvation. But the restitution of motion to the maimed, the resurrection of the dead, the supply of loaves, and all the other miracles we believe to be works of the divine power. In this sense I say that the same Lord Christ both suffers and destroys suffering; suffers, that is, as touching the visible, and destroys suffering as touching the ineffably indwelling Godhead. This is proved beyond question by the narrative of the holy evangelists, from whom we learn that when lying in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes, He was announced by a star, worshipped by magi and hymned by angels. Thus we reverent discern that the swaddling bands and the want of a bed and all the poverty belonged to the manhood; while the journey of the magi and the guiding of the star and the company of the angels proclaim the Godhead of the unseen. In like manner He makes His escape into Egypt and avoids the fury of Herod by flight,[fn-65-P6538_1688697:576-nf] for He was man; but as the Prophet says \"He shakes the idols of Egypt,\"[fn-65-P6539_1688799:577-nf] for He was by nature God. He is circumcised; He keeps the law; and offers offerings of purification, because He sprang from the root of Jesse. And, as man, He was under the law; and afterwards did away with the law and gave the new covenant, because He was a lawgiver and had promised by the prophets that He Himself would give it. He was baptized by John; and this shews His sharing what is ours. He is testified to by the Father from on high and is pointed out by the Spirit; this proclaims Him eternal. He hungered; but He fed many thousands with five loaves; the latter is divine, the former human. He thirsted and He asked for water; but He was the well of life; the former of His human weakness, the latter of His divine power. He fell asleep in the boat, but he put the tempest of the sea to sleep; the former of His human nature, the latter of His efficient and creative power which has gifted all things with their being. He was weary as he walked; but He healed the halt and raised dead men from their tombs; the former of human weakness, the latter of a power passing that of this world. He feared death and He destroyed death; the former shows that He was mortal, the latter that He was immortal or rather giver of life. \"He was crucified,\" as the blessed Paul says \"through weakness.\"[fn-65-P6540_1690119:578-nf] But as the same Paul says \"Yet He liveth by the power of God.\"[fn-65-P6541_1690207:579-nf] Let that word \"weakness\" teach us that He was not nailed to the tree as the Almighty, the Uncircumscribed, the Immutable and Invariable, but that the nature quickened by the power of God, was according to the Apostle's teaching dead and buried, both death and burial being proper to the form of the servant. \"He broke the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder\"[fn-65-P6542_1690605:580-nf] and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised His own temple. These are proofs of the form of God in accordance with the Lord's words \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6543_1690834:581-nf] Thus in the one Christ through the sufferings we contemplate the manhood and through the miracles we apprehend the Godhead. We do not divide the two natures into two Christs, and we know that of the Father God the Word was begotten and that of the seed of Abraham and David our nature was assumed. Wherefore also the blessed Paul says when discoursing of Abraham \"He saith not and to seeds as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed which is Christ,\"[fn-65-P6544_1691305:582-nf] and writing to Timothy he says \"Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel.\"[fn-65-P6545_1691456:583-nf] And to the Romans he writes \"Concerning His son Jesus Christ ...which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-65-P6546_1691602:584-nf] And again \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.\"[fn-65-P6547_1691705:585-nf] And the Evangelist writes \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham,\"[fn-65-P6548_1691836:586-nf] and the blessed Peter in the Acts says David \"being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, he seeing this before spake of his resurrection,\"[fn-65-P6549_1692098:587-nf] and God says to Abraham \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,\"[fn-65-P6550_1692204:588-nf] and Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of His roots; and there shall rest upon Him[fn-65-P6551_1692364:589-nf] the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-65-P6552_1692772:590-nf] And a little further on \"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek; and His rest shall be glorious.\"[fn-65-P6553_1693018:591-nf] ","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"491","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"The slander of the libellers that represent me as worshipping two sons is refuted by the plain facts of the case.

Mark follows him closely, and looks like his attendant and epitomizer.[fn-10-P1044_412024:5-nf] For in his narrative he gives nothing in concert with John apart from the others: by himself separately, he has little to record; in conjunction with Luke, as distinguished from the rest, he has still less; but in concord with Matthew, he has a very large number of passages. Much, too, he narrates in words almost numerically and identically the same as those used by Matthew, where the agreement is either with that evangelist alone, or with him in connection with the rest. On the other hand, Luke appears to have occupied himself rather with the priestly lineage and character[fn-10-P1045_412874:6-nf] of the Lord. For although in his own way he carries the descent back to David, what he has followed is not the royal pedigree, but the line of those who were not kings. That genealogy, too, he has brought to a point in Nathan the son of David,[fn-10-P1046_413131:7-nf] which person likewise was no king. It is not thus, however, with Matthew. For in tracing the lineage along through Solomon the king,[fn-10-P1047_413281:8-nf] he has pursued with strict regularity the succession of the other kings; and in enumerating these, he has also conserved that mystical number of which we shall speak hereafter.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_12_book_i_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"41.

What similar event could he then have published[fn-54-P5437_1679398:184-nf] of a new deity, whereby he might betoken for \"the holy one\" of the rival god? Simply that he went into the synagogue, and did nothing even in word against the Creator? As therefore he could not by any means acknowledge him, whom he was ignorant of, to be Jesus and the Holy One of God; so did he acknowledge Him whom he knew (to be both). For he remembered how that the prophet had prophesied[fn-54-P5438_1679818:185-nf] of \"the Holy One\" of God, and how that God's name of \"Jesus\" was in the son of Nun.[fn-54-P5439_1679948:186-nf] These facts he had also received[fn-54-P5440_1680049:187-nf] from the angel, according to our Gospel: \"Wherefore that which shall be born of thee shall be called the Holy One, the Son of God; \"[fn-54-P5441_1680200:188-nf] and, \"Thou shalt call his name Jesus.\"[fn-54-P5442_1680290:189-nf] Thus he actually had (although only an evil spirit) some idea of the Lord's dispensation, rather than Of any strange and heretofore imperfectly understood one. Because he also premised this question: \"What have we to do with Thee? \"-not as if referring to a strange Jesus, to whom pertain the evil spirits of the Creator. Nor did he say, What hast Thou to do with us? but, \"What have we to do with Thee? \"as if deploring himself, and deprecating his own calamity; at the prospect of which he adds: \"Art Thou come to destroy us? \"So completely did he acknowledge in Jesus the Son of that God who was judicial and avenging, and (so to speak) severe,[fn-54-P5443_1680958:190-nf] and not of him who was simply good,[fn-54-P5444_1681008:191-nf] and knew not how to destroy or how to punish! Now for what purpose have we adduced his passage first?[fn-54-P5445_1681125:192-nf] In order to show that Jesus was neither acknowledged by the evil spirit, nor affirmed by Himself, to be any other than the Creator's. Well, but Jesus rebuked him, you say. To be sure he did, as being an envious (spirit), and in his very confession only petulant, and evil in adulation-just as if it had been Christ's highest glory to have come for the destruction of demons, and not for the salvation of mankind; whereas His wish really was that His disciples should not glory in the subjection of evil spirits but in the fair beauty of salvation.[fn-54-P5446_1681693:193-nf] Why else[fn-54-P5447_1681745:194-nf] did He rebuke him? If it was because he was entirely wrong (in his invocation), then He was neither Jesus nor the Holy One of God; if it was because he was partially wrong-for having supposed him to be, rightly enough,[fn-54-P5448_1681980:195-nf] Jesus and the Holy One of God, but also as belonging to the Creator-most unjustly would He have rebuked him for thinking what he knew he ought to think (about Him), and for not supposing that of Him which he knew not that he ought to suppose-that he was another Jesus, and the holy one of the other god. If, however, the rebuke has not a more probable meaning[fn-54-P5449_1682356:196-nf] than that which we ascribe to it, follows that the evil spirit made no mistake, and was not rebuked for lying; for it was Jesus Himself, besides whom it was impossible for the evil spirit to have acknowledged any other, whilst Jesus affirmed that He was He whom the evil spirit had acknowledged, by not rebuking him for uttering a lie.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_30_commentary_on_the_apocalypse_of_the_blessed_john","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"ANF-07","text":"7-10. \"The first living creature was like to a lion, and the second was like to a calf, and the third had a face like to a man, and the fourth was like to a flying eagle; and they had six wings, and round about and within they were full of eyes; and they had no rest, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord Omnipotent. And the four and twenty elders, failing down before the throne, adored God.\"] The four and twenty elders arethe twenty-four books of the prophets and of the law, which give testimonies of the judgment. Moreover, also, they are the twenty-four fathers-twelve apostles and twelve patriarchs.And in that the living creatures are different in appearance, this is the reason: the living creature like to a lion designates Mark, in whom is heard the voice of the lion roaring in the desert. And in the figure of a man, Matthew strives to declareto us the genealogy of Mary, from whom Christ took flesh. Therefore, in enumerating from Abraham to David, and thence to Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man: therefore his announcement sets forth the image of a man. Luke, in narrating the priesthood of Zacharias as he offers a sacrifice for the people, and the angel that appears to him with respect of the priesthood, and the victim in the same description bore the likeness of a calf. John the evangelist, like to an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues about the Word of God. Mark, therefore, as an evangelist thus beginning, \"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet; \"[fn-46-P4629_1764220:24-nf] The voice of one crying in the wilderness,\"[fn-46-P4630_1764313:25-nf] -has the effigy of a lion. And Matthew, \"The hook of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: \"[fn-46-P4631_1764455:26-nf] this is the form of a man. But Luke said, \"There was a priest, by name Zachariah, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron: \"[fn-46-P4632_1764623:27-nf] this is the likeness of a calf. But John, when he begins, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,\"[fn-46-P4633_1764779:28-nf] sets forth the likeness of a flying eagle. Moreover, not only do the evangelists express their four similitudes in their respective openings of the Gospels, but also the Word itself of God the Father Omnipotent, which is His Son our Lord Jesus Christ, bears the same likeness in the time of His advent. When He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion and a lion's whelp. And when for man's salvation He was made man to overcome death, and to set all men free, and that He offered Himself a victim to the Father on our behalf, He was called a calf. And that He overcame death and ascended into the heavens, extending His wings and protecting His people, He was named a flying eagle. Therefore these announcements, although they are four, yet are one, because it proceeded from one mouth. Even as the river in paradise, although it is one, was divided into four heads. Moreover, that for the announcement of the New Testament those bring creatures had eyes within and without, shows the spiritual providence which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and beholds the things which are coming after that are within and without.","title":"Commentary on the Apocalypse of the Blessed John","author":"Victorinus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":62,"source_paragraph":"186","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"As I said, however, let him entertain what views he likes of this lust; let him proclaim it as he pleases, praise it as much as he chooses (and he pleases much, as several of his extracts show), that the Pelagians may gratify themselves, if not with its uses, at all events with its praises, as many of them as fail to enjoy the limitation of continence enjoined in wedlock.

The evangelist Matthew has commenced his narrative in these terms: \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\"[fn-13-P1347_539687:1-nf] By this exordium he shows with sufficient clearness that his undertaking is to give an account of the generation of Christ according to the flesh. For, according to this, Christ is the Son of man, - a title which He also gives very frequently to Himself,[fn-13-P1348_539957:2-nf] thereby commending to our notice what in His compassion He has condescended to be on our behalf. For that heavenly and eternal generation, in virtue of which He is the only-begotten Son of God, before every creature, because all things were made by Him, is so ineffable, that it is of it that the word of the prophet must be understood when he says, \"Who shall declare His generation?\"[fn-13-P1349_540369:3-nf] Matthew therefore traces out the human generation of Christ, mentioning His ancestors from Abraham downwards, and carrying them on to Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born. For it was not held allowable to consider him dissociated from the married estate which was entered into with Mary, on the ground that she gave birth to Christ, not as the wedded wife of Joseph, but as a virgin. For by this example an illustrious recommendation is made to faithful married persons of the principle, that even when by common consent they maintain their continence, the relation can still remain, and can still be called one of wedlock, inasmuch as, although there is no connection between the sexes of the body, there is the keeping of the affections of the mind; particularly so for this reason, that in their case we see how the birth of a son was a possibility apart from anything of that carnal intercourse which is to be practised with the purpose of the procreation of children only. Moreover, the mere fact that he had not begotten Him by act of his own, was no sufficient reason why Joseph should not be called the father of Christ; for indeed he could be in all propriety the father of one whom he had not begotten by his own wife, but had adopted from some other person.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5. Furthermore, as to those critics who find a difficulty in the circumstance that Matthew enumerates one series of ancestors, beginning With David and travelling downwards to Joseph,[fn-13-P1365_545684:12-nf] while Luke specifies a different succession, tracing it from Joseph upwards as far as to David,[fn-13-P1366_545800:13-nf] they might easily perceive that Joseph may have had two fathers,-namely, one by whom he was begotten, and a second by whom he may have been adopted.[fn-13-P1367_545971:14-nf] For it was an ancient custom also among that people to adopt children with the view of making sons for themselves of those whom they had not begotten. For, leaving out of sight the fact that Pharaoh's daughter[fn-13-P1368_547253:15-nf] adopted Moses (as she was a foreigner), Jacob himself adopted his own grandsons, the sons of Joseph, in these very intelligible terms: \"Now, therefore, thy two sons which were born unto thee before I came unto thee, are mine: Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon: and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine.\"[fn-13-P1369_547618:16-nf] Whence also it came to pass that there were twelve tribes of Israel, although the tribe of Levi was omitted, which did service in the temple; for along with that one the whole number was thirteen, the sons of Jacob themselves being twelve. Thus, too, we can understand how Luke, in the genealogy contained in his Gospel, has named a father for Joseph, not in the person of the father by whom he was begotten, but in that of the father by whom he was adopted, tracing the list of the progenitors upwards until David is reached. For, seeing that there is a necessity, as both evangelists give a true narrative,-to wit, both Matthew and Luke,-that one of them should hold by the line of the father who begat Joseph, and the other by the line of the father who adopted him, whom should we suppose more likely to have preserved the lineage of the adopting father, than that evangelist who has declined to speak of Joseph as begotten by the person whose son he has nevertheless reported him to be? For it is more appropriate that one should have been called the son of the man by whom he was adopted, than that he should be said to have been begotten by the man of whose flesh he was not descended. Now when Matthew, accordingly, used the phrases, \"Abraham begat Isaac,\" \"Isaac begat Jacob,\" and so on, keeping steadily by the term \"begat,\" until he said at the close, \"and Jacob begat Joseph,\" he gave us to know with sufficient clearness, that he had traced out the order[fn-13-P1370_549110:17-nf] of ancestors on to that father by whom Joseph was not adopted, but begotten.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"10. In this way, then, as Matthew undertook the task of presenting the record of Christ as the King who came into this world, and into this earthly and mortal life of men, for the purpose of exercising rule over us who have to struggle with temptation, he began with Abraham, and enumerated forty men. For Christ came in the flesh from that very nation of the Hebrews with a view to the keeping of which as a people distinct from the other nations, God separated Abraham from his own country and his own kindred.[fn-13-P1396_558965:36-nf] And the circumstance that the promise contained an intimation of the race from which He was destined to come, served very specially to make the prediction and announcement concerning Him something all the clearer. Thus the evangelist did indeed mark out fourteen generations in each of three several members, stating that from Abraham until David there were fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away into Babylon other fourteen generations, and another fourteen from that period on to the nativity of Christ.[fn-13-P1397_559514:37-nf] But he did not then reckon them all up in one sum, counting them one by one, and saying that thus they make up forty-two in all. For among these progenitors there is one who is enumerated twice, namely Jechonias, with whom a kind of deflection was made in the direction of extraneous nations at the time when the transmigration into Babylon took place.[fn-13-P1398_559884:38-nf] When the enumeration, moreover, is thus bent from the direct order of progression, and is made to form, if we may so say, a kind of corner for the purpose of taking a different course, what meets us at that corner is mentioned twice over,-namely, at the close of the preceding series, and at the head of the deflection specified. And this, too, was a figure of Christ as the one who was, in a certain sense, to pass from the circumcision to the uncircumcision, or, so to speak, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and to be, as it were, the corner-stone to all who believe on Him, whether on the one side or on the other. Thus was God making preparations then in a figurative manner for things which were to come in truth. For Jechonias himself, with whose name the kind of corner which I have in view was prefigured, is by interpretation the \"preparation of God.\"[fn-13-P1399_561117:39-nf] In this way, therefore, there are really not forty-two distinct generations named here, which would be the proper sum of three times fourteen; but, as there is a double enumeration of one of the names, we have here forty generations in all, taking into account the fact that Christ Himself is reckoned in the number, who, like the kingly president over this [significant] number forty, superintends the administration of this temporal and earthly life of ours.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"14.

Such then, as we have above described, is the madness and daring of those men. But our faith is right, and starts from the teaching of the Apostles and tradition of the fathers, being confirmed both by the New Testament and the Old. For the Prophets say: `Send out Thy Word and Thy Truth[fn-101-P10110_3620532:26-nf] ,' and `Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is being interpreted God with us[fn-101-P10111_3620686:27-nf] .' But what does that mean, if not that God has come in the Flesh? While the Apostolic tradition teaches in the words of blessed Peter, `Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the Flesh;' and in what Paul writes, `Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a people for His own possession, and zealous of good works[fn-101-P10112_3621177:28-nf] .'

Hence also we always give thanks in the name of Jesus Christ, and we do not set at nought the grace which came to us through Him. For the coming of the Saviour in the flesh has been the ransom and salvation of all creation. So then, beloved and most longed-for, let what I have said put in mind those who love the Lord, while as to those who have imitated the behaviour of Judas, and deserted the Lord to join Caiaphas, let them by these things be taught better, if maybe they are willing, if maybe they are ashamed.

But this just man has no wish to keep her, and so does not love in any carnal sort; and yet he does not wish to punish her; and so in his mercy he spares her. How truly just a man is this! He would neither keep an adulteress, lest he should seem to spare her because of an impure affection, and yet he would not punish or betray her.

These four are, as it were, the elements of the faith of the Church, out of which elements the whole world which is reconciled to God in Christ is put together; as Paul says,[fn-61-P6133_937094:23-nf] \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself; \"of which world Jesus bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is written,[fn-61-P6134_937266:24-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" The Gospels then being four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you[fn-61-P6135_937437:25-nf] have enjoined me to search into according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of Abraham and of David, says:[fn-61-P6136_937786:26-nf] \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\" And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, God the Word. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, \"The former treatise did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,\" yet leaves to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, \"I am the light of the world,\" \"I am the way and the truth and the life,\" \"I am the resurrection, \"I am the door,\" \"I am the good shepherd; \"and in the Apocalypse, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\" We may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are the first fruits of all the Scriptures, but that of the Gospels that of John is the first fruits. No one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus' breast and received from Jesus Mary to be his mother also. Such an one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, \"Woman, behold thy son,\"[fn-61-P6137_939156:27-nf] and not \"Behold you have this son also,\" then He virtually said to her, \"Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.\" Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer,[fn-61-P6138_939364:28-nf] but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, \"Behold thy son Christ.\" What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears? What shall we say of this work? He who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be able to say with truth,[fn-61-P6139_939891:29-nf] \"We have the mind of Christ, that we may know those things which are bestowed on us by God.\" It is possible to quote one of Paul's sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel. He writes in a certain place:[fn-61-P6140_940160:30-nf] \"According to my Gospel.\" Now we have no written work of Paul which is commonly called a Gospel. But all that he preached and said was the Gospel; and what he preached and said he was also in the habit of writing, and what he wrote was therefore Gospel. But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ's sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present reality in those souls which were willing to receive the Word of God as He stood at the door and knocked and sought to come into them.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But, leaving Alexander with his syllogisms, which he so perversely applies in his discussions, as well as with the hymns of Valentinus, which, with consummate assurance, he interpolates as the production of some respectable[fn-95-P9533_2615895:242-nf] author, let us confine our inquiry to a single point-Whether Christ received flesh from the virgin?-that we may thus arrive at a certain proof that His flesh was human, if He derived its substance from His mother's womb, although we are at once furnished with clear evidences of the human character of His flesh, from its name and description as that of a man, and from the nature of its constitution, and from the system of its sensations, and from its suffering of death. Now, it will first by necessary to show what previous reason there was for the Son of God's being born of a virgin. He who was going to consecrate a new order of birth, must Himself be born after a novel fashion, concerning which Isaiah foretold how that the Lord Himself would give the sign. What, then, is the sign? \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\"[fn-95-P9534_2616751:243-nf] Accordingly, a virgin did conceive and bear \"Emmanuel, God with us.\"[fn-95-P9535_2616841:244-nf] This is the new nativity; a man is born in God. And in this man God was born, taking the flesh of an ancient race, without the help, however, of the ancient seed, in order that He might reform it with a new seed, that is, in a spiritual manner, and cleanse it by the re-moral of all its ancient stains. But the whole of this new birth was prefigured, as was the case in all other instances, in ancient type, the Lord being born as man by a dispensation in which a virgin was the medium. The earth was still in a virgin state, reduced as yet by no human labour, with no seed as yet cast into its furrows, when, as we are told, God made man out of it into a living soul.[fn-95-P9536_2617530:245-nf] As, then, the first Adam is thus introduced to us, it is a just inference that the second Adam likewise, as the apostle has told us, was formed by God into a quickening spirit out of the ground,-in other words, out of a flesh which was unstained as yet by any human generation. But that I may lose no opportunity of supporting my argument from the name of Adam, why is Christ called Adam by the apostle, unless it be that, as man, He was of that earthly origin? And even reason here maintains the same conclusion, because it was by just the contrary[fn-95-P9537_2618099:246-nf] operation that God recovered His own image and likeness, of which He had been robbed by the devil. For it was while Eve was yet a virgin, that the ensnaring word had crept into her ear which was to build the edifice of death. Into a virgin's soul, in like manner, must be introduced that Word of God which was to raise the fabric of life; so that what had been reduced to ruin by this sex, might by the selfsame sex be recovered to salvation. As Eve had believed the serpent, so Mary believed the angel.[fn-95-P9538_2618618:247-nf] The delinquency which the one occasioned by believing, the other by believing effaced. But (it will be said) Eve did not at the devil's word conceive in her womb. Well, she at all events conceived; for the devil's word afterwards became as seed to her that she should conceive as an outcast, and bring forth in sorrow. Indeed she gave birth to a fratricidal devil; whilst Mary, on the contrary, bare one who was one day to secure salvation to Israel, His own brother after the flesh, and the murderer of Himself. God therefore sent down into the virgin's womb His Word, as the good Brother, who should blot out the memory of the evil brother. Hence it was necessary that Christ should come forth for the salvation of man, in that condition of flesh into which man had entered ever since his condemnation.

Now let us carefully attend to the sense of these passages. \"Thou didst draw me,\" He says, \"out of the womb.\" Now what is it which is drawn, if it be not that which adheres, that which is firmly fastened to anything from which it is drawn in order to be sundered? If He clove not to the womb, how could He have been drawn from it? If He who clove thereto was drawn from it, how could He have adhered to it, if it were not that, all the while He was in the womb, He was tied to it, as to His origin,[fn-95-P9585_2630534:285-nf] by the umbilical cord, which communicated growth to Him from the matrix? Even when one strange matter amalgamates with another, it becomes so entirely incorporated[fn-95-P9586_2630724:286-nf] with that with which it amalgamates, that when it is drawn off from it, it carries with it some part of the body from which it is torn, as if in consequence of the severance of the union and growth which the constituent pieces had communicated to each other. But what were His \"mother's breasts\" which He mentions? No doubt they were those which He sucked. Midwives, and doctors, and naturalists, can tell us, from the nature of women's breasts, whether they usually flow at any other time than when the womb is affected with pregnancy, when the veins convey therefrom the blood of the lower parts[fn-95-P9587_2631401:287-nf] to the mammilla, and in the act of transference convert the secretion into the nutritious[fn-95-P9588_2631532:288-nf] substance of milk. Whence it comes to pass that during the period of lactation the monthly issues are suspended. But if the Word was made flesh of Himself without any communication with a womb, no mother's womb operating upon Him with its usual function and support, how could the lacteal fountain have been conveyed (from the womb) to the breasts, since (the womb) can only effect the change by actual possession of the proper substance? But it could not possibly have had blood for transformation into milk, unless it possessed the causes of blood also, that is to say, the severance (by birth)[fn-95-P9589_2632147:289-nf] of its own flesh from the mother's womb.

They, deny to the fruit its blossom, and to the blossom its stem, and to the stem its root; so that the root fails to secure[fn-96-P9605_2636111:302-nf] for itself, by means of the stem, that special product which comes from the stem, even the blossom and the fruit; for every step indeed in a genealogy is traced from the latest up to the first, so that it is now a well-known fact that the flesh of Christ is inseparable,[fn-96-P9606_2636408:303-nf] not merely from Mary, but also from David through Mary, and from Jesse through David. \"This fruit,\" therefore, \"of David's loins,\" that is to say, of his posterity in the flesh, God swears to him that \"He will raise up to sit upon his throne.\"[fn-96-P9607_2636670:304-nf] If \"of David's loins,\" how much rather is He of Mary's loins, by virtue of whom He is in \"the loins of David? \"","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"ANF-03","text":"They may, then, obliterate the testimony of the devils which proclaimed Jesus the son of David; but whatever unworthiness there be in this testimony, that of the apostles they will never be able to efface, There is, first of all, Matthew, that most faithful chronicler[fn-96-P9611_2637295:305-nf] of the Gospel, because the companion of the Lord; for no other reason in the world than to show us clearly the fleshly original[fn-96-P9612_2637443:306-nf] of Christ, he thus begins his Gospel: \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\"[fn-96-P9613_2637622:307-nf] With a nature issuing from such fountal sources, and an order gradually descending to the birth of Christ, what else have we here described than the very flesh of Abraham and of David conveying itself down, step after step, to the very virgin, and at last introducing Christ,-nay, producing Christ Himself of the virgin? Then, again, there is Paul, who was at once both a disciple, and a master, and a witness of the selfsame Gospel; as an apostle of the same Christ, also, he affirms that Christ \"was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh,\"[fn-96-P9614_2638195:308-nf] -which, therefore, was His own likewise. Christ's flesh, then, is of David's seed. Since He is of the seed of David in consequence of Mary's flesh, He is therefore of Mary's flesh because of the seed of David. In what way so ever you torture the statement, He is either of the flesh of Mary because of the seed of David, or He is of the seed of David because of the flesh of Mary. The whole discussion is terminated by the same apostle, when he declares Christ to be \"the seed of Abraham.\" And if of Abraham, how much more, to be sure, of David, as a more recent progenitor! For, unfolding the promised blessing upon all nations in the person[fn-96-P9615_2638870:309-nf] of Abraham, \"And in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed,\" he adds, \"He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.\"[fn-96-P9616_2639084:310-nf] When we read and believe these things, what sort of flesh ought we, and can we, acknowledge in Christ?

This we prove from the writings of the evangelists and apostles, so that no one can reject our proofs without also rejecting these writings. Faustus' plan is to represent some one as saying a few words, without bringing forward any evidence in answer to Faustus' fertile sophistry. But with all his ingenuity, the proofs I have to give will leave Faustus no reply, but that these passages are spurious interpolations in the sacred record,-a reply which serves as a means of escaping, or of trying to escape, the force of the plainest statements in Holy Scripture. We have already in this treatise sufficiently exposed the irrational absurdity, as well as the daring profanity, of such criticism; and not to exceed all limits, we must avoid repetition. It cannot be necessary that we should bring together all the passages scattered throughout Scripture, which show, in answer to Faustus, that in the books of the highest and most sacred authority He who is called the only-begotten Son of God, even God with God, is also called the Son of David, on account of His taking the form of a servant from the Virgin Mary, the wife of Joseph. To instance only Matthew, since Faustus' argument refers to this Gospel, as the whole book cannot be quoted here, let whoever choose read it, and see how Matthew carries on to the passion and the resurrection the narrative of Him whom He calls the Son of David in the introduction to the genealogy. Of this same Son of David he speaks as being conceived and born of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Ghost. He also applies to this the declaration of the prophet, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is being interpreted, God with us.\"[fn-23-P2322_1404272:6-nf] Again, He who was called, even from the Virgin's womb, God-with-us, is said to have heard, when He was baptized by John, a voice from heaven, saying, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\"[fn-23-P2323_1404510:7-nf] Will Faustus say that to be called God is less than to be called the Son of God? He seems to think so, for he tries to prove that because this voice came from heaven at the time of the baptism, therefore, according to Matthew, He must then have become the Son of God; whereas the same evangelist, in a previous passage, quotes the sacred announcement made by the prophet, in which the child horn of the Virgin is called God-with-us.","title":"Book XXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, to upset all conceits of this sort, let me dispel at once the preliminary idea on which they rest-their assertion that the prophets make all their announcements in figures of speech.

For, confuted on all sides on the distinction between the Father and the Son, which we maintain without destroying their inseparable union-as (by the examples) of the sun and the ray, and the fountain and the river-yet, by help of (their conceit)an indivisible number, (with issues)of two and three, they endeavour to interpret this distinction in a way which shall nevertheless tally with their own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish two, Father and Son, understanding the Son to be flesh, that is man, that is Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is God, that is Christ. Thus they, while contending that the Father and the Son are one and the same, do in fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them. For if Jesus is one, and Christ is another, then the Son will be different from the Father, because the Son is Jesus, and the Father is Christ. Such a monarchy as this they learnt, I suppose, in the school of Valentinus, making two-Jesus and Christ. But this conception of theirs has been, in fact, already confuted in what we have previously advanced, because the Word of God or the Spirit of God is also called the power of the Highest, whom they make the Father; whereas these relations[fn-108-P10842_3040974:384-nf] are not themselves the same as He whose relations they are said to be, but they proceed from Him and appertain to Him. However, another refutation awaits them on this point of their heresy. See, say they, it was announced by the angel: \"Therefore that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10843_3041312:385-nf] Therefore, (they argue, ) as it was the flesh that was born, it must be the flesh that is the Son of God. Nay, (I answer, ) this is spoken concerning the Spirit of God. For it was certainly of the Holy Spirit that the virgin conceived; and that which He conceived, she brought forth. That, therefore, had to be born which was conceived and was to be brought forth; that is to say, the Spirit, whose \"name should be called Emmanuel which, being interpreted, is, God with us.\"[fn-108-P10844_3041806:386-nf] Besides, the flesh is not God, so that it could not have been said concerning it, \"That Holy Thing shall be called the Son of God,\" but only that Divine Being who was born in the flesh, of whom the psalm also says, \"Since God became man in the midst of it, and established it by the will of the Father.\"[fn-108-P10845_3042130:387-nf] Now what Divine Person was born in it? The Word, and the Spirit which became incarnate with the Word by the will of the Father. The Word, therefore, is incarnate; and this must be the point of our inquiry: How the Word became flesh,-whether it was by having been transfigured, as it were, in the flesh, or by having really clothed Himself in flesh. Certainly it was by a real clothing of Himself in flesh. For the rest, we must needs believe God to be unchangeable, and incapable of form, as being eternal. But transfiguration is the destruction of that which previously existed. For whatsoever is transfigured into some other thing ceases to be that which it had been, and begins to be that which it previously was not. God, however, neither ceases to be what He was, nor can He be any other thing than what He is. The Word is God, and \"the Word of the Lord remaineth for ever,\"-even by holding on unchangeably in His own proper form. Now, if He admits not of being transfigured, it must follow that He be understood in this sense to have become flesh, when He comes to be in the flesh, and is manifested, and is seen, and is handled by means of the flesh; since all the other points likewise require to be thus understood. For if the Word became flesh by a transfiguration and change of substance, it follows at once that Jesus must be a substance compounded of[fn-108-P10846_3043533:388-nf] two substances-of flesh and spirit,-a kind of mixture, like electrum, composed of gold and silver; and it begins to be neither gold (that is to say, spirit) nor silver (that is to say, flesh),-the one being changed by the other, and a third substance produced. Jesus, therefore, cannot at this rate be God for He has ceased to be the Word, which was made flesh; nor can He be Man incarnate for He is not properly flesh, and it was flesh which the Word became. Being compounded, therefore, of both, He actually is neither; He is rather some third substance, very different from either. But the truth is, we find that He is expressly set forth as both God and Man; the very psalm which we have quoted intimating (of the flesh), that \"God became Man in the midst of it, He therefore established it by the will of the Father,\"-certainly in all respects as the Son of God and the Son of Man, being God and Man, differing no doubt according to each substance in its own especial property, inasmuch as the Word is nothing else but God, and the flesh nothing else but Man. Thus does the apostle also teach respecting His two substances, saying, \"who was made of the seed of David; \"[fn-108-P10847_3044719:389-nf] in which words He will be Man and Son of Man. \"Who was declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit; \"[fn-108-P10848_3044850:390-nf] in which words He will be God, and the Word-the Son of God. We see plainly the twofold state, which is not confounded, but conjoined in One Person-Jesus, God and Man. Concerning Christ, indeed, I defer what I have to say.[fn-108-P10849_3045087:391-nf] (I remark here), that the property of each nature is so wholly preserved, that the Spirit[fn-108-P10850_3045202:392-nf] on the one hand did all things in Jesus suitable to Itself, such as miracles, and mighty deeds, and wonders; and the Flesh, on the other hand, exhibited the affections which belong to it. It was hungry under the devil's temptation, thirsty with the Samaritan woman, wept over Lazarus, was troubled even unto death, and at last actually died. If, however, it was only a tertium quid, some composite essence formed out of the Two substances, like the electrum (which we have mentioned), there would be no distinct proofs apparent of either nature. But by a transfer of functions, the Spirit would have done things to be done by the Flesh, and the Flesh such as are effected by the Spirit; or else such things as are suited neither to the Flesh nor to the Spirit, but confusedly of some third character. Nay more, on this supposition, either the Word underwent death, or the flesh did not die, if so be the Word was converted into flesh; because either the flesh was immortal, or the Word was modal. Forasmuch, however, as the two substances acted distinctly, each in its own character, there necessarily accrued to them severally their own operations, and their own issues. Learn then, together with Nicodemus, that \"that which is born in the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.\"[fn-108-P10851_3046545:393-nf] Neither the flesh becomes Spirit, nor the Spirit flesh. In one Person they no doubt are well able to be co-existent. Of them Jesus consists-Man. of the flesh; of the Spirit, God-and the angel designated Him as \"the Son of God,\"[fn-108-P10852_3046793:394-nf] in respect of that nature, in which He was Spirit, reserving for the flesh the appellation \"Son of Man.\" In like manner, again, the apostle calls Him \"the Mediator between God and Men,\"[fn-108-P10853_3046998:395-nf] and so affirmed His participation of both substances. Now, to end the matter, will you, who interpret the Son of God to be flesh, be so good as as to show us what the Son of Man is? Will He then, I want to know, be the Spirit? But you insist upon it that the Father Himself is the Spirit, on the ground that \"God is a Spirit,\" just as if we did not read also that there is \"the Spirit of God; \"in the same manner as we find that as \"the Word was God,\" so also there is \"the Word of God.\"","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_42_book_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"3. But if we are to end the controversy by saying this, why do not our opponents themselves say it? While they assert the death of Christ to have been not real but feigned, why do they make out that He had no birth at all, not even of the same kind as His death? If they had so much regard for the authority of the evangelist as to oblige them to admit that Christ suffered, at least in appearance, it is the same authority which testifies to His birth. Two evangelists, indeed, give the story of the birth;[fn-24-P2422_1466941:2-nf] but in all we read of Jesus having a mother.[fn-24-P2423_1467014:3-nf] Perhaps Faustus was unwilling to make the birth an illusion, because the difference of the genealogies given in Matthew and Luke causes an apparent discrepancy.

For they will have it that the self-same that is man, the Son of man, appears also as the Son of God; that man and flesh and that same frail substance may be said to be also the Son of God Himself. Whence, since no distinction is discerned between the Son of man and the Son of God, but the Son of man Himself is asserted to be the Son of God, the same Christ and the Son of God is asserted to be man only; by which they strive to exclude, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\"[fn-103-P10349_3252679:186-nf] And ye shall call His name Emmanuel; which is, interpreted, God with us.\"[fn-103-P10350_3252773:187-nf] For they propose and put forward what is told in the Gospel of Luke, whence they strive to maintain not what is the truth, but only what they want it to be: \"The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shah overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing which is born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-103-P10351_3253126:188-nf] If, then, say they, the angel of God says to Mary, \"that Holy Thing which is born of thee,\" the substance of flesh and body is of Mary; but he has set forth that this substance, that is, that Holy Thing which is born of her, is the Son of God. Man, say they, himself, and that bodily flesh; that which is called holy, itself is the Son of God. That also when the Scripture says that \"Holy Thing,\" we should understand thereby Christ the man, the Son of man; and when it places before us the Son of God, we ought to perceive, not man, but God. And yet the divine Scripture easily convicts and discloses the frauds and artifices of the heretics. For if it were thus only, \"The Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore that Holy Thing which is born of thee shall be called the Son of God,\" perchance we should have had to strive against them in another sort, and to have sought for other arguments, and to have taken up other weapons, with which to overcome both their snares and their wiles; but since the Scripture itself, abounding in heavenly fulness, divests itself of the calumnies of these heretics, we easily depend upon that that is written, and overcome those errors without any hesitation. For it said, not as we have already stated, \"Therefore the Holy Thing which shall be born of thee; \"but added the conjunction, for it says, \"Therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee,\" so as to make it plain that that Holy Thing which is born of her-that is, that substance of flesh and body-is not the Son of God primarily, but consequently, and in the secondary place;[fn-103-P10352_3254782:189-nf] but primarily, that the Son of God is the Word of God, incarnate by that Spirit of whom the angel says, \"The Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\" For He is the legitimate Son of God who is of God Himself; and He, while He assumes that Holy Thing, and links to Himself the Son of man, and draws Him and transfers Him to Himself, by His connection and mingling of association becomes responsible for and makes Him the Son of God, which by nature He was not, so that the original cause[fn-103-P10353_3255523:190-nf] of that name Son of God is in the Spirit of the Lord, who descended and came, and that there is only the continuance of the name in the case of the Son of man;[fn-103-P10354_3255706:191-nf] and by consequence He reasonably became the Son of God, although originally He is not the Son of God. And therefore the angel, seeing that arrangement, and providing for that order of the mystery, did not confuse every thing in such a way as to leave no trace of a distinction, but established the distinction by saying, \"Therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God; \"lest, had he not arranged that distribution with his balances, but had left the matter all mixed up in confusion, it had really afforded occasion to heretics to declare that the Son of man, in that He is man, is the same as the Son of God and man. But now, explaining severally the ordinance and the reason of so great a mystery, he evidently set forth in saying, \"And that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God; \"the proof that the Son of God descended, and that He, in taking up into Himself the Son of man, consequently made Him the Son of God, because the Son of God associated and joined Him to Himself. So that, while the Son of man cleaves in His nativity to the Son of God, by that very mingling He holds that as pledged and derived which of His own nature He could not possess. And thus by the word of the angel the distinction is made, against the desire of the heretics, between the Son of God and man; yet with their association, by pressing them to understand that Christ the Son of man is man, and also to receive the Son of God and man the Son of God; that is, the Word of God as it is written as God; and thus to acknowledge that Christ Jesus the Lord, connected on both sides, so to speak, is on both sides woven in and grown together, and associated in the same agreement of both substances, by the binding to one another of a mutual alliance-man and God by the truth of the Scripture which declares this very thing.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"146","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But it was, as the prophets also predicted, from a virgin that there was to be born, according to the promised sign, one who was to give His name to the fact, showing that at His birth God was to be with man. Now it seems to me appropriate to the character of a Jew to have quoted the prophecy of Isaiah, which says that Immanuel was to be born of a virgin. This, however, Celsus, who professes to know everything, has not done, either from ignorance or from an unwillingness (if he had read it and voluntarily passed it by in silence) to furnish an argument which might defeat his purpose. And the prediction runs thus: \"And the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth or in the height above· But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.\"[fn-77-P7796_1852192:55-nf] And that it was from intentional malice that Celsus did not quote this prophecy, is clear to me from this, that although he makes numerous quotations from the Gospel according to Matthew, as of the star that appeared at the birth of Christ, and other miraculous occurrences, he has made no mention at all of this. Now, if a Jew should split words, and say that the words are not, \"Lo, a virgin,\" but, \"Lo, a young woman,\"[fn-77-P7797_1852657:56-nf] we reply that the word \"Olmah\"-which the Septuagint have rendered by \"a virgin,\" and others by \"a young woman\"-occurs, as they say, in Deuteronomy, as applied to a \"virgin,\" in the following connection: \"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,[fn-77-P7798_1853108:57-nf] because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he humbled his neighbour's wife.\"[fn-77-P7799_1853218:58-nf] And again: \"But if a man find a betrothed damsel in a field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: but unto the damsel[fn-78-P7800_1853416:59-nf] ye shall do nothing; there is in her no sin worthy of death.\"","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":67,"source_paragraph":"210","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And in addition to the above, this Jew of Celsus afterwards addresses Jesus: \"What need, moreover, was there that you, while still an infant, should be conveyed into Egygt?

And was not the great God, who had already sent two angels on your account, able to keep you, His only Son, there in safety? \"From these words Celsus seems to think that there was no element of divinity in the human body and soul of Jesus, but that His body was not even such as is described in the fables of Homer; and with a taunt also at the blood of Jesus which was shed upon the cross, he adds that it was not\"Ichor, such as flows in the veins of the blessed gods.\"[fn-79-P7967_1932480:130-nf] We now, believing Jesus Himself, when He says respecting His divinity, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life,\"[fn-79-P7968_1932622:131-nf] and employs other terms of similar import; and when He says respecting His being clothed with a human body, \"And now ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth,\"[fn-79-P7969_1932816:132-nf] conclude that He was a kind of compound being. And so it became Him who was making provision for His sojourning in the world as a human being, not to expose Himself unseasonably to the danger of death. And in like manner it was necessary that He should be taken away by His parents, acting under the instructions of an angel from heaven, who communicated to them the divine will, saying on the first occasion, \"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost; \"[fn-79-P7970_1933381:133-nf] and on the second, \"Arise, and take the young Child, and His mother, and flee into Egypt; and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.\"[fn-79-P7971_1933591:134-nf] Now, what is recorded in these words appears to me to be not at all marvellous. For in either passage of Scripture it is stated that it was in a dream that the angel spoke these words; and that in a dream certain persons may have certain things pointed out to them to do, is an event of frequent occurrence to many individuals,-the impression on the mind being produced either by an angel or by some other thing. Where, then, is the absurdity in believing that He who had once become incarnate, should be led also by human guidance to keep out of the way of dangers? Not indeed from any impossibility that it should be otherwise, but from the moral fitness that ways and means should be made use of to ensure the safety of Jesus. And it was certainly better that the Child Jesus should escape the snare of Herod, and should reside with His parents in Egypt until the death of the conspirator, than that Divine Providence should hinder the free-will of Herod in his wish to put the Child to death, or that the fabled poetic helmet of Hades should have been employed, or anything of a similar kind done with respect to Jesus, or that they who came to destroy Him should have been smitten with blindness like the people of Sodom. For the sending of help to Him in a very miraculous and unnecessarily public manner, would not have been of any service to Him who, wished to show that as a man, to whom witness was borne by God, He possessed within that form which was seen by the eyes of men some higher element of divinity,-that which was properly the Son of God-God the Word-the power of God, and the wisdom of God-He who is called the Christ. But this is not a suitable occasion for discussing the composite nature of the incarnate Jesus; the investigation into such a subject being for believers, so to speak, a sort of private question.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"252","folder":"ANF-02","text":"And in the Gospel according to Matthew, the genealogy which begins with Abraham is continued down to Mary the mother of the Lord. \"For,\" it is said,[fn-53-P5373_1638620:298-nf] \"from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon till Christ are likewise other fourteen generations,\"-three mystic intervals completed in six weeks.[fn-53-P5374_1638905:299-nf] ","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_14_tractate_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"6.

Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy seat.\"[fn-74-P7419_1985302:73-nf] And again: \"In Judea is God known; His place has been made in peace, and His dwelling in Zion.\"[fn-74-P7420_1985419:74-nf] Therefore there is one and the same God, who was proclaimed by the prophets and announced by the Gospel; and His Son, who was of the fruit of David's body, that is, of the virgin of [the house of] David, and Emmanuel; whose star also Balaam thus prophesied: \"There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a leader shall rise in Israel.\"[fn-74-P7421_1985772:75-nf] But Matthew says that the Magi, coming from the east, exclaimed \"For we have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him; \"[fn-74-P7422_1985927:76-nf] and that, having been led by the star into the house of Jacob to Emmanuel, they showed, by these gifts which they offered, who it was that was worshipped; myrrh, because it was He who should die and be buried for the mortal human met; gold, because He was a King, \"of whose kingdom is no end; \"[fn-74-P7423_1986240:77-nf] and frankincense, because He was God, who also \"was made known in Judea,\"[fn-74-P7424_1986331:78-nf] and was \"declared to those who sought Him not.\"[fn-74-P7425_1986398:79-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-01","text":"8. It is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds,[fn-75-P7506_2015609:142-nf] while the Church is scattered throughout all the world, and the \"pillar and ground\"[fn-75-P7507_2015809:143-nf] of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh. From which fact, it is evident that the Word, the Artificer of all, He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains all things, He who was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but bound together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His manifestation, \"Thou that sittest between the cherubim, shine forth.\"[fn-75-P7508_2016346:144-nf] For the cherubim, too, were four-faced, and their faces were images of the dispensation of the Son of God. For, [as the Scripture] says, \"The first living creature was like a lion,\"[fn-75-P7509_2016548:145-nf] symbolizing His effectual working, His leadership, and royal power; the second [living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His] sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but \"the third had, as it were, the face as of a man,\"-an evident description of His advent as a human being; \"the fourth was like a flying eagle,\" pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering with His wings over the Church. And therefore the Gospels are in accord with these things, among which Christ Jesus is seated. For that according to John relates His original, effectual, and glorious generation from the Father, thus declaring, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-75-P7510_2017251:146-nf] Also, \"all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\" For this reason, too, is that Gospel full of all confidence, for such is His person.[fn-75-P7511_2017425:147-nf] But that according to Luke, taking up [His] priestly character, commenced with Zacharias the priest offering sacrifice to God. For now was made ready the fatted calf, about to be immolated for[fn-75-P7512_2017749:148-nf] the finding again of the younger son. Matthew, again, relates His generation as a man, saying, \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham; \"[fn-75-P7513_2017973:149-nf] and also, \"The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.\" This, then, is the Gospel of His humanity;[fn-75-P7514_2018095:150-nf] for which reason it is, too, that [the character of] a humble and meek man is kept up through the whole Gospel. Mark, on the other hand, commences with [a reference to] the prophetical spirit coming down from on high to men, saying, \"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Esaias the prophet,\"-pointing to the winged aspect of the Gospel; and on this account he made a compendious and cursory narrative, for such is the prophetical character. And the Word of God Himself used to converse with the ante-Mosaic patriarchs, in accordance with His divinity and glory; but for those under the law he instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical service.[fn-75-P7515_2018868:151-nf] Afterwards, being made man for us, He sent the gift of the celestial Spirit over all the earth, protecting us with His wings. Such, then, as was the course followed by the Son of God, so was also the form of the living creatures; and such as was the form of the living creatures, so was also the character of the Gospel.[fn-75-P7516_2019471:152-nf] For the living creatures are quadriform, and the Gospel is quadriform, as is also the course followed by the Lord. For this reason were four principal (kaqolikai/) covenants given to the human race:[fn-75-P7517_2019777:153-nf] one, prior to the deluge, under Adam; the second, that after the deluge, under Noah; the third, the giving of the law, under Moses; the fourth, that which renovates man, and sums up all things in itself by means of the Gospel, raising and bearing men upon heavenly kingdom.its wings into the","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

For if thou only know that he hath sinned against thee, and thou wouldest \"rebuke him before all,\" thou art not a reprover, but a betrayer. Consider how that \"just man\" Joseph spared his wife with such exceeding kindness, in so great a crime as he had suspected her of, before he knew by whom she had conceived; because he perceived that she was with child, and he knew that he had not come in unto her. There remained then an unavoidable[fn-44-P4464_1900040:17-nf] suspicion of adultery, and yet because he only had perceived, he only knew it, what does the Gospel say of him? \"Then Joseph being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example.\"[fn-44-P4465_1900242:18-nf] The husband's grief sought no revenge; he wished to profit, not to punish the sinner. \"And not willing to make her a public example, he was minded to put her away privily.\" But while he thought on these things, \"behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him,\"[fn-44-P4466_1900522:19-nf] in sleep; and told him how it was, that she had not defiled her husband's bed, but that she had conceived of the Holy Ghost the Lord of them both. Thy brother then hath sinned against thee; if thou alone know it, then hath he really sinned against thee alone. For if in the hearing of many he hath done thee an injury, he hath sinned against them also whom he hath made witnesses of his iniquity. For I tell you, my dearly beloved Brethren, what you can yourselves recognise in your own case. When any one does my brother an injury in my hearing, God forbid that I should think that injury unconnected with myself. Certainly he has done it to me also; yea to me the rather, to whom he thought what he did was pleasing. Therefore those sins are to be reproved before all, which are committed before all; they are to be reproved with more secresy, which are committed more secretly. Distinguish times, and Scripture is in harmony with itself.","title":"Sermon XXXII. [LXXXII.

Because Matthew set forth the generation of Christ by which He came down to us; and so he began to reckon when Christ was born in a descending order.[fn-45-P4510_1921143:16-nf] Whereas, because Luke begins to reckon when Christ was baptized; in this is the beginning of ascension, he begins to reckon in an ascending order, and in his reckoning he has completed seventy-seven generations.[fn-45-P4511_1921402:17-nf] With whom did he begin his reckoning?

He reckoned up to Adam, and so there are reckoned seventy-seven generations; that is, from Christ up to Adam and from Adam up to Christ are the aforesaid seventy-seven generations. So then if no generation was omitted, there is no exemption of any trespass which ought not to be forgiven.

For so also we read that holy men and those most approved by God employed lying, so as not only to incur no guilt of sin from it, but even to attain the greatest goodness; and if deceitcould confer glory on them, what on the other hand would the truth have brought them but condemnation? Just as Rahab, of whom Scripture gives a record not only of no good deed but actually of unchastity, yet simply for the lie, by means of which she preferred to hide the spies instead of betraying them, had it vouchsafed to her to be joined with the people of God in everlasting blessing. But if she had preferred to speak the truth and to regard the safety of the citizens, there is no doubt that she and all her house would not have escaped the coming destruction, nor would it have beenvouchsafed to her to be inserted in the progenitors of our Lord's nativity,[fn-59-P5909_2087599:10-nf] and reckoned in the list of the patriarchs, and through her descendants that followed, to become the mother of the Saviour of all. Again Dalila, who to provide for the safety of her fellow citizens betrayed the truth she had discovered, obtained in exchange eternal destruction, and has left to all men nothing but the memory of her sin. When then any grave danger hangs on confession of the truth, then we must take to lying as a refuge, yet in such a way as to be for our salvation troubled by the guilt of a humbled conscience. But where there is no call of the utmost necessity present, there a lie should be most carefully avoided as if it were something deadly: just as we said of a cup of hellebore which is indeed useful if it is only taken in the last resort when a deadly and inevitable disease is threatening, while if it is taken when the body is in a state of sound and rude health, its deadly properties at once go to find out the vital parts. And this was clearly shown of Rahab of Jericho, and the patriarch Jacob; the former of whom could only escape death by means of this remedy, while the latter could not secure the blessing of the first-born without it. For God is not only the Judge and inspector of our words and actions, but He also looks into their purpose and aim. And if He sees that anything has been done or promised by some one for the sake of eternal salvation and shows insight into Divine contemplation, even though it may appear to men to be hard and unfair, yet He looks at the inner goodness of the heart and regards the desire of the will rather than the actual words spoken, because He must take into account the aim of the work and the disposition of the doer, whereby, as was said above, one man may be justified by means of a lie, while another may be guilty of a sin of everlasting death by telling the truth. Towhich end the patriarch Jacob also had regard when he was not afraid to imitate the hairy appearance of his brother's body by wrapping himself up in skins, and to his credit acquiesced in his mother's instigation of a lie for this object. For he saw that in this way there would be bestowed on him greater gains of blessing and righteousness than by keeping to the path of simplicity: for he did not doubt that the stain of this lie would at once be washed away by the flood of the paternal blessing, and would speedily be dissolved like a little cloud by the breath of the Holy Spirit; and that richer rewards of merit would be bestowed on him by means of this dissimulation which he put on than by means of the truth, which was natural to him.","title":"XVII.

And this scope is to be found throughout inspired Scripture, as the Lord Himself has said, `Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me[fn-67-P6752_2678144:220-nf] .' But lest I should exceed in writing, by bringing together all the passages on the subject, let it suffice to mention as a specimen, first John saying, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was made not one thing[fn-67-P6753_2678506:221-nf] ;' next, `And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of one Only-begotten from the Fathers[fn-67-P6754_2678659:222-nf] ;' and next Paul writing, `Who being in the form of God, thought it not a prize to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion like a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross[fn-67-P6755_2678978:223-nf] .'

It is no detraction from the fame of our author to admit this, and truth requires it. But the great Alexandrian school must again come into view when we speak of any considerable achievements, among early Christian writers, in this important element of all biblical, in fact, all historical, science. Africanus was a pupil of Heraclas, and we must therefore date his pupilage in Alexandria before a.d. 232, when Dionysius succeeded Heraclas in the presidency of that school. It appears that in a.d. 226 he was performing some duty in behalf of Emmaus (Nicopolis) in Palestine; but Heraclas, who had acted subordinately as Origen's assistant as early as a.d. 218, could not have become the head of the school, even provisionally, till after Origen's unhappy ordination.[fn-21-P2105_601146:2-nf] Let us assume the period of our author's attending the school under Heraclas to be between a.d. 228 and a.d. 232, however.

He adds additional lustre to the age of Gregory Thaumaturgus and Dionysius, as well as to that of their common mother in letters and theology, the already ancient academy of Pantaenus and of Clement. His reviving credit in modern times has been largely due to the learned criticism of Dr. Routh, to whose edition of these Fragments the student must necessarily apply. Their chief interest arises from the important specimen which treats of the difficult question of the genealogies of our Lord contained in the evangelists.

And they will be compelled to say that through the Man Himself the world came into being, and that the Man was He who came not to judge the world but to save it; and that He it was who was in being before Abraham came to be.

For as the Father is One, so also the Only-begotten from Him is One; and what has the Word above the Man, if the Word is not the Son? For, while Scripture says that through the Son and the Word the world was brought to be, and it is common to the Word and to the Son to frame the world, yet Scripture proceeds to place the sight of the Father, not in the Word but in the Son, and to attribute the saving of the world, not to the Word, but to the Only-begotten Son.

Tell me then: if you do not deny that the only Son of God was begotten of God, whom do you make out that He is who was born of Mary? You say \"a mere man,\" according to that which He Himself said: \"That which is born of the flesh, is flesh.\"[fn-73-P7372_2707327:20-nf] But He cannot be called a mere man who was begotten not after the law of human creation alone. \"For that which is conceived in her,\" said the angel, \"is of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-73-P7373_2707521:21-nf] And this even you dare not deny, though you deny almost all the mysteries of salvation.

But how? Truly so as to become a false accuser not only of God, butof the evidences\nthemselves. Nor indeed is it wonderful that, as you cannot do what you want, you only do what you\ncan: as you cannot turn the sacred witnesses against God, you do what you can, and pervert them. For\nyousay: Then Paul tells a lie, when he says of Christ: \"Without mother, without genealogy.\"[fn-75-P7519_2765749:32-nf] I ask you, of whom do you think that Paul said\nthis? Of the Son and Word of God, or of the Christ, whom you separate from the Son of God, and\nblasphemously assert to be a mere man? If of the Christ, whom you maintain to be a mere man, how\ncould a man be born without a mother and without a genealogy on the mother's side? But if of the Word\nof God and Son of God-what can we make of it, when the same Apostle, your own witness, as you\nimpiously imagine, testifies in the same place and by the same witness, that He whom you assert to be\nwithout mother, was also without father; saying, \"Without father, without mother, without genealogy\"?\nIt follows then that if you use the Apostle's witness, since you assert that the Son of God was\n\"without mother,\" you must also be guilty of the blasphemy that He was \"without father.\" You see then\nin what a downfall of impiety you have landed yourself, in your eagerness for your perversity and\nwickedness, so that, while you say that the Son of God had not a mother, you must also deny Him a\nFather-a thing which no one yet since the world began, except perhaps a madman, ever did. And this,\nwhether with greater wickedness or folly, I hardly know; for what is more foolish and silly than to\ngive the name of Son and to try to keep back the name of Father? But you say I don't keep it back, I\ndon't deny it. And what madness then drove you to quote that passage, where, while you say that He\nhad no mother, you must seem also to deny to Him a Father? For as in the same passage He is said to\nbe without mother and also without father, it follows that if it can be understood that there He is\nwithout mother, in the same way in which we understand that He is without mother, we must also\nbelieve that He is without father. But that hasty craze for deny- ing God did not see this; and when\nit quoted mutilated, what was written entire, it failed to see that the shameless and palpable lie\ncould be refuted by laying open the contents of the sacred volume. O foolish blasphemy, and madness!\nwhich, while it failed to see what it ought to follow, had not the wit to see even what could be\nread: as if, because it could get rid of its own intelligence, it could get rid of the power of\nreading from everybody else, or as if everybody would lose their eyes in their heads for reading,\nbecause it had lost the eyes of the mind. Hear then, you heretic the passage you have garbled: hear\nin full and completely, what you quoted mutilated and hacked about. The Apostle wants to make clear\nto every one the twofold birth of God-and in order to show how the Lord was born in the Godhead and\nin flesh, he says, \"Without father, without mother:\" for the one belongs to the birth of Divinity,\nthe other to that of the flesh. For as He was begotten in His Divine nature \"without mother,\" so He\nis in the body \"without father:\" and so though He is neither without father nor without mother, we\nmust believe in Him \"without father and without mother.\" For if you regard Him as He is begotten of\nthe Father, He is without mother: if, as born of His mother, He is without father. And so in each of\nthese births He has one: in both together He is without each: for the birth of Divinity had no need\nof mother, and for the birth of His body, He was Himself sufficient, without a father.

For Scripture says that that which was born of Mary is of the Holy\nGhost.[fn-75-P7537_2772876:38-nf] Who also filled with righteousness\n(justitia) that which was created: for it says `He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the\nSpirit.'[fn-75-P7538_2773036:39-nf] Again: Who made Him also to be\nfeared by the devils: `For I,' He says, `by the Spirit of God cast out devils.'[fn-75-P7539_2773168:40-nf] Who also made His flesh a temple. `For I saw His\nspirit descending like a dove and abiding upon Him.'[fn-75-P7540_2773290:41-nf] Again: Who granted to Him His ascension into\nHeaven. For it says, \"Giving a commandment to the apostles whom He had chosen, by the Holy Ghost He\nwas taken up.\"[fn-75-P7541_2773466:42-nf] Finally that it was He who\ngranted such glory to Christ.\" The whole of your blasphemy then consists in this: that Christ had\nnothing of Himself: nor did He, a mere man, as you say, receive anything from the Word, i.e., the Son\nof God; but everything in Him was the gift of the Spirit. If thenwe can show that all that which you\nrefer to the Spirit, is His own, what remains but that we prove that He whom you therefore would have\ntaken to be a man, because as you say everything which He has is another's, is therefore God, because\neverything which He has is His own? And indeed we will prove this not only by discussion and\nargument, but by the voice of Divinity Itself: for nothing testifies of God better than things\ndivine. And because nothing knows itself better than the very glory of God, we believe nothing on the\nsubject of God with greater right than those writings in which God Himself is His own witness. First\nthen, as to this that you say that the Holy Spirit created His humanity; we might take it simply, if\nwe could acknowledge that you had not brought it forward in the interests of unbelief. For neither do\nwe deny that the flesh of the Lord was conceived by the Holy Ghost: but we assert that the body was\nconceived by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost in such a way that we can say that His\nHumanity[fn-75-P7542_2774807:43-nf] was created for Himself by the\nSon of God, as the Holy Spirit Itself says in holy Scripture, testifying that \"Wisdom hath builded\nfor Itself a house.\"[fn-75-P7543_2774977:44-nf] You see then that\nthat which was conceived by the Holy Ghost was built and perfected by the Son of God: not that the\nwork of the Son of God is one thing, and the work of the Holy Ghost another: but that through the\nunity of the Godhead and glory the operation of the Spirit is the building of the Son of God; and the\nbuilding of the Son of God is the co-operation of the Holy Ghost. And so we read not only that the\nHoly Ghost came upon the Virgin, but also that the power of the Most High overshadowed the Virgin;\nthat since Wisdom Itself is the fulness of the Godhead, no one might doubt that when Wisdom built\nItself a house all the fulness of the Godhead was present. But the wretched hardness of your\nblasphemy, while it tries to sever Christ from the Son of God, fails to see that it is entirely\nsevering the nature of the Godhead from Itself. Unless perhaps you believe that the house is\ntherefore built for Him by the Holy Ghost because He Himself was insufficient and incapable of\nbuilding for Himself an house. But it is as absurd as it is wild, to believe that He, whom we believe\nto have created the whole universe of things heavenly and earthly by His will, was unable to build\nfor Himself a body: especially as the power of the Holy Ghost is His power, and the Divinity and\nGlory of the Trinity are so united and inseparable, that we cannot think of anything at all in One\nPerson of the Trinity, which can be separated from the fulness of the Godhead. Therefore when this is\nlaid down and grasped; viz., that according to the faith of holy Scripture, when the Holy Ghost came\nupon (the Virgin) and the power of the Most High overshadowed her, Wisdom builded Itself an house;\nthe rest of the slanders of your blasphemy come to nothing. For neither is it doubtful that He made\nall things by Himself and in Himself, in whose name and faith, the faith even of believers can do\nanything. For neither did He need the aid of another, as neither have they needed it, who have\ntrusted in His power. And so as for your assertions that He was justified by the Spirit, and that the\nSpirit made Him to be feared by the devils, and that His flesh became the temple of the Holy Ghost,\nand that He was taken up by the Spirit into heaven, they are all blasphemous and wild: not because we\nare to believe that in all these things which He Himself did, the unity and cooperation of the Spirit\nwas wanting - since the Godhead is never wanting to Itself, and the [power of the Trinity was ever\npresent in the Saviour's works - but because you will have it that the Holy Ghost gave assistance to\nthe Lord Jesus Christ as if He had been feeble and powerless; and that He granted those things to\nHim, which He was unable to procure for Himself. Learn then from sacred witnesses to believe God, and\nnot to mingle falsehood with truth: for the subject does not admit it, and common sense abhors the\nidea of mingling the notions of the spirit of the devil with the witnesses that are Divine.","title":"Book VII.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_184_sermon_xxiii_on_the_feast_of_the_nativity_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"The things which are connected with the mystery[fn-30-P3010_715677:1-nf] of to-day's solemn feast are well known to you, dearly-beloved, and have frequently been heard: but as yonder visible light affords pleasure to eyes that are unimpaired, so to sound hearts does the Saviour's nativity give eternal joy; and we must not keep silent about it, though we cannot treat of it as we ought.

In the meantime, it was evident from her shape that she was pregnant, nor could she conceal this from Joseph. For in consequence of his being betrothed to her, coming to her more freely and speaking to her more familiarly, he found out that she was with child. He began then to be in great doubt and perplexity, because he did not know what was best for him to do. For, being a just man, he was not willing to expose her; nor, being a pious man, to injure her fair fame by a suspicion of fornication. He came to the conclusion, therefore, privately to dissolve their contract, and to send her away secretly. And while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, thou son of David, fear not; that is, do not have any suspicion of fornication in the virgin, or think any evil of her; and fear not to take her as thy wife: for that which is begotten in her, and which now vexes thy soul, is the work not of man, but of the Holy Spirit. For she alone of all virgins shall bring forth the Son of God, and thou shalt call His name Jesus, that is, Saviour; for He shall save His people from their sins. Therefore Joseph, according to the command of the angel, took the virgin as his wife; nevertheless he knew her not, but took care of her, and kept her in chastity.[fn-62-P6251_1848531:15-nf] And now the ninth month from her conception was at hand, when Joseph, taking with him his wife along with what things he needed, went to Bethlehem, the city from which he came.

Whereas Luke going backwards step by step traces His succession to the first of the human race himself, to show that the first Adam and the last Adam were of the same nature. No doubt the Almighty Son of God could have appeared for the purpose of teaching, and justifying men in exactly the same way that He appeared both to patriarchs and prophets in the semblance of flesh[fn-11-P1182_284320:4-nf] ; for instance, when He engaged in a struggle, and entered into conversation (with Jacob), or when He refused not hospitable entertainment, and even partook of the food set before Him. But these appearances were indications of that Man whose reality it was announced by mystic predictions would be assumed from the stock of preceding patriarchs. And the fulfilment of the mystery of our atonement, which was ordained from all eternity, was not assisted by any figures because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon the Virgin, and the power of the Most High had not over-shadowed her: so that \"Wisdom building herself a house[fn-11-P1183_285118:5-nf] \" within her undefiled body, \"the Word became flesh;\" and the form of God and the form of a slave coming together into one person, the Creator of times was born in time; and He Himself through whom all things were made, was brought forth in the midst of all things. For if the New Man had not been made in the likeness of sinful flesh, and taken on Him our old nature, and being consubstantial with the Father, had deigned to be consubstantial with His mother also, and being alone free from sin, had united our nature to Him the whole human race would be held in bondage beneath the Devil's yoke[fn-11-P1184_285790:6-nf] , and we should not be able to make use of the Conqueror's victory, if it had been won outside our nature.","title":"Letter XXXI.
