{"verses":["Judge not, that you may not be judged.","For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged:  and with\nwhat measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.","And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye; and\nseest not the beam that is in thy own eye?","Or how sayest thou to thy brother:  Let me cast the mote out of thy\neye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?","Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and\nthen shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.","Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls\nbefore swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and\nturning upon you, they tear you.","Ask, and it shall be given you:  seek, and you shall find:  knock,\nand it shall be opened to you.","For every one that asketh, receiveth:  and he that seeketh,\nfindeth:  and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.","Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask\nbread, will he reach him a stone?","Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?","If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your\nchildren:  how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good\nthings to them that ask him?","All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to\nyou, do you also to them.  For this is the law and the prophets.","Enter ye in at the narrow gate:  for wide is the gate, and broad\nis the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in\nthereat.","How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to\nlife:  and few there are that find it!","Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of\nsheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.","By their fruits you shall know them.  Do men gather grapes of\nthorns, or figs of thistles?","Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil\ntree bringeth forth evil fruit.","A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil\ntree bring forth good fruit.","Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down,\nand shall be cast into the fire.","Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.","Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the\nkingdom of heaven:  but he that doth the will of my Father who is in\nheaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.","Many will say to me in that day:  Lord, Lord, have not we\nprophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many\nmiracles in thy name?","And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you:  depart from\nme, you that work iniquity.","Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them,\nshall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,","And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and\nthey beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a\nrock.","And every one that heareth these my words and doth them not,\nshall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,","And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and\nthey beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.","And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the\npeople were in admiration at his doctrine.","For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the\nscribes and Pharisees."]}
