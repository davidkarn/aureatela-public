It is this difference in their sins which separates Judas the betrayer from Peter the denier: not that a penitent is not to be pardoned, for we must not come into collision with that declaration of our Lord, where He enjoins that a brother is to be pardoned, when he asks his brother to pardon him;[fn-5-P555_195135:221-nf] but that the ruin connected with that sin is so great, that he cannot endure the humiliation of asking for it, even if he should be compelled by a bad conscience both to acknowledge and divulge his sin.

And therefore it is of much consequence to know what sort of repentance God pardons. For many much more readily confess that they have sinned, and are so angry with themselves that they vehemently wish they had not sinned; but yet they do not condescend to humble the heart and to make it contrite, and to implore pardon: and this disposition of mind we must suppose them to have, as feeling themselves already condemned because of the greatness of their sin.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"248","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"While the disciples were disputing concerning precedence our Lord, the teacher of humility, took a little child and said: \"Except ye be converted and become as little children ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-3-P341_60644:157-nf] And lest He should seem to preach more than he practised, He fulfilled His own precept in His life.

The question you send is short and the answer is clear. There is this passage in the gospel: \"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come.\"[fn-13-P1323_290045:892-nf] Now if Novatian affirms that none but Christian renegades can sin against the Holy Ghost, it is plain that the Jews who blasphemed Christ were not guilty of this sin. Yet they were wicked husbandmen, they had slain the prophets, they were then compassing the death of the Lord;[fn-13-P1324_290345:893-nf] and so utterly lost were they that the Son of God told them that it was they whom he had come to save.[fn-13-P1325_290470:894-nf] It must be proved to Novatian, therefore, that the sin which shall never be forgiven is not the blasphemy of men disembowelled by torture who in their agony deny their Lord, but is the captious clamor of those who, while they see that God's works are the fruit of virtue, ascribe the virtue to a demon and declare the signs wrought to belong not to the divine excellence but to the devil. And this is the whole gist of our Saviour's argument, when He teaches that Satan cannot be cast out by Satan, and that his kingdom is not divided against itself.[fn-13-P1326_291045:895-nf] If it is the devil's object to injure God's creation, how can he wish to cure the sick and to expel himself from the bodies possessed by him?

For what Catholic, what Christian who adorns his faith with good works, can hear with calmness Origen's teaching and counsel, or believe in his extraordinary preaching? \"The Son,\" he tells us, \"cannot see the Father, and the Holy Spirit cannot see the Son.\" These words occur in his book \"On First Principles;\" thus we read, and thus Origen has spoken. \"For as it is unsuitable to say that the Son can see the Father, it is consequently unsuitable to suppose that the Spirit can see the Son.\"[fn-18-P1803_438397:1251-nf] Can any one, moreover, brook Origen's assertion that men's souls were once angels in heaven, and that having sinned in the upper world, they have been cast down into this, and have been confined in bodies as in barrows or tombs, to pay the penalty for their former sins; and that the bodies of believers are not temples of Christ,[fn-18-P1804_438768:1252-nf] but prisons of the condemned? Again, he tampers with the true meaning of the narrative by a false use of allegory, multiplying words without limit; and undermines the faith of the simple by the most varied arguments. Now he maintains that souls, in Greek the \"cool things,\" from a word meaning to be cool,[fn-18-P1805_439113:1253-nf] are so called because in coming down from the heavenly places to the lower world they have lost their former heat;[fn-18-P1806_439318:1254-nf] and now, that our bodies are called by the Greeks chains, from a word meaning chain,[fn-18-P1807_439436:1255-nf] or else (on the analogy of our own Latin word) \"things fallen,\"[fn-18-P1808_439541:1256-nf] because our souls have fallen from heaven; and that the other word for body which the abundance of the Greek idiom supplies[fn-18-P1809_439715:1257-nf] is by many taken to mean a funeral monument,[fn-18-P1810_439775:1258-nf] because the soul is shut up within it in the same way as the corpses of the dead are shut up in tombs and barrows. If this doctrine is true what becomes of our faith? Where is the preaching of the resurrection? Where is the teaching of the apostles, which lasts on to this day in the churches of Christ? Where is the blessing to Adam, and to his seed, and to Noah and his sons? \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\"[fn-18-P1811_440222:1259-nf] According to Origen, these words must be a curse and not a blessing; for he turns angels into human souls, compelling them to leave the place of highest rank and to come down lower, as though God were unable through the action of His blessing to grant souls to the human race, had the angels not sinned, and as though for every birth on earth there must be a fall in heaven. We are to give up, then, the teaching of apostles and prophets, of the law, and of our Lord and Saviour Himself, in spite of His language loud as thunder in the gospel. Origen, on the other hand, commands and urges-not to say binds-his disciples not to pray to ascend into heaven, lest sinning once more worse than they had sinned on earth they should be hurled down into the world again. Such foolish and insane notions he generally confirms by distorting the sense of the Scriptures and making them mean what they do not mean at all. He quotes this passage from the Psalms: \"Before thou didst humble me by reason of my wickedness, I went wrong;\"[fn-18-P1812_441278:1260-nf] and this, \"Return unto thy rest, O my soul;\"[fn-18-P1813_441398:1261-nf] this also, \"Bring my soul out of prison;\"[fn-18-P1814_441462:1262-nf] and this, \"I will make confession unto the Lord in the land of the living,\"[fn-18-P1815_441562:1263-nf] although there can be no doubt that the meaning of the divine Scripture is different from the interpretation by which he unfairly wrests it to the support of his own heresy. This way of acting is common to the Manichaeans, the Gnostics, the Ebionites, the Marcionites, and the votaries of the other eighty heresies,[fn-18-P1816_441946:1264-nf] all of whom draw their proofs from the pure well of the Scriptures, not, however, interpreting it in the sense in which it is written, but trying to make the simple language of the Church's writers accord with their own wishes.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"577","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"4.

Now he maintains that souls, in Greek the \"cool things,\" from a word meaning to be cool,[fn-18-P1805_439113:1253-nf] are so called because in coming down from the heavenly places to the lower world they have lost their former heat;[fn-18-P1806_439318:1254-nf] and now, that our bodies are called by the Greeks chains, from a word meaning chain,[fn-18-P1807_439436:1255-nf] or else (on the analogy of our own Latin word) \"things fallen,\"[fn-18-P1808_439541:1256-nf] because our souls have fallen from heaven; and that the other word for body which the abundance of the Greek idiom supplies[fn-18-P1809_439715:1257-nf] is by many taken to mean a funeral monument,[fn-18-P1810_439775:1258-nf] because the soul is shut up within it in the same way as the corpses of the dead are shut up in tombs and barrows. If this doctrine is true what becomes of our faith? Where is the preaching of the resurrection? Where is the teaching of the apostles, which lasts on to this day in the churches of Christ? Where is the blessing to Adam, and to his seed, and to Noah and his sons? \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\"[fn-18-P1811_440222:1259-nf] According to Origen, these words must be a curse and not a blessing; for he turns angels into human souls, compelling them to leave the place of highest rank and to come down lower, as though God were unable through the action of His blessing to grant souls to the human race, had the angels not sinned, and as though for every birth on earth there must be a fall in heaven. We are to give up, then, the teaching of apostles and prophets, of the law, and of our Lord and Saviour Himself, in spite of His language loud as thunder in the gospel. Origen, on the other hand, commands and urges-not to say binds-his disciples not to pray to ascend into heaven, lest sinning once more worse than they had sinned on earth they should be hurled down into the world again. Such foolish and insane notions he generally confirms by distorting the sense of the Scriptures and making them mean what they do not mean at all. He quotes this passage from the Psalms: \"Before thou didst humble me by reason of my wickedness, I went wrong;\"[fn-18-P1812_441278:1260-nf] and this, \"Return unto thy rest, O my soul;\"[fn-18-P1813_441398:1261-nf] this also, \"Bring my soul out of prison;\"[fn-18-P1814_441462:1262-nf] and this, \"I will make confession unto the Lord in the land of the living,\"[fn-18-P1815_441562:1263-nf] although there can be no doubt that the meaning of the divine Scripture is different from the interpretation by which he unfairly wrests it to the support of his own heresy. This way of acting is common to the Manichaeans, the Gnostics, the Ebionites, the Marcionites, and the votaries of the other eighty heresies,[fn-18-P1816_441946:1264-nf] all of whom draw their proofs from the pure well of the Scriptures, not, however, interpreting it in the sense in which it is written, but trying to make the simple language of the Church's writers accord with their own wishes.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"867","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1. So overpowered am I by the sad intelligence of the falling asleep of the holy and by me deeply revered Lucinius that I am scarcely able to dictate even a short letter. I do not, it is true, lament his fate, for I know that he has passed to better things: like Moses he can say: \"I will now turn aside and see this great sight.\"[fn-31-P3134_819754:2268-nf] but I am tormented with regret that I was not allowed to look upon the face of one, who was likely, as I believed, in a short time to come hither. True indeed is the prophetic warning concerning the doom of death that it divides brothers,[fn-31-P3135_820016:2269-nf] and with harsh and cruel hand sunders those whose names are linked together in the bonds of love. But we have this consolation that it is slain by the word of the Lord. For it is said: \"O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction,\" and in the next verse: \"An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.\"[fn-31-P3136_820533:2270-nf] For, as Isaiah says, \"there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots\":[fn-31-P3137_820692:2271-nf] and He says Himself in the Song of Songs, \"I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley.\"[fn-31-P3138_820815:2272-nf] Our rose is the destruction of death, and died that death itself might die in His dying. But, when it is said that He is to be brought \"from the wilderness,\" the virgin's womb is indicated, which without sexual intercourse or impregnation has given to us God in the form of an infant able to quench by the glow of the Holy Spirit the fountains of lust and to sing in the words of the psalm: \"as in a dry and pathless and waterless land, so have I appeared unto thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-31-P3139_821322:2273-nf] Thus when we have to face the hard and cruel necessity of death, we are upheld by this consolation, that we shall shortly see again those whose absence we now mourn. For their end is not called death but a slumber and a falling asleep. Wherefore also the blessed apostle forbids us to sorrow concerning them which are asleep,[fn-31-P3140_821680:2274-nf] telling us to believe that those whom we know to sleep now may hereafter be roused from their sleep, and when their slumber is ended may watch once more with the saints and sing with the angels:-\"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among men of good will.\"[fn-31-P3141_821974:2275-nf] In heaven where there is no sin, there is glory and perpetual praise and unwearied singing; but on earth where sedition reigns, and war and discord hold sway, peace must be gained by prayer, and it is to be found not among all but only among men of good will, who pay heed to the apostolic salutation: \"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-31-P3142_822376:2276-nf] For \"His abode is in peace and His dwelling place is in Zion,\"[fn-31-P3143_822459:2277-nf] that is, on a watch-tower,[fn-31-P3144_822552:2278-nf] on a height of doctrines and of virtues, in the soul of the believer; for the angel of this latter daily beholds the face of God,[fn-31-P3145_822750:2279-nf] and contemplates with unveiled face the glory of God.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1251","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Hear the words of Ezekiel: \"as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.\"[fn-44-P4481_1217252:3184-nf] The Lord judges every man according as he finds him.

Cyprian to Magnus his son, greeting. With your usual religious diligence, you have consulted my poor intelligence, dearest son, as to whether, among other heretics, they also who come from Novatian ought, after his profane washing, to be baptized, and sanctified in the Catholic Church, with the lawful, and true, and only baptism of the Church. Respecting which matter, as much as the capacity of my faith and the sanctity and truth of the divine Scriptures suggest, I answer, that no heretics and schismatics at all have any power or right. For which reason Novatian neither ought to be nor can be expected, inasmuch as he also is without the Church and acting in opposition to the peace and love of Christ, from being counted among adversaries and antichrists. For our Lord Jesus Christ, when He testified in His Gospel that those who were not with Him were His adversaries, did not point out any species of heresy, but showed that all whatsoever who were not with Him, and who, not gathering with Him, were scattering His flock, were His adversaries; saying, \"He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.\"[fn-64-P6477_2085279:2-nf] Moreover, the blessed Apostle John himself distinguished no heresy or schism, neither did he set down any as specially separated; but he called all who had gone out from the Church, and who acted in opposition to the Church, antichrists, saying, \"Ye have heard that Antichrist cometh, and even now are come many antichrists; wherefore we know that this is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.\"[fn-64-P6478_2085850:3-nf] Whence it appears, that all are adversaries of the Lord and antichrists, who are known to have departed from charity and from the unity of the Catholic Church. In addition, moreover, the Lord establishes it in His Gospel, and says, \"But if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.\"[fn-64-P6479_2086198:4-nf] Now if they who despise the Church are counted heathens and publicans, much more certainly is it necessary that rebels and enemies, who forge false altars, and lawless priesthoods, and sacrilegious sacrifices, and corrupter names, should be counted among heathens and publicans; since they who sin less, and are only despisers of the Church, are by the Lord's sentence judged to be heathens and publicans.","title":"Epistle LXXV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":18,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_03_introduction","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"In Hilary's eyes the two Testaments form one homogeneous revelation, of equal value throughout[fn-3-P318_266629:150-nf] , and any part of the whole may be used in explanation of any other part. The same title of beatissimus is given to Daniel and to St. Paul when both are cited in Comm. in Matt. xxv. 3; indeed, he and others of his day seem to have felt that the Saints of the Old Covenant were as near to themselves as those of the New. Not many years bad passed since Christians were accustom d to encourage themselves to martyrdom, in default of well-known heroes of their own faith , by the example of Daniel and his companions, or of the Seven Maccabees and their Mother. But Scripture is not only harmonious throughout, as Origen had taught; it is also never otiose. It never repeats itself, and a significance must be sought not only in the smallest differences of language, but also in the order in which apparent synonyms occur[fn-3-P319_267593:151-nf] ; in fact, every detail, and every sense in which every detail may be interpreted, is a matter for profitable enquiry[fn-3-P320_267870:152-nf] .

Hilary's explanation of the words, 'My soul is sorrowful even unto death,' in Tract. in Ps. cxli. efmqefmrefmsefmtefmuefmvefmwefmxefmy~ . His confidence in their work, which is not exceeded by that of St. Augustine, encourages him to draw lessons from the differences between the Hebrew and theSeptuagint titles of the Pslams. For instance, Psalm cxlii. has been furnished in the Septuagint with a title which attributes it to David when pursued by Absalom. The contents of the Psalm are appropriate neither to the circumstances nor to the date. But this does not justify us in ignoring the title. We must regard the fact that a wrong connection is given to the Pslam as a warning to ourselves not to attempt to discover its historical position, but confine ourselves to its spiritual sense. And this is not all. Another Psalm, the third, is assigned in the Hebrew to the same king in the same distress. But, though this attribution is certainly correct, here also we must follow the leading of the Septuagint, which was fell to give a wrong title to one Psalm lest we should attach importance to the correct title of another.

The same title of beatissimus is given to Daniel and to St. Paul when both are cited in Comm. in Matt. xxv. 3; indeed, he and others of his day seem to have felt that the Saints of the Old Covenant were as near to themselves as those of the New. Not many years bad passed since Christians were accustom d to encourage themselves to martyrdom, in default of well-known heroes of their own faith , by the example of Daniel and his companions, or of the Seven Maccabees and their Mother. But Scripture is not only harmonious throughout, as Origen had taught; it is also never otiose. It never repeats itself, and a significance must be sought not only in the smallest differences of language, but also in the order in which apparent synonyms occur[fn-3-P319_267593:151-nf] ; in fact, every detail, and every sense in which every detail may be interpreted, is a matter for profitable enquiry[fn-3-P320_267870:152-nf] .

His confidence in their work, which is not exceeded by that of St. Augustine, encourages him to draw lessons from the differences between the Hebrew and theSeptuagint titles of the Pslams. For instance, Psalm cxlii. has been furnished in the Septuagint with a title which attributes it to David when pursued by Absalom. The contents of the Psalm are appropriate neither to the circumstances nor to the date. But this does not justify us in ignoring the title. We must regard the fact that a wrong connection is given to the Pslam as a warning to ourselves not to attempt to discover its historical position, but confine ourselves to its spiritual sense. And this is not all. Another Psalm, the third, is assigned in the Hebrew to the same king in the same distress. But, though this attribution is certainly correct, here also we must follow the leading of the Septuagint, which was fell to give a wrong title to one Psalm lest we should attach importance to the correct title of another. In both cases we must fix our attention not On the afflictions of David, but on the sorrows of Christ.

When, however, it is curbed from unlawful desires, and is permitted only for the orderly propagation and renewal of the human race, this is the good of wedlock, by which man is born in the union that is appointed. Nobody, however, is born again in Christ's body, unless he be previously born in the body of sin. But inasmuch as it is evil to make a bad use of a good thing, so is it good to use well a bad thing. These two ideas therefore of good and evil, and those other two of a good use and an evil use, when they are duly combined together, produce four different conditions:-[1] A man makes a good use of a good thing, when he dedicates his continence to God; [2.] He makes a bad use of a good thing, when he dedicates his continence to an idol;[3.] He makes a bad use of an evil thing, when he loosely gratifies his concupiscence by adultery; [4.] He makes a good use of an evil thing, when he restrains his concupiscence by matrimony.

He only was born without sin whom a virgin conceived without the embrace of a husband,-not by the concupiscence of the flesh, but by the chaste submission of her mind.[fn-6-P650_432149:205-nf] She alone was able to give birth to One who should heal our wound, who brought forth the germ of a pure offspring without the wound of sin.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"38. Moreover, from the things created at the beginning may be learnt the fellowship of the Spirit with the Father and the Son. The pure, intelligent, and supermundane powers are and are styled holy, because they have their holiness of the grace given by the Holy Spirit. Accordingly the mode of the creation of the heavenly powers is passed over in Silence, for the historian of the cosmogony has revealed to us only the creation of things perceptible by sense. But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures whom we cannot name.[fn-15-P1559_383788:327-nf] And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover, the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me either to affirm that there are three original hypostases[fn-15-P1560_384325:328-nf] or to allege the operation of the Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the Son and perfecting through the Spirit.[fn-15-P1561_384514:329-nf] The operation of the Father who worketh all in all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son, but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the Spirit. \"For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.\"[fn-15-P1562_385080:330-nf] The Word then is not a mere significant impression on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who \"was with God in the beginning\" and \"was God,\"[fn-15-P1563_385462:331-nf] and the Spirit of the mouth of God is \"the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-15-P1564_385668:332-nf] You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the Word who creates,and the Spirit who confirms.[fn-15-P1565_385807:333-nf] And what other thing could confirmation be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfectingexpresses the confirmation's firmness,unchangeableness,and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial fire, as it is written, \"Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;\"[fn-15-P1566_386607:334-nf] wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance, superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and distinctness. For how are angels to cry \"Glory to God in the highest\"[fn-15-P1567_387331:335-nf] without being empowered by the Spirit? For \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;\"[fn-15-P1568_387931:336-nf] as might be said by wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice, and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel[fn-15-P1569_388251:337-nf] in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires[fn-15-P1570_388533:338-nf] derive the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit? The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1571_388790:339-nf] And how could \"thrones, dominions, principalities and powers\"[fn-15-P1572_388871:340-nf] live their blessed life, did they not \"behold the face of the Father which is in heaven\"?[fn-15-P1573_389017:341-nf] But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night, if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive, and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without the guidance of the coryphaeus.

He boasts that David bought his wife for two hundred foreskins. But he should remember that David had numerous other wives, and afterwards received Michal, Saul's daughter, whom her father had delivered to another, and when he was old got heat from the embrace of the Shunammite maiden. And I do not say this because I am bold enough to disparage holy men, but because it is one thing to live under the law, another to live under the Gospel. David slew Uriah the Hittite and committed adultery with Bathsheba. And because he was a man of blood-the reference is not, as some think, to his wars, but to the[fn-63-P6302_1929912:145-nf] murder-he was not permitted to build a temple of the Lord.

He passes on to Solomon, through whom wisdom itself sang its own praises. Seeing that not content with dwelling upon his praises, he calls him uxorious, I am surprised that he did not add the words of the Canticles:[fn-63-P6306_1930563:149-nf] \"There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and maidens without number,\" and those of the First Book of Kings;[fn-63-P6307_1930706:150-nf] And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines, and others without number.\" These are they who turned away his heart from the Lord: and yet before he had many wives, and fell into sins of the flesh, at the beginning of his reign and in his early years he built a temple to the Lord. For every one is judged not for what he will be, but for what he is. But if Jovinianus approves the example of Solomon, he will no longer be in favour of second and third marriages only, but unless he has seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, he cannot be the king's antitype or attain to his merit. I earnestly again and again remind you, my reader, that I am compelled to speak as I do, and that I do not disparage our predecessors under the law, but am well aware that they served their generation according to their circumstances, and fulfilled the Lord's command to increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And what is more they were figures of those that were to come. But we to whom it is said,[fn-63-P6308_1931759:151-nf] \"The time is shortened, that henceforth those that have wives may be as though they had none,\" have a different command, and for us virginity is consecrated by the Virgin Saviour.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"26. Coming to the Gospel he sets before us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his mother-in-law, and, with a shamelessness to which we have now grown accustomed, fails to understand that they, too, ought to have been reckoned among those who served the Law. For the Gospel had no being before the crucifixion of Christ-it was consecrated by His passion and by His blood. In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage. For when Peter, representing the Apostles, says to the Lord:[fn-63-P6320_1936460:161-nf] \"Lo we have left all and followed thee,\" the Lord answered him,[fn-63-P6321_1936546:162-nf] \"Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.\" But if, in order to show that all the Apostles had wives, he meets us with the words[fn-63-P6322_1936898:163-nf] \"Have we no right to lead about women or wives\" (for gunh in Greek has both meanings) \"even as the rest of the apostles, and Cephas, and the brethren of the Lord?\" let him add what is found in the Greek copies, \"Have we no right to lead about women that are sisters, or wives?\" This makes it clear that the writer referred to other holy women, who, in accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself. Where there is a previous reference to eating and drinking, and the outlay of money, and mention is afterwards made of women that are sisters, it is quite clear, as we have said, that we must understand, not wives, but those women who ministered of their substance. And we read the same account in the Old Testament of the Shunammite who was wont to welcome Elisha, and to put for him a table, and bread, and a candlestick, and the rest. At all events if we take gunaikaj to mean wives, not women, the addition of the word sisters destroys the effect of the word wives, and shews that they were related in spirit, not by wedlock. Nevertheless, with the exception of the Apostle Peter, it is not openly stated that the Apostles had wives; and since the statement is made of one while nothing is said about the rest, we must understand that those of whom Scripture gives no such description had no wives. Yet Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his wife's mother, should know, that John was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, that is, a virgin was the offspring of marriage, the Gospel of the law, chastity of matrimony; so that by a virgin prophet the virgin Lord might be both announced and baptized. But we might say concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he believed, and no longer had a wife, although in the[fn-63-P6323_1939524:164-nf] \"Sentences\" we read of both his wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the typical Christian teachers, were not virgins. If, then, we allow that they were not virgins (and, with the exception of Peter, the point cannot be proved), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that the words of Isaiah relate:[fn-63-P6324_1940049:165-nf] \"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\" So, then, they who were by birth Jews could not under the Gospel recover the virginity which they had lost in Judaism. And yet John, one of the disciples, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and who was a virgin when he embraced Christianity, remained a virgin, and on that account was more beloved by our Lord, and lay upon the breast of Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask,[fn-63-P6325_1940620:166-nf] he requested John to ask. And after the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had risen,[fn-63-P6326_1940754:167-nf] they both ran to the sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles knew not who it was they saw;[fn-63-P6327_1940972:168-nf] the virgin alone recognized a virgin, and said to Peter, \"It is the Lord.\" Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the cross. Peter said, \"Lord what shall this man do?\" being unwilling to desert John, with whom he had always been united. Our Lord said to him, \"What is that to thee if I wish him so to be?\" Whence the saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die. Here we have a proof that virginity does not die, and that the defilement of marriage is not washed away by the blood of martyrdom, but virginity abides with Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If, however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a virgin, (whereas we have maintained that his virginity was the cause of the special love our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a virgin, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But you say,[fn-63-P6328_1941990:169-nf] the Church was rounded upon Peter: although[fn-63-P6329_1942059:170-nf] elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the Church depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for schism. But why was not John chosen, who was a virgin? Deference was paid to age, because Peter was the eider: one who was a youth, I may say almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his disciples, and who had said to them,[fn-63-P6330_1942702:171-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\" and,[fn-63-P6331_1942783:172-nf] \"He that is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,\" would not be thought to afford cause of envy against the youth whom he had loved. We maybe sure that John was then a boy because ecclesiastical history most clearly proves that he lived to the reign of Trajan, that is, he fell asleep in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord's passion, as I have briefly noted in my treatise on Illustrious Men.[fn-63-P6332_1943234:173-nf] Peter is an Apostle, and John is an Apostle-the one a married man, the other a virgin; but Peter is an Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a prophet. An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist, because he composed a Gospel, a thing which no other of the Apostles, excepting Matthew, did; a prophet, for he saw in the island of Patmos, to which he had been banished by the Emperor Domitian as a martyr for the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless mysteries of the future Tertullian, more over, relates that he was sent to Rome, and that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher and more active than when he went in. But his very Gospel is widely different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man begins thus: \"The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;\" Luke begins with the priesthood of Zacharias; Mark with a prophecy of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. The first has the face of a man, on account of the genealogical table; the second, the face of a calf, on account of the priesthood; the third, the face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the desert,[fn-63-P6333_1944501:174-nf] \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" But John like an eagle soars aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says,[fn-63-P6334_1944656:175-nf] \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God,\" and so on. The virgin writer expounded mysteries which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how great was the privilege of John, or rather of virginity in John, the Virgin Mother[fn-63-P6335_1944999:176-nf] was entrusted by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin disciple.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Now we must proceed, in the case of the prodigal son, to consider first that which is more useful; for no adjustment of examples, albeit in the most nicely-poised balance, shall be admitted if it shall prove to be most hurtful to salvation. But the whole system of salvation, as it is comprised in the maintenance of discipline, we see is being subverted by that interpretation which is affected by the opposite side. For if it is a Christian who, after wandering far from his Father, squanders, by living heathenishly, the \"substance\" received from God his Father,-(the substance), of course, of baptism-(the substance), of course, of the Holy Spirit, and (in consequence) of eternal hope; if, stripped of his mental \"goods,\" he has even handed his service over to the prince of the world[fn-14-P1416_398528:103-nf] -who else but the devil?-and by him being appointed over the business of \"feeding swine\"-of tending unclean spirits, to wit-has recovered his senses so as to return to his Father,-the result will be, that, not adulterers and fornicators, but idolaters, and blasphemers, and renegades, and every class of apostates, will by this parable make satisfaction to the Father; and in this way (it may) rather (be said that) the whole \"substance\" of the sacrament is most truly wasted away. For who will fear to squander what he has the power of afterwards recovering? Who will be careful to preserve to perpetuity what he will be able to lose not to perpetuity? Security in sin is likewise an appetite for it. Therefore the apostate withal will recover his former \"garment,\" the robe of the Holy Spirit; and a renewal of the \"ring,\" the sign and seal of baptism; and Christ will again be \"slaughtered; \"[fn-14-P1417_399474:104-nf] and he will recline on that couch from which such as are unworthily clad are wont to be lifted by the torturers, and cast away into darkness,[fn-14-P1418_399701:105-nf] -much more such as have been stripped. It is therefore a further step if it is not expedient, (any more than reasonable), that the story of the prodigal son should apply to a Christian. Wherefore, if the image of a \"son\" is not entirely suitable to a Jew either, our interpretation shall be simply governed with an eye to the object the Lord had in view. The Lord had come, of course, to save that which \"had perished; \"[fn-14-P1419_400152:106-nf] \"a Physician.\" necessary to \"the sick\" \"more than to the whole.\"[fn-14-P1420_400245:107-nf] This fact He was in the habit both of typifying in parables and preaching in direct statements. Who among men \"perishes,\" who falls from health, but he who knows not the Lord? Who is \"safe and sound,\" but he who knows the Lord? These two classes-\"brothers\" by birth-this parable also will signify. See whether the heathen have in God the Father the \"substance\" of origin, and wisdom, and natural power of Godward recognition; by means of which power the apostle withal notes that \"in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom knew not God,\"[fn-14-P1421_400834:108-nf] -(wisdom) which, of course, it had received originally from God. This (\"substance\"), accordingly, he \"squandered; \"having been cast by his moral habits far from the Lord, amid the errors and allurements and appetites of the world,[fn-14-P1422_401086:109-nf] where, compelled by hunger after truth,[fn-14-P1423_401142:110-nf] he handed himself over to the prince of this age. He set him over \"swine,\" to feed that flock familiar to demons,[fn-14-P1424_401278:111-nf] where he would not be master of a supply of vital food, and at the same time would see others (engaged) in a divine work, having abundance of heavenly bread. He remembers his Father, God; he returns to Him when he has been satisfied; he receives again the pristine \"garment,\"-the condition, to wit, which Adam by transgression had lost. The \"ring\" also he is then Wont to receive for the first time, wherewith, after being interrogated,[fn-14-P1425_401779:112-nf] he publicly seals the agreement of faith, and thus thenceforward feeds upon the \"fatness\" of the Lord's body,-the Eucharist, to wit. This will be the prodigal son, who never in days bygone was thrifty; who was from the first prodigal, because not from the first a Christian. Him withal, returning from the world to the Father's embraces, the Pharisees mourned over, in the persons of the \"publicans and sinners.\" And accordingly to this point alone the elder brother's envy is adapted: not because the Jews were innocent, and obedient to God, but because they envied the nation salvation; being plainly they who ought to have been \"ever with\" the Father. And of course it is immediately over the first calling of the Christian that the Jew groans, not over his second restoration: for the former reflects its rap even upon the heathen; but the latter, which takes place in the churches, is not known even to the Jews. I think that I have advanced interpretations more consonant with the subject-matter of the parables, and the congruity of things, and the preservation of disciplines. But if the view with which the opposite party is eager to mould the ewe, and the drachma, and the voluptuousness of the son to the shape of the Christian sinner, is that they may endow adultery and fornication with (the gift of) repentance; it will be fitting either that all other crimes equally capital should be conceded remissible, or else that their peers, adultery and fornication, should be retained inconcessible.","title":"VII.

These two angelic communities, then, dissimilar and contrary to one another, the one both by nature good and by will upright, the other also good by nature but by will depraved, as they are exhibited in other and more explicit passages of holy writ, so I think they are spoken of in this book of Genesis under the names of light and darkness; and even if the author perhaps had a different meaning, yet our discussion of the obscure language has not been wasted time; for, though we have been unable to discover his meaning, yet we have adhered to the rule of faith, which is sufficiently ascertained by the faithful from other passages of equal authority.

For wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, I am with them; \"[fn-68-P6884_2214119:38-nf] showing that most is given, not to the multitude, but to the unanimity of those that pray. \"If,\" He says, \"two of you shall agree on earth: \"He placed agreement first; He has made the concord of peace a prerequisite; He taught that we should agree firmly and faithfully. But how can he agree with any one who does not agree with the booty of the Church itself, and with the universal brotherhood?

For we have not withdrawn from them, but they from us; and since heresies and schisms have risen subsequently, from their establishment for themselves of diverse places of worship, they have forsaken the Head and Source of the truth. But the Lord speaks concerning His Church, and to those also who are in the Church He speaks, that if they are in agreement, if according to what He commanded and admonished, although only two or three gathered together with unanimity should pray-though they be only two or three-they may obtain from the majesty of God what they ask. \"Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, I,\" slays He, \"am with them; \"that is, with the simple and peaceable-with those who fear God and keep God's commandments. With these, although only two or three, He said that He was, in the same manner as He was with the three youths in the fiery furnace; and because they abode towards God in simplicity, and in unanimity among themselves, He animated them, in the midst of the surrounding flames, with the breath of dew: in the way in which, with the two apostles shut up in prison, because they were simple-minded and of one mind, He Himself was present; He Himself, having loosed the bolts of the dungeon, placed them again in the market-place, that they might declare to the multitude the word which they faithfully preached. When, therefore, in His commandments He lays it down, and says, \"Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am with them,\" He does not divide men from the Church, seeing that He Himself ordained and made the Church; but rebuking the faithless for their discord, and commending peace by His word to the faithful, He shows that He is rather with two or three who pray with one mind, than with a great many who differ, and that more can be obtained by the discordant prayer of a few, than by the discordant supplication of many.","title":"Treatise I.

The disciples then of the Lord Jesus Christ while yet under the Law had to be cleansed still, to be nourished still, to be corrected stilI, to be directed still. For they still had concupiscence; whereas the Law saith, \"Thou shalt not lust.\"[fn-68-P6842_2874224:29-nf] Without offence to those holy rams, the leaders of the flock, without offence to them I would say it, for I say the truth: the Gospel relates, that they contended which of them should be the greatest, and whilst the Lord was yet on earth, they were agitated by a dissension about pre-eminence.[fn-68-P6843_2874546:30-nf] Whence was this, but from the old leaven? whence, but from the law in the members, resisting the law of the mind? They sought for eminence; yea, they desired it; they thought which should be the greatest; therefore is their pride put to shame by a little child.[fn-68-P6844_2874827:31-nf] Jesus calleth unto him the age of humility to tame the swelling desire. With good reason then when they returned too, and said, \"Lord, behold even the devils are subject unto us through Thy Name.\" (It was for a nothing that they rejoiced; of what importance was it compared to that which God promised?) The Lord, the Good Master, quieting fear, and building up a firm support, said to them, \"In this rejoice not that the devils are subject unto you.\" Why so? Because \"many will come in My Name, saying, Behold, in Thy Name we have cast out devils; and I will say to them, I know you not. In this rejoice not, but rejoice because your Dances are written in heaven.\"[fn-68-P6845_2875512:32-nf] Ye cannot yet be there, yet notwithstanding ye are already written there. Therefore\" rejoice.\" So that place again, \"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My Name.\"[fn-68-P6846_2875695:33-nf] For what ye have asked, in comparison with that which I am willing to give, is nothing. For what have ye asked in My Name? That the devils should be subject unto you? \"In this rejoice not,\" that is, what ye have asked is nothing; for if it were anything, He would bid them rejoice. So then it was not absolutely nothing, but that it was little in comparison of that greatness of God's rewards. For the Apostle Paul was not really not anything; and yet in comparison of God, \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth.\"[fn-68-P6847_2876267:34-nf] And so I say to you, and I say to myself, both to myself and you I say, when we ask in Christ's Name for these temporal things. For ye have asked undoubtedly. For who doth not ask? One asketh for health, if he is sick; another asketh for deliverance, if he is in prison; another asketh for the port, if he is tossed about at sea; another asketh for victory, if he is in conflict with an enemy; and in the Name of Christ he asketh all, and what he asketh is nothing. What then must be asked for? \"Ask in My Name.\"[fn-68-P6848_2876799:35-nf] And He said not what, but by the very words we understand what we ought to ask. \"Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. Ask, and ye shall receive, in My Name.\" But what? Not nothing; but what? \"That your joy may be full;\" that is, ask what may suffice you. For when thou askest for temporal things, thou askest for nothing. \"Whoso shall drink of this water, shall thirst again.\"[fn-68-P6849_2877213:36-nf] He letteth down the watering pot of desire into the well, he taketh up whereof to drink, only that he may thirst again. \"Ask, that your joy may be full;\" that is, that ye may be satisfied, not feel delight only for a time. Ask what may suffice you; speak Philip's language, \"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-68-P6850_2877554:37-nf] The Lord saith to you, \"Have I been so long time with you, and have ye not known Me? Philip, he that seeth Me, seeth the Father also.\"[fn-68-P6851_2877707:38-nf] Render then thanks to Christ, made weak for you that are weak, and make ready your desires[fn-68-P6852_2877825:39-nf] for Christ's Divinity, to be satisfied therewith.

For, after saying that the devil is bound a thousand years and is afterwards loosed for a short season, it goes on to give a sketch of what the Church does or of what is done in the Church in those days, in the words, \"And I saw seats and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given.\" It is not to be supposed that this refers to the last judgment, but to the seats of the rulers and to the rulers themselves by whom the Church is now governed. And no better interpretation of judgment being given can be produced than that which we have in the words, \"What ye bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what ye loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"[fn-38-P3860_2124219:52-nf] Whence the apostle says, \"What have I to do with judging them that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?\"[fn-38-P3861_2124360:53-nf] \"And the souls,\" says John, \"of those who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God,\"-understanding what he afterwards says, \"reigned with Christ a thousand years,\"[fn-38-P3862_2124564:54-nf] -that is, the souls of the martyrs not yet restored to their bodies. For the souls of the pious dead are not separated from the Church, which even now is the kingdom of Christ; otherwise there would be no remembrance made of them at the altar of God in the partaking of the body of Christ, nor would it do any good in danger to run to His baptism, that we might not pass from this life without it; nor to reconciliation, if by penitence or a bad conscience any one may be severed from His body. For why are these things practised, if not because the faithful, even though dead, are His members? Therefore, while these thousand years run on, their souls reign with Him, though not as yet in conjunction with their bodies. And therefore in another part of this same book we read, \"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth and now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works do follow them.\"[fn-38-P3863_2125516:55-nf] The Church, then, begins its reign with Christ now in the living and in the dead. For, as the apostle says, \"Christ died that He might be Lord both of the living and of the dead.\"[fn-38-P3864_2125715:56-nf] But he mentioned the souls of the martyrs only, because they who have contended even to death for the truth, themselves principally reign after death; but, taking the part for the whole, we understand the words of all others who belong to the Church, which is the kingdom of Christ.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_18_hymn_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"And who is able, Lord, to tell me up the several succours that are hid in Thee? How shall the parched mouth be able to drink from the Fountain of the Godhead! Answer today the voice of our petition; let our prayer which is in words take effect in deeds. Heal us, O my Master; every time that we see Thy Feast, may it cause rumours that we have heard to pass away. Our mind wanders amid these voices. O Voice of the Father, still [other] voices; the world is noisy, in Thee let it gain itself quiet; for by Thee the sea was stilled from its storms. The devils rejoiced when they heard the voice of blasphemy: let the Watchers rejoice in us as they are wont.[fn-25-P2567_956576:10-nf] From amongst Thy fold there is the voice of sorrowfulness; O Thou that makest all rejoice,[fn-25-P2568_956688:11-nf] let Thy flock rejoice! as for our murmur, O my Master, in it reject us not: our mouth murmurs since it is sinful. Let Thy day, O Lord, give us all manner of joy, with the flowers[fn-25-P2569_956884:12-nf] of peace, let us keep Thy passover. In the day of Thy Ascension we are lifted up:[fn-25-P2570_957031:13-nf] with the new Bread shall be the memorial thereof. O Lord, increase our peace, that we may keep three feasts of the Godhead. Great is Thy day, Lord, let us not be despised. All men honour the day of Thy birth. Thou righteous One, keep Thou the glory of Thy birth; for even Herod honoured the day of His birth! The dances of the impure one pleased the tyrant; to Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women be sweet! Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women please, whose bodies Thou guardest holily. The day of Herod was like him: Thy day too is like Thee! The day of the troubled one was troubled with sin; and fair as Thou art is Thy fair day! The feast of the tyrant killed the preacher; in Thy feast every man preaches glory. On the day of the murderer, the Voice[fn-25-P2571_957815:14-nf] was put to silence; but on Thy day are the voices of the feast. The foul one in his feast put out the Light, that darkness might cover the adulterers. The season of the Holy One trims lamps, that darkness may flee with the hidden things thereof. The day of that fox[fn-25-P2572_958170:15-nf] stank like himself; but holy is the feast of the True Lamb.[fn-25-P2573_958250:16-nf] The day of the transgressor passed[fn-25-P2574_958448:17-nf] away like himself; Thy day like Thyself abideth for ever. The day of the tyrant raged like himself, because with his chain it put to silence the righteous Voice. The feast of the Meek One is tranquil like Himself, because His sum shines upon His persecutors. The tyrant was conscious that He was not a king, therefore to the King of kings he gave place. The whole day, Lord, suffices me not to balance Thy praise with his blame. May Thy Gracious day cause my sin to pass away, seeing that it is with the day of the impure one, that I have weighed Thy day! For great is Thy day beyond comparison! nor can it be compared with our days. The day of man is as of the earthy: the day of God is as of God! Thy day, Lord, is greater than those of the prophets,[fn-25-P2575_959261:18-nf] and I have taken and set it beside that of the murderer! Thou knowest, O Lord, as knowing all things, how to hear the comparison that my tongue hath made. Let Thy day grant our requests for life, since his day granted the request for death. The needy king swore on his feast that half his kingdom should be the reward of the dance! Let Thy feast then, O Thou that enrichest all, shed down in mercy a crumb of fine wheat flour! From the dry land gushed the Fountain, which sufficed to satisfy the thirst of the Gentiles! From the Virgin's womb as from a strong rock sprouted up the seed, whence was much fruit! Barns without number did Joseph fill;[fn-25-P2576_959998:19-nf] and they were emptied and failed in the years of the famine. One true Sheaf gave bread; the bread of Heaven, whereof there is no stint. The bread which the First-born brake in the wilderness,[fn-25-P2577_960209:20-nf] failed and passed away though very good. He returned again and broke the New Bread[fn-25-P2578_960314:21-nf] which ages and generations shall not waste away! The seven loaves also that He brake failed,[fn-25-P2579_960420:22-nf] and the five loaves too that He multiplied were consumed;[fn-25-P2580_960496:23-nf] the Bread that He brake exceeded the world's needs, for the more it was divided, the more it multiplied exceedingly. With much wine also He filled the waterpots; they drew it out, yet it failed though it was abundant: of the Cup that He gave though the draught was small, very great was its strength, so that there is no stint thereto. A Cup is He[fn-25-P2581_960863:24-nf] that contains all strong wines, and also a Mystery in the midst of which He Himself is! The one Bread that He brake has no bound, and the one Cup that He mingled has no stint![fn-25-P2582_961055:25-nf] The Wheat that was sown,[fn-25-P2583_961098:26-nf] on the third day came up and filled the Garner of Life.[fn-25-P2584_961172:27-nf] The spiritual Bread, as the Giver of it, quickens the spiritual spiritually, and he that receives it carnally, receives it rashly to no profit. This Bread of grace let the spirit receive discerningly, as the medicine of Life. If the dead sacrifices in the name of devils were offered,[fn-25-P2585_961477:28-nf] yea eaten, not without a mystery; at the holy thing of the offering, how much more does it behove us that this mystery be circumspectly administered by us.

Light teaches us, in that it makes like unto itself the eye the daughter of the sun: the eye by the light saw the nakedness, and ran and chastely hid the chaste man.[fn-25-P2587_962180:30-nf] As for that nakedness it was wine that made it, which even to the chaste skills not to show mercy!","title":"Hymn III.","author":"Ephraim Syrus"},{"chapter":18,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"23.

For by it our Saviour designed to teach us that, however righteously we live in this life of infirmity and darkness, we still commit sins for the remission of which we ought to pray, while we must pardon those who sin against us that we ourselves also may be pardoned. The Lord then did not utter the words, \"If ye forgive men their trespasses, your Father will also forgive you your trespasses,\"[fn-43-P4312_2355789:101-nf] in order that we might contract from this petition such confidence as should enable us to sin securely from day to day, either putting ourselves above the fear of human laws, or craftily deceiving men concerning our conduct, but in order that we might thus learn not to suppose that we are without sins, even though we should be free from crimes; as also God admonished the priests of the old law to this same effect regarding their sacrifices, which He commanded them to offer first for their own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For even the very words of so great a Master and Lord are to be intently considered. For He does not say, If ye forgive men their sins, your Father will also forgive you your sins, no matter of what sort they be, but He says, your sins; for it was a daily prayer He was teaching, and it was certainly to disciples already justified He was speaking. What, then, does He mean by \"your sins,\" but those sins from which not even you who are justified and sanctified can be free? While, then, those who seek occasion from this petition to indulge in habitual sin maintain that the Lord meant to include great sins, because He did not say, He will forgive you your small sins, but \"your sins,\" we, on the other hand, taking into account the character of the persons He was addressing, cannot see our way to interpret the expression \"your sins\" of anything but small sins, because such persons are no longer guilty of great sins. Nevertheless not even great sins themselves-sins from which we must flee with a total reformation of life-are forgiven to those who pray, unless they observe the appended precept, \"as ye also forgive your debtors.\" For if the very small sins which attach even to the life of the righteous be not remitted without that condition, how much further from obtaining indulgence shall those be who are involved in many great crimes, if, while they cease from perpetrating such enormities, they still inexorably refuse to remit any debt incurred to themselves, since the Lord says, \"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses?\"[fn-43-P4313_2357945:102-nf] For this is the purport of the saying of the Apostle James also, \"He shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy.\"[fn-43-P4314_2358097:103-nf] For we should remember that servant whose debt of ten thousand talents his lord cancelled, but afterwards ordered him to pay up, because the servant himself had no pity for his fellow-servant, who owed him an hundred pence.[fn-43-P4315_2358341:104-nf] The words which the Apostle James subjoins,\"And mercy rejoiceth against judgment,\"[fn-43-P4316_2358448:105-nf] find their application among those who are the children of the promise and vessels of mercy. For even those righteous men, who have lived with such holiness that they receive into the eternal habitations others also who have won their friendship with the mammon of unrighteousness,[fn-43-P4317_2358750:106-nf] became such only through the merciful deliverance of Him who justifies the ungodly, imputing to him a reward according to grace, not according to debt.

And indeed, to tell the truth, I am at a loss to understand the nature of that employment, or, shall I rather say, repose and ease, for it has never come within the range of my bodily senses. And if I should speak of my mind or understanding, what is our understanding in comparison of its excellence? For then shall be that \"peace of God which,\" as the apostle says, \"passeth all understanding,\"[fn-45-P4527_2507528:67-nf] -that is to say, all human, and perhaps all angelic understanding, but certainly not the divine. That it passeth ours there is no doubt; but if it passeth that of the angels,-and he who says \"\"all understanding\" seems to make no exception in their favor, then we must understand him to mean thai neither we nor the angels can understand, as God understands, the peace which God Himself enjoys. Doubtless this passeth all understanding but His own. But as we shall one day be made to participate, according to our slender capacity, in His peace, both in ourselves, and with our neighbor, and with God our chief good, in this respect the angels understand the peace of God in their own measure, and men too, though now far behind them, whatever spiritual advance they have made. For we must remember how great a man he was who said, \"We know in part, and we prophesy in part, until that which is perfect is come;\"[fn-45-P4528_2508458:68-nf] and \"Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.\"[fn-45-P4529_2508548:69-nf] Such also is now the vision of the holy angels, who are also called our angels, because we, being rescued out of the power of darkness, and receiving the earnest of the Spirit, are translated into the kingdom of Christ, and already begin to belong to those angels with whom we shall enjoy that holy and most delightful city of God of which we have now written so much. Thus, then, the angels of God are our angels, as Christ is God's and also ours. They are God's, because they have not abandoned Him; they are ours, because we are their fellow-citizens. The Lord Jesus also said, \"See that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always see the face of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-45-P4530_2509307:70-nf] As, then, they see, so shall we also see; but not yet do we thus see.

But when \"they found not the body (of the Lord Jesus),\"[fn-70-P7052_2044277:1686-nf] \"His sepulture was removed from the midst of them,\"[fn-70-P7053_2044352:1687-nf] according to the prophecy of Isaiah. \"Two angels however, appeared there.\"[fn-70-P7054_2044520:1688-nf] For just so many honorary companions[fn-70-P7055_2044580:1689-nf] were required by the word of God, which usually prescribes \"two witnesses.\"[fn-70-P7056_2044687:1690-nf] Moreover, the women, returning from the sepulchre, and from this vision of the angels, were foreseen by Isaiah, when he says, \"Come, ye women, who return from the vision; \"[fn-70-P7057_2044943:1691-nf] that is, \"come,\" to report the resurrection of the Lord. It was well, however, that the unbelief of the disciples was so persistent, in order that to the last we might consistently maintain that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples as none other than the Christ of the prophets. For as two of them were taking a walk, and when the Lord had joined their company, without its appearing that it was He, and whilst He dissembled His knowledge of what had just taken place,[fn-70-P7058_2045512:1692-nf] they say: \"But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel,\"[fn-70-P7059_2045621:1693-nf] -meaning their own, that is, the Creator's Christ. So far had He been from declaring Himself to them as another Christ! They could not, however, deem Him to be the Christ of the Creator; nor, if He was so deemed by them, could He have tolerated this opinion concerning Himself, unless He were really He whom He was supposed to be. Otherwise He would actually be the author of error, and the prevaricator of truth, contrary to the character of the good; God. But at no time even after His resurrection did He reveal Himself to them as any other than what, on their own showing, they had always thought Him to be. He pointedly[fn-70-P7060_2046270:1694-nf] reproached them: \"O fools, and slow of heart in not believing that which He spake unto you.\"[fn-70-P7061_2046379:1695-nf] By saying this, He proves that He does not belong to the rival god, but to the same God. For the same thing was said by the angels to the women: \"Remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.\"[fn-70-P7062_2046705:1696-nf] \"Must be delivered up; \"and why, except that it was so written by God the Creator? He therefore upbraided them, because they were offended solely at His passion, and because they doubted of the truth of the resurrection which had been reported to them by the women, whereby (they showed that) they had not believed Him to have been the very same as they had thought Him to be. Wishing, therefore, to be believed by them in this wise, He declared Himself to be just what they had deemed Him to be-the Creator's Christ, the Redeemer of lsrµl. But as touching the reality of His body, what can be plainer? When they were doubting whether He were not a phantom-nay, were supposing that He was one-He says to them, \"Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? See[fn-70-P7063_2047508:1697-nf] my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; for a spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-70-P7064_2047729:1698-nf] Now Marcion was unwilling to expunge from his Gospel some statements which even made against him-I suspect, on purpose, to have it in his power from the passages which he did not suppress, when he could have done so, either to deny that he had expunged anything, or else to justify his suppressions, if he made any. But he spares only such passages as he can subvert quite as well by explaining them away as by expunging them from the text. Thus, in the passage before us, he would have the words, \"A spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have,\" so transposed, as to mean, \"A spirit, such as ye see me to be, hath not bones; \"that is to say, it is not the nature of a spirit to have bones. But what need of so tortuous a construction, when He might have simply said, \"A spirit hath not bones, even as you observe that I have not? \"Why, moreover, does He offer His hands and His feet for their examination-limbs which consist of bones-if He had no bones? Why, too, does He add, \"Know that it is I myself,\"[fn-70-P7065_2048760:1699-nf] when they had before known Him to be corporeal? Else, if He were altogether a phantom, why did He upbraid them for supposing Him to be a phantom? But whilst they still believed not, He asked them for some meat,[fn-70-P7066_2048995:1700-nf] for the express purpose of showing them that He had teeth.[fn-70-P7067_2049078:1701-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":18,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_32_similitude_ninth","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"And those from the sixth mountain, which had clefts large and small, and decayed grass in the clefts, who believed, were the following: they who occupy the small clefts are those who bring charges against one another, and by reason of their slanders have decayed in the faith.

For although the arrangement and ordering of things above our nature is obscure to our sense, yet one may more reasonably infer, by the things which we know, that in them too the power of the Spirit works, than that it is banished from the order existing in the things above us. For he who asserts the latter view advances his blasphemy in a naked and unseemly shape, without being able to support his absurd opinion by any argument. But he who agrees that those things which are above us are also ordered by the power of the Spirit with the Father and the Son, makes his assertion on this point with the support of clear evidence from his own life. For[fn-25-P2547_1748185:13-nf] as the nature of man is compounded of body and soul, and the angelic nature has for its portion life without a body, if the Holy Spirit worked only in the case of bodies, and the soul were not capable of receiving the grace that comes from Him, one might perhaps infer from this, if the intellectual and incorporeal nature which is in us were above the power of the Spirit, that the angelic life too was in no need of His grace. But if the gift of the Holy Spirit is principally a grace of the soul, and the constitution of the soul is linked by its intellectuality and invisibility to the angelic life, what person who knows how to see a consequence would not agree, that every intellectual nature is governed by the ordering of the Holy Spirit? For since it is said \"the angels do alway behold the Face of My Father which is in heaven[fn-25-P2548_1749167:14-nf] ,\" and it is not possible to behold the person of the Father otherwise than by fixing the sight upon it through His image; and the image of the person of the Father is the Only-begotten, and to Him again no man can draw near whose mind has not been illumined by the Holy Spirit, what else is shown from this but that the Holy Spirit is not separated from any operation which is wrought by the Father and the Son? Thus the identity of operation in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit shows plainly the undistinguishable character of their substance. So that even if the name of Godhead does indicate nature, the community of substance shows that this appellation is properly applied also to the Holy Spirit. But I know not how these makers-up of all sorts of arguments bring the appellation of Godhead to be an indication of nature, as though they had not heard from the Scripture that it is a matter of appointment[fn-25-P2549_1750100:15-nf] , in which way nature does not arise. For Moses was appointed as a god of the Egyptians, since He Who gave him the oracles, &c., spoke thus to him, \"I have given thee as a god to Pharaoh[fn-25-P2550_1750852:16-nf] .\" Thus the force of the appellation is the indication of some power, either of oversight or of operation. But the Divine nature itself, as it is, remains unexpressed by all the names that are conceived for it, as our doctrine declares. For in learning that He is beneficent, and a judge, good, and just, and all else of the same kind, we learn diversities of His operations, but we are none the more able to learn by our knowledge of His operations the nature of Him Who works. For when one gives a definition of any one of these attributes, and of the nature to which the names are applied, he will not give the same definition of both: and of things of which the definition is different, the nature also is distinct. Indeed the substance is one thing whichno definition has been found to express, and the significance of the names employed concerning it varies, as the names are given from some operation or accident. Now the fact that there is no distinction in the operations we learn from the community of the attributes, but of the difference in respect of nature we find no clear proof, the identity of operations indicating rather, as we said, community of nature. If, then, Godhead is a name derived from operation, as we say that the operation of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one, so we say that the Godhead is one: or if, according to the view of the majority, Godhead is indicative of nature, since we cannot find any diversity in their nature, we not unreasonably define the Holy Trinity to be of one Godhead[fn-25-P2551_1752411:17-nf] .","title":"On the Holy Trinity, and of the Godhead of the Holy Spirit","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":18,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"309","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Malachi: \"Hath not one God created us?

But be that as it may, we believe without hesitation, that both the priests of the Lord and other believers may return to their honours after a proper satisfaction for their error, as the Lord Himself testifies by His prophet: \"Shall he who falls not also rise again? and shall he who turns away not return? \"[fn-90-P9017_2929122:15-nf] And in another passage the Lord says: \"I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he may turn, and live.\"[fn-90-P9018_2929251:16-nf] And the prophet David, on his repentance, said: \"Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy free Spirit.\"[fn-90-P9019_2929416:17-nf] And he indeed, after his repentance, taught others also, and offered sacrifice to God, giving thereby an example to the teachers of the holy Church, that if they have fallen, and thereafter have exhibited a right repentance to God, they may do both things in like manner. For he taught when he said: \"I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto Thee.\"[fn-90-P9020_2929814:18-nf] And he offered sacrifice for himself, while he said: \"The sacrifice for God is a broken spirit.\"[fn-90-P9021_2929928:19-nf] For the prophet, seeing his own transgressions purged by repentance, had no doubt as to healing those of others by preaching, and by making offering to God. Thus the shedding of tears moves the mind's feeling (passionem). And when the satisfaction is made good, the mind is turned aside from anger. For how does that man think that mercy will be shown to himself, who does not forgive his neighbour? If offences abound, then, let mercy also abound; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.[fn-90-P9022_2930467:20-nf] In the Lord's hand there is abundance of all things, because He is the Lord of powers (virtutum) and the King of glory.[fn-90-P9023_2930605:21-nf] For the apostle says: \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, `I say, 'at this time His righteousness, that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\"[fn-90-P9024_2931088:22-nf] And David says: \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.\"[fn-90-P9025_2931204:23-nf] Man, therefore, is cleansed of his sin, and rises again by the grace of God though he has fallen, and abides in his first position, according to the above-cited authorities. Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide in him: \"Go, and sin no more.\"[fn-90-P9026_2931509:24-nf] Whence the apostle says: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

Wherefore a few witnesses, which the Lord deigns to suggest to my mind, I proceed to mention, from out the teaching of Christ concerning humility, such as perhaps may be enough for my purpose. His discourse, the first which He delivered to His disciples at greater length, began from this. \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"[fn-39-P3985_1894979:81-nf] And these without all controversy we take to be humble. The faith of that Centurion He on this account chiefly praised, and said that He had not found in Israel so great faith, because he believed with so great humility as to say, \"I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.\"[fn-39-P3986_1895286:82-nf] Whence also Matthew for no other reason said that he \"came\" unto Jesus, (whereas Luke most plainly signifies that he came not unto Him himself, but sent his friends,) save that by his most faithful humility he himself came unto Him more than they whom he sent. Whence also is that of the Prophet, \"The Lord is very high, and hath respect unto things that are lowly: but what are very high He noteth afar off;\"[fn-39-P3987_1895735:83-nf] assuredly as not coming unto Him. Whence also He saith to that woman of Canaan, \"O woman, great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou wilt;\"[fn-39-P3988_1895903:84-nf] whom above He had called a dog, and had made answer that the bread of the sons was not to be cast to her.

And assuredly the Pharisee was rendering thanks unto God by reason of those things wherein he was greatly self-satisfied. \"I render thanks to Thee,\" saith he, \"that I am not even as the rest of men, unjust, extortioners, adulterers, even as also this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things whatsoever I possess. But the Publican was standing afar off, not daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven, but beating his breast, saying, God be merciful unto me a sinner.\" But there follows the divine judgment, \"Verily I say unto you, the Publican went down from the Temple justified more than that Pharisee.\"[fn-39-P3990_1897144:86-nf] Then the cause is shown, why this is just; \"Forasmuch as he who exalteth himself shall be humbled, and whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.\" Therefore it may come to pass, that each one both shun real evils, and reflect on real goods in himself, and render thanks for these unto \"the Father of lights, from Whom cometh down every best gift, and every perfect gift,\"[fn-39-P3991_1897538:87-nf] and yet be rejected by reason of the sin of haughtiness, if through pride, even in his thought alone, which is before God, he insult other sinners, and specially when confessing their sins in prayer, unto whom is due not upbraiding with arrogance, but pity without despair. What is it that, when His disciples were questioning among themselves, who of them should be greater, He set a little child before their eyes, saying, \"Unless ye shall be as this child, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?\"[fn-39-P3992_1898064:88-nf] Did He not chiefly commend humility, and set in it the desert of greatness? Or when unto the sons of Zebedee desiring to be at His side in lofty seats He so made answer,[fn-39-P3993_1898257:89-nf] as that they should rather think of having to drink the Cup of His Passion, wherein He humbled Himself even unto death, even the death of the Cross,[fn-39-P3994_1898429:90-nf] than with proud desire demand to be preferred to the rest; what did He show, save, that He would be a bestower of exaltation upon them, who should first follow Him as a teacher of humility? And now, in that, when about to go forth unto His Passion, He washed the feet of His disciples, and most openly taught them to do for their fellow-disciples and fellow-servants this, which He their Lord and Master had done for them; how greatly did He commend humility?[fn-39-P3995_1898908:91-nf] And in order to commend this He chose also that time, wherein they were looking on Him, as immediately about to die, with great longing; assuredly about to retain in their memory this especially, which their Master, Whom they were to imitate, had pointed out to them as the last thing.

You at all events heard yesterday how I extolled the power of prayer, how I reproached those who pray with listlessness; without having publicly exposed one of them. Those then who were conscious to themselves of earnestness, accepted that commendation of prayer, and became still more earnest by the praises, while those who were conscious to themselves of listlessness, accepted on the other hand the rebuking, and put off their carelessness. But neither these nor those do we know; and this ignorance is serviceable to both-how, I now tell you. He who has heard the commendations of prayer and is conscious to himself of earnestness, were he to have many witnesses of the commendations, would have lapsed towards pride; but, as it is, by having secretly accepted the praise, he is removed from all arrogance. On the other hand he who is conscious to himself of listlessness, having heard the accusation, has become better from the accusation, as having no one of men a witness of the rebuking; and this was of no ordinary profit to him. For on account of the being flurried at the opinion of the vulgar,[fn-11-P1160_889993:4-nf] so long as we may think that we escape notice in our wickedness, we exert ourselves to become better; but when we have become notorious to all, and have lost the consolation derived from the escaping notice, we grow more shameless and remiss rather. And just as sores become more painful by being unbandaged and frequently exposed to cold air, so also the soul after having sinned, if in the presence of many it be rebuked for what it has done amiss, grows thereby more shameless. In order therefore that this might not take place, the word administered its medicine to you covertly. And that you may understand[fn-11-P1161_890712:5-nf] that the gain which this covert treatment has is great, hear what the Christ says. \"If thy brother have committed a fault against thee convince him of it,\" and he did not say \"between him and the whole town,\" nor, \"between thee and the whole people,\"[fn-11-P1162_891099:6-nf] but \"only between thee and him.\" Let the accusation, he says, be unwitnessed to, in order that the change to amendment may be made easy of digestion. A great good surely, the making the advice unpublished. Sufficient is the conscience, sufficient that incorruptible judge. It is not so much thou who rebukest him who has done wrong as his own conscience (that accuser is the sharper), nor dost thou do it with the more exact knowledge of the faults committed. Add not therefore wound to wound by exposing him who has done wrong; but administer for thyself the counsel unwitnessed. This therefore we are doing now-the very thing that Paul also did, framing the indictment against him who among the Corinthians had sinned without citing of witnesses. And hear how. \"On this account,\" he says, \"brethren, I have applied these figures of speech to myself and Apollos.\" And yet not he himself nor Apollos were they who had rent the people in schism and divided the Church; but all the same he concealed the accusation, and just as by some masks, by hiding the countenances of the defendants by his own and Apollos' names, he afforded them power to amend of that wickedness. And again, \"Lest in some way after I have come God humble me, and I may have to mourn many of those who have before sinned, and have not repented over the uncleanness and lasciviousness which they had committed.\"[fn-11-P1163_892545:7-nf] See how here also he indefinitely mentions those who had sinned, in order that he might not, by openly bringing the accusation, render the soul of those who had sinned more shameless.

For no one is allowed to preside over the assembly of the brethren, or even over himself, before he has not only deprived himself of all his property but has also learnt the fact that he is not his own maker and has no authority over his own actions. For one who renounces the world, whatever property or riches he may possess, must seek the common dwelling of a Coenobium, that he may not flatter himself in any way with what he has forsaken or what he has brought into the monastery. He must also be obedient to all, so as to learn that he must, as the Lord says,[fn-20-P2010_876392:8-nf] become again a little child, arrogating nothing to himself on the score of his age and the number of the years which he now counts as lost while they were spent to no purpose in the world and, as he is only a beginner, and because of the novelty of the apprenticeship, which he knows he is serving in Christ's service, he should not hesitate to submit himself even to his juniors. Further, he is obliged to habituate himself to work and toil, so as to prepare with his own hands; in accordance with the Apostle's command,[fn-20-P2011_876940:9-nf] daily supply of food, either for his own use or for the wants of strangers; and that he may also forget the pride and luxury of his past life, and gain by grinding toil humility of heart. And so no one is chosen to be set over a congregation of brethren before that he who is to be placed in authority has learnt by obedience what he ought to enjoin on those who are to submit to him, and has discovered from the rules of the Elders what he ought to teach to his juniors. For they. say that to rule or to be ruled well needs a wise man, and they call it the greatest gift and grace of the Holy Spirit, since no one can enjoin salutary precepts on those who submit to him but one who has previously been trained in all the rules of virtue; nor can any one obey an Eider but one who has been filled with the love of God and perfected in the virtue of humility. And so we see that there is a variety of rules and regulations in use throughout other districts, because we often have the audacity to preside over a monastery without even having learnt the system of the Elders, and appoint ourselves Abbots before we have, as we ought, professed ourselves disciples, and are readier to require the observance of our own inventions than to preserve the well-tried teaching of our predecessors.

For that sins which have been remitted do return upon a man, where there is no brotherly love, is most clearly taught by our Lord, in the case of the servant whom He found owing Him ten thousand talents, and to whom He yet forgave all at his entreaty. But when he refused to have pity on his fellow-servant who owed him a hundred pence, the Lord commanded him to pay what He had forgiven him. The time, then, at which pardon is received through baptism is as it were the time for rendering accounts, so that all the debts which are found to be due may be remitted. Yet it was not afterwards that the servant lent his fellow-servant the money, which he had so pitilessly exacted when the other was unable to pay it; but his fellow-servant already owed him the debt, when he himself, on rendering his accounts to his master, was excused a debt of so vast an amount. He had not first excused his fellow-servant, and so come to receive forgiveness from his Lord. This is proved by the words of the fellow-servant: \"Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\" Otherwise he would have said, \"You forgave me it before; why do you again demand it?\" This is made more clear by the words of the Lord Himself. For He says, \"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants which was owing[fn-31-P3113_1822915:41-nf] him a hundred pence.\"[fn-31-P3114_1822983:42-nf] He does not say, \"To whom he had already forgiven a debt of a hundred pence.\" Since then He says, \"was owing him,\" it is clear that he had not forgiven him the debt. And indeed it would have been better, and more in accordance with the position of a man who was going to render an account of so great a debt, and expected forbearance from his lord, that he should first have forgiven his fellow-servant what was due to him, and so have come to render the account when there was such need for imploring the compassion of his lord. Yet the fact that he had not yet forgiven his fellow-servant, did not prevent his lord from forgiving him all his debts on the occasion of receiving his accounts. But what advantage was it to him, since they all immediately returned with redoubled force upon his head, in consequence of his persistent want of charity? So the grace of baptism is not prevented from giving remission of all sins, even if he to whom they are forgiven continues to cherish hatred towards his brother in his heart. For the guilt of yesterday is remitted, and all that was before it, nay, even the guilt of the very hour and moment previous to baptism, and during baptism itself.

We therefore charge the Jews with not acknowledging Him to be God, to whom testimony was borne in many passages by the prophets, to the effect that He was a mighty power, and a God next to[fn-80-P8053_1969517:28-nf] the God and Father of all things. For we assert that it was to Him the Father gave the command, when in the Mosaic account of the creation He uttered the words, \"Let there be light,\" and \"Let there be a firmament,\" and gave the injunctions with regard to those other creative acts which were performed; and that to Him also were addressed the words, \"Let Us make man in Our own image and likeness; \"and that the Logos, when commanded, obeyed all the Father's will. And we make these statements not from our own conjectures, but because we believe the prophecies circulated among the Jews, in which it is said of God, and of the works of creation, in express words, as follows: \"He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.\"[fn-80-P8054_1971146:29-nf] Now if God gave the command, and the creatures were formed, who, according to the view of the spirit of prophecy, could He be that was able to carry out such commands of the Father, save Him who, so to speak, is the living Logos and the Truth? And that the Gospels do not consider him who in Jesus said these words, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life,\" to have been of so circumscribed a nature[fn-80-P8055_1971570:30-nf] as to have an existence nowhere out of the soul and body of Jesus, is evident both from many considerations, and from a few instances of the following kind which we shall quote. John the Baptist, when predicting that the Son of God was to appear immediately, not in that body and soul, but as manifesting Himself everywhere, says regarding Him: \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not, who cometh after me.\"[fn-80-P8056_1972020:31-nf] For if he had thought that the Son of God was only there, where was the visible body of Jesus, how could he have said, \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not? \"And Jesus Himself, in raising the minds of His disciples to higher thoughts of the Son of God, says: \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of you.\"[fn-80-P8057_1972401:32-nf] And of the same nature is His promise to His disciples: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8058_1972536:33-nf] And we quote these passages, making no distinction between the Son of God and Jesus. For the soul and body of Jesus formed, after the oi0konomi/a, one being with the Logos of God.

He declares that the infinitely exalted Tetrad descended upon him from the invisible and indescribable places in the form of a woman (for the world could not have borne it coming in its male form), and expounded to him alone its own nature, and the origin of all things, which it had never before revealed to any one either of gods or men. This was done in the following terms: When first the unoriginated, inconceivable Father, who is without material substance,[fn-64-P6439_1502807:174-nf] and is neither male nor female, willed to bring forth that which is ineffable to Him, and to endow with form that which is invisible, He opened His mouth, and sent forth the Word similar to Himself, who, standing near, showed Him what He Himself was, inasmuch as He had been manifested in the form of that which was invisible. Moreover, the pronunciation of His name took place as follows:-He spoke the first word of it, which was the beginning[fn-64-P6440_1503480:175-nf] [of all the rest], and that utterance consisted of four letters. He added the second, and this also consisted of four letters. Next He uttered the third, and this again embraced ten letters. Finally, He pronounced the fourth, which was composed of twelve letters. Thus took place the enunciation of the whole name, consisting of thirty letters, and four distinct utterances. Each of these elements has its own peculiar letters, and character, and pronunciation, and forms, and images, and there is not one of them that perceives the shape of that [utterance] of which it is an element. Neither does any one know[fn-64-P6441_1504380:176-nf] itself, nor is it acquainted with the pronunciation of its neighbour, but each one imagines that by its own utterance it does in fact name the whole. For while every one of them is a part of the whole, it imagines its own sound to be the whole name, and does not leave off sounding until, by its own utterance, it has reached the last letter of each of the elements. This teacher declares that the restitution of all things will take place, when all these, mixing into one letter, shall utter one and the same sound. He imagines that the emblem of this utterance is found in Amen, which we pronounce in concert.[fn-64-P6442_1505071:177-nf] The diverse sounds (he adds) are those which give form to that Aeon who is without material substance and unbegotten, and these, again, are the forms which the Lord has called angels, who continually behold the face of the Father.[fn-64-P6443_1505327:178-nf] ","title":"Book I","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":18,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_58_book_i","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"174","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

All of which things the gospel saying, which uses this figure, shows us that we ought also to observe spiritually; first that whatever has found an entrance into our hearts, and whatever doctrine has been received by us, should be most carefully examined to see whether it has been purified by the divine and heavenly fire of the Holy Ghost, or whether it belongs to Jewish superstition, or whether it comes from the pride of a worldly philosophy and only externally makes a show of religion. And this we can do, if we carry out the Apostle's advice, \"Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God.\"[fn-36-P3616_1344863:64-nf] But by this kind those men also are deceived, who after having been professed as monks are enticed by the grace of style, and certain doctrines of philosophers, which at the first blush, owing to some pious meanings not out of harmony with religion, deceive as with the glitter of gold their hearers, whom they have superficially attracted, but render them poor and miserable for ever, like men deceived by false money made of copper: either bringing them back to the bustle of this world, or enticing them into the errors of heretics, and bombastic conceits: a thing which we read of as happening to Achan in the book of Joshua the son of Nun,[fn-36-P3617_1345527:65-nf] when he coveted a golden weight from the camp of the Philistines, and stole it, and was smitten with a curse and condemned to eternal death. In the second place we should be careful to see that no wrong interpretation fixed on to the pure gold of Scripture deceives us as to the value of the metal: by which means the devil in his craft tried to impose upon our Lord and Saviour as if He was a mere man, when by his malevolent interpretation he perverted what ought to be understood generally of all good men, and tried to fasten it specially on to Him, who had no need of the care of the angels: saying, \"For He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, to keep Thee in all Thy ways: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone,\"[fn-36-P3618_1346334:66-nf] by a skilful assumption on his part giving a turn to the precious sayings of Scripture and twisting them into a dangerous sense, the very opposite of their true meaning, so as to offer to us the image and face of an usurper under cover of the gold colour which may deceive us. Or whether he tries to cheat us with counterfeits, for instance by urging that some work of piety should be taken up which as it does come from the true minds of the fathers, leads under the form of virtue to vice; and, deceiving us either by immoderate or impossible fasts, or by too long vigils, or inordinate prayers, or unsuitable reading, brings us to a bad end. Or, when he persuades us to give ourselves up to mixing in the affairs of others, and to pious visits, by which he may drive us away from the spiritual cloisters of the monastery, and the secrecy of its friendly peacefulness, and suggests that we take on our shoulders the anxieties and cares of religious women who are in want, that when a monk is inextricably entangled in snares of this sort he may distract him with most injurious occupations and cares. Or else when he incites a man to desire the holy office of the clergy under the pretext of edifying many people, and the love of spiritual gain, by which to draw us away from the humility and strictness of our life. All of which things, although they are opposed to our salvation and to our profession, yet when covered with a sort of veil of compassion and religion, easily deceive those who are lacking in skill and care. For they imitate the coins of the true king, because they seem at first full of piety, but are not stamped by those who have the right to coin, i.e., the approved Catholic fathers, nor do they proceed from the head public office for receiving them, but are made by stealth and by the fraud of the devil, and palmed off upon the unskilful and ignorant not without serious harm. And even although they seem to be useful and needful at first, yet if afterwards they begin to interfere with the soundness of our profession, and as it were to weaken in some sense the whole body of our purpose, it is well that they should be cut off and cast away from us like a member which may be necessary, but yet offends us and which seems to perform the office of the right hand or foot. For it is better, without one member of a command, i.e., its working or result, to continue safe and sound in other parts, and to enter as weak into the kingdom of heaven rather than with the whole mass of commands to fall into some error which by an evil custom separates us from our strict rule and the system purposed and entered upon, and leads to such loss, that it will never outweigh the harm that will follow, but will cause all our past fruits and the whole body of our work to be burnt in hell fire.[fn-36-P3619_1349181:67-nf] Of which kind of illusions it is well said in the Proverbs: \"There are ways which seem to be right to a man, but their latter end will come into the depths of hell,\"[fn-36-P3620_1349375:68-nf] and again \"An evil man is harmful when he attaches himself to a good man,\"[fn-36-P3621_1349477:69-nf] i.e., the devil deceives when he is covered with an appearance of sanctity: \"but he hates the sound of the watchman,\"[fn-36-P3622_1349622:70-nf] i.e., the power of discretion which comes from the words and warnings of the fathers.","title":"I.

I do not gainsay it. I do not, however, allow that because the man himself is worse than a heathen, that is, than a Gentile and pagan, therefore whatever the sacrament contains that is Christ's is mingled with his vices and character, and perishes through the corruption of such admixture. For if even those who depart from the Church, and become not the followers but the founders of heresies, have been baptized before their secession, they continue to have baptism, although, according to the above rule, they are worse than heathens; for if on correction they return, they do not receive it, as they certainly would do if they had lost it. It is therefore possible that a man may be worse than a heathen, and yet that the sacrament of Christ may not only be in him, but be not a whit inferior to what it is in a holy and righteous man. For although to the extent of his powers he has not preserved the sacrament, but done it violence in heart and will, yet so far as the sacrament's own nature is concerned, it has remained unhurt in its integrity even in the man who despised and rejected it. Were not the people of Sodom heathens, that is to say, Gentiles? The Jews therefore were worse, to whom the Lord says, \"It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee;\"[fn-41-P4186_2208250:172-nf] and to whom the prophet says, \"Thou hast justified Sodom,\"[fn-41-P4187_2208330:173-nf] that is to say, in comparison with thee Sodom is righteous. Shall we, however, maintain that on this account the holy sacraments which existed among the Jews partook of the nature of the Jews themselves,-those sacraments which the Lord Himself also accepted, and sent the lepers whom He had cleansed to fulfill them,[fn-41-P4188_2208669:174-nf] of which when Zacharias was administering them, the angel stood by him, and declared that his prayer had been heard while be was sacrificing in the temple?[fn-41-P4189_2208847:175-nf] These same sacraments were both in the good men of that time, and in those bad men who were worse than are the heathens, seeing that they were ranked before the Sodomites for wickedness, and yet those sacraments were perfect and holy in both.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_61_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Quinam sunt autem illi \"duo et tres, qui congregantur in nomine Domini, in\" quorum \"medio\" est Dominus?[fn-63-P6357_1943517:111-nf] annon virum et mulierem et filium tres dicit, quoniam mulier cum viro per Deum conjungitur?

Taking all these things, therefore, into consideration, I think that I am not rash in saying that there are some in the house of God after such a fashion as not to be themselves the very house of God, which is said to be built upon a rock,[fn-45-P4540_2275809:142-nf] which is called the one dove,[fn-45-P4541_2275861:143-nf] which is styled the beauteous bride without spot or wrinkle,[fn-45-P4542_2275942:144-nf] and a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed, a well of living water, an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits;[fn-45-P4543_2276097:145-nf] which house also received the keys, and the power of binding and loosing.[fn-45-P4544_2276196:146-nf] If any one shall neglect this house when it arrests and corrects him, the Lord says, \"Let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.\"[fn-45-P4545_2276361:147-nf] Of this house it is said, \"Lord, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thine honor dwelleth;\"[fn-45-P4546_2276503:148-nf] and, \"He maketh men to be of one mind in an house;\"[fn-45-P4547_2276575:149-nf] and, \"I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord;\"[fn-45-P4548_2276698:150-nf] and, \"Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house, O Lord; they will be still praising Thee;\"[fn-45-P4549_2276810:151-nf] with countless other passages to the same effect. This house is also called wheat, bringing forth fruit with patience, some thirty-fold, some sixtyfold, and some an hundredfold.[fn-45-P4550_2277010:152-nf] This house is also in vessels of gold and of silver,[fn-45-P4551_2277101:153-nf] and in precious stones and imperishable woods. To this house it is said, \"Forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;\"[fn-45-P4552_2277296:154-nf] and, \"For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\"[fn-45-P4553_2277377:155-nf] For this house is composed of those that are good and faithful, and of the holy servants of God dispersed throughout the world, and bound together by the unity of the Spirit, whether they know each other personally or not.

Be not ye therefore par-takers with them.\"[fn-85-P8544_2408322:396-nf] And as then the condemnation of sinners extended to others who approved of them, and joined in their society; so also is it the case at present, that \"a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.\"[fn-85-P8545_2408537:397-nf] And as the wrath of God did then descend upon the unrighteous, here also does the apostle likewise say: \"For the wrath of God shall be revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of those men who hold back the truth in unrighteousness.\"[fn-85-P8546_2408815:398-nf] And as, in those times, vengeance came from God upon the Egyptians who were subjecting Israel to unjust punishment, so is it now, the Lord truly declaring, \"And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him? I tell you, that He will avenge them speedily.\"[fn-85-P8547_2409113:399-nf] So says the apostle, in like manner, in the Epistle to the Thessalonians: \"Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled rest with us, at the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ from heaven with His mighty angels, and in a flame of fire, to take vengeance upon those who know not God, and upon those that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall also be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power; when He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all them who have believed in Him.\"[fn-85-P8548_2409791:400-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":18,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_61_book_vi_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"164","folder":"ANF-04","text":"In the next place, as if he had forgotten that it was his object to write against the Christians, he says that, \"having become acquainted with one Dionysius, an Egyptian musician, the latter told him, with respect to magic arts, that it was only over the uneducated and men of corrupt morals that they had any power, while on philosophers they were unable to produce any effect, because they were careful to observe a healthy manner of life.\" If, now, it had been our purpose to treat of magic, we could have added a few remarks in addition to what we have already said on this topic; but since it is only the more important matters which we have to notice in answer to Celsus, we shall say of magic, that any one who chooses to inquire whether philosophers were ever led captive by it or not, can read what has been written by Moiragenes regarding the memoirs of the magician and philosopher Apollonius of Tyana, in which this individual, who is not a Christian, but a philosopher, asserts that some philosophers of no mean note were won over by the magic power possessed by Apollonius, and resorted to him as a sorcerer; and among these, I think, he especially mentioned Euphrates and a certain Epicurean.

As to the honour paid to Seven there are many testimonies, but we will be content with a few out of the many. For instance, seven precious spirits are named; for I think Isaiah[fn-53-P5359_1785494:7-nf] loves to call the activities of the Spirit spirits; and the Oracles of the Lord are purified seven times according to David,[fn-53-P5360_1785634:8-nf] and the just is delivered from six troubles and in the seventh is not smitten.[fn-53-P5361_1785728:9-nf] But the sinner is pardoned not seven times, but seventy times seven.[fn-53-P5362_1785812:10-nf] And we may see it by the contrary also (for the punishment of wickedness is to be praised), Cain being avenged seven times, that is, punishment being exacted from him for his fratricide, and Lamech seventy times seven,[fn-53-P5363_1786053:11-nf] because he was a murderer after the law and the condemnation.[fn-53-P5364_1786133:12-nf] And wicked neighbours receive sevenfold into their bosom;[fn-53-P5365_1789533:13-nf] and the House of Wisdom rests on seven pillars[fn-53-P5366_1789600:14-nf] and the Stone of Zerubbabel is adorned with seven eyes;[fn-53-P5367_1789674:15-nf] and God is praised seven times a day.[fn-53-P5368_1789732:16-nf] And again the barren beareth seven,[fn-53-P5369_1789788:17-nf] the perfect number, she who is contrasted with her who is imperfect in her children.\"[fn-53-P5370_1789893:18-nf] ","title":"Oration XLI.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":18,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"258","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Wherefore thus saith the Lord, Every alien son is uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh\" (that is, unclean in body and soul): \"there shall not enter one of the strangers into the midst of the house of Israel, but the Lerites.\"[fn-70-P7083_2167272:231-nf] He calls those that would not believe, but would disbelieve, strangers. Only those who live purely being true priests of God. Wherefore, of all the circumcised tribes, those anointed to be high priests, and kings, and prophets, were reckoned more holy. Whence He commands them not to touch dead bodies, or approach the dead; not that the body was polluted, but that sin and disobedience were incarnate, and embodied, and dead, and therefore abominable. It was only, then, when a father and mother, a son and daughter died, that the priest was allowed to enter, because these were related only by flesh and seed, to whom the priest was indebted for the immediate cause of his entrance into life. And they purify themselves seven days, the period in which Creation was consummated. For on the seventh day the rest is celebrated; and on the eighth he brings a propitiation, as is written in Ezekiel, according to which propitiation the promise is to be received.[fn-70-P7084_2168258:232-nf] And the perfect propitiation, I take it, is that propitious faith in the Gospel which is by the law and the prophets, and the purity which shows itself in universal obedience, with the abandonment of the things of the world; in order to that grateful surrender of the tabernacle, which results from the enjoyment of the soul. Whether, then, the time be that which through the seven periods enumerated returns to the chiefest rest,[fn-70-P7085_2168712:233-nf] or the seven heavens, which some reckon one above the other; or whether also the fixed sphere which borders on the intellectual world be called the eighth, the expression denotes that the Gnostic ought to rise out of the sphere of creation and of sin. After these seven days, sacrifices are offered for sins. For there is still fear of change, and it touches the seventh circle. The righteous Job says: \"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there; \"[fn-70-P7086_2169228:234-nf] not naked of possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing; but, as a just man, he departs naked of evil and sin, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have led bad lives. For this was what was said, \"Unless ye be converted, and become as children,\"[fn-70-P7087_2169517:235-nf] pure in flesh, holy in soul by abstinence from evil deeds; showing that He would have us to be such as also He generated us from our mother-the water.[fn-70-P7088_2169691:236-nf] For the intent of one generation succeeding another is to immortalize by progress. \"But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.\"[fn-70-P7089_2169843:237-nf] That purity in body and soul which the Gnostic partakes of, the all-wise Moses indicated, by employing repetition in describing the incorruptibility of body and of soul in the person of Rebecca, thus: \"Now the virgin was fair, and man had not known her.\"[fn-70-P7090_2170137:238-nf] And Rebecca, interpreted, means \"glory of God; \"and the glory of God is immortality.[fn-70-P7091_2170244:239-nf] This is in reality righteousness, not to desire other things, but to be entirely the consecrated temple of the Lord. Righteousness is peace of life and a well-conditioned state, to which the Lord dismissed her when He said, \"Depart into peace.\"[fn-70-P7092_2170541:240-nf] For Salem is, by interpretation, peace; of which our Saviour is enrolled King, as Moses says, Melchizedek king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who gave bread and wine, furnishing consecrated food for a type of the Eucharist.

And the Christian will suffer nothing, for \"the angel of the Lord will encamp about them that fear Him, and will deliver them,\"[fn-114-P11402_3111583:78-nf] and his \"angel,\" who \"always beholds the face of his Father in heaven,\"[fn-114-P11403_3111675:79-nf] offers up his prayers through the one High Priest to the God of all, and also joins his own prayers with those of the man who is committed to his keeping. Let not, then, Celsus try to scare us with threats of mischief from demons, for we despise them. And the demons, when despised, can do no harm to those who are under the protection of Him who can alone help all who deserve His aid; and He does no less than set His own angels over His devout servants, so that none of the hostile angels, nor even he who is called \"the prince of this world,\"[fn-114-P11404_3112244:80-nf] can effect anything against those who have given themselves to God.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":18,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_63_book_viii_","source_chapter":71,"source_paragraph":"222","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Celsus, then, as if not observing that he was saying anything inconsistent with the words he had just used, \"if all were to do the same as you,\" adds: \"You surely do not say that if the Romans were, in compliance with your wish, to neglect their customary duties to gods and men, and were to worship the Most High, or whatever you please to call him, that he will come down and fight for them, so that they shall need no other help than his. For this same God, as yourselves say, promised of old this and much more to those who served him, and see in what way he has helped them and you!

But He had made the fulfilment of His promises to depend on certain conditions,-namely, that they should observe and live according to His law; and if the Jews bare not a plot of ground nor a habitation left to them, although they had received these conditional promises, the entire blame is to be laid upon their crimes, and especially upon their guilt in the treatment of Jesus.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":18,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_65_book_v_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Wherefore the Lord says, \"Take My yoke, for it is gentle and light.\"[fn-73-P7372_2227580:74-nf] And on the disciples, striving for the pre-eminence, He enjoins equality with simplicity, saying \"that they must become as little children.\"[fn-73-P7373_2227744:75-nf] Likewise also the apostle writes, that \"no one in Christ is bond or free, or Greek or Jew.

The divine lessons, which we have just heard as they were being read, warn us to gather in a stock of virtues, to fortify a Christian heart, against the offences which were predicted to come, and this from the mercy of the Lord. \"For what is man,\" saith Scripture, \"saving that Thou art mindful of him? \"[fn-43-P4381_1859076:1-nf] \"Woe unto the world because of offences,\"[fn-43-P4382_1859134:2-nf] saith the Lord; the Truth says so; He alarmeth and warneth us, He would not have us to be off our guard; for surely He would not make us desperate. Against this \"woe,\" against this evil, that is, which is to be feared, and dreaded, and guarded against, Scripture counsels, and exhorts, and instructs us in that place, where it is said, \"Great praise have they who love Thy law, and nothing is an offence to them.\"[fn-43-P4383_1859567:3-nf] He hath shown us an enemy to be guarded against, but He hath not omitted to show us also a wall of defence. Thou wast thinking, as thou heardest, \"Woe unto the world because of offences,\" whither thou mightest go beyond the world, that thou mightest not be exposed to offences. Therefore to avoid offences, whither wilt thou go beyond the world, unless thou fly to Him who made the world? And how shall we be able to fly to Him who made the world, unless we give ear to His law which is preached everywhere? And to give ear to it is but a small matter, unless we love it. For divine Scripture in making thee secure against offences doth not say, \"Great peace have they who\" hear \"Thy law. For not the hearers of the law are just before God.[fn-43-P4384_1860326:4-nf] But\" because\" the doers of the law shall be justified,\" and, \"faith worketh by love: \"[fn-43-P4385_1860429:5-nf] it saith, \"Great peace have they who love Thy law, and nothing is an offence to them.\" To this sentiment also agrees the passage which we have chanted in course; \"But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.\"[fn-43-P4386_1860701:6-nf] Because, \"great peace have they who love Thy law.\" For these\" meek \"ones are they who \"love the law of God.\" For, \"Blessed is the man whom Thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the sinner.\"[fn-43-P4387_1861017:7-nf] How diverse seem those words of Scripture, yet into one meaning do they so flow and meet together, that whatsoever out of that most rich fountain thou canst hear, so that thou acquiesce therein, and art in loving harmony with the truth, thou will be at once filled with peace; glowing with love, and fortified against offences.","title":"Sermon XXXI.

But thy wife comes to thee advising thee to some evil thing. Thou dost love her as a wife should be loved; she is one of thy members. \"But if thine eye offend thee, if thine hand offend thee, if thy foot offend thee,\" thou hast just heard the Gospel, \"cut them off, and cast them from thee.\"[fn-43-P4397_1867309:14-nf] Whosoever he be that is dear to thee, whosoever he be that is held in high estimation by thee, let him be so long of high esteem with thee, so long thy beloved member, as he shall not begin to offend time, that is, to advise thee to any evil. Hear now how that this is the meaning of \"offence.\" I have brought forward the example of Job and his wife; but there the word \"offence\" did not occur. Hear the Gospel: when the Lord prophesied of His Passion, Peter began to persuade him not to suffer. \"Get thee behind Me, Satan, thou art an offence to Me.\"[fn-43-P4398_1867885:15-nf] Here undoubtedly the Lord who hath given thee an example of life, hath taught thee both what an \"offence\" is, and how an offence is to be avoided. Him to whom He had a little while before said, \"Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona;\"[fn-43-P4399_1868135:16-nf] He had shown to be His member. But when he begins to be an offence, He cuts off the member; only He restored the member, and put it into its place again. He then will be an \"offence\" to thee, who shall begin to persuade thee to any evil thing. And here, Beloved, take heed; this takes place for the most part not through any evil will, but through a mistaken good will. Thy friend who loves thee, and is loved by thee again, thy father, thy brother, thy child, thy wife, sees thee in an evil case, and would have thee do what is evil. What do I mean by \"sees thee in an evil case\"? Sees thee in some press of trouble. This pressure it may be thou art suffering for righteousness' sake; art suffering it because thou will not give false witness. I would speak merely by way of illustration. Examples abound; for \"woe to the world, because of offences.\" See, for instance, some powerful person, to cover his rapine and plunder, asks of you the service of a false witness. You refuse: refuse the false oath, lest thou shouldest deny Him that is true. That I may not dwell long on this, he is angry, he is powerful, he oppresses thee: a friend comes who would not have thee in this press of trouble, in this evil case; \"I pray thee, do what is told thee; what great matter is it?\" And then perhaps as Satan with the Lord, \"It is written of Thee, He shall give His Angels charge concerning Thee, that Thou dash not Thy foot against a stone.\"[fn-44-P4400_1869592:17-nf] Perhaps too this friend of thine, because he sees thou art a Christian, wishes to persuade thee out of the Law to do what he thinks you ought to do. \"Do what the other tells.\" \"What? Do what the other wishes.\" \"But it is a lie, it is false.\" \"Well, have you not read, `All men are liars'?\"[fn-44-P4401_1869900:18-nf] Now is he an \"offence.\" He is a friend, what will you do? He is an eye, he is a hand: \"Cut it off, and cast it from thee.\" What is, \"cut it off, and cast it from thee\"? Consent not to him. For members in our body make up unity by consent, by consent they live, by consent are joined together one with the other. Where there is dissent, there is disease, or a sore. He is then one of thy members; thou wilt love him. But he is an offence to thee; \"Cut him off, and cast him from thee.\" Consent not to him; drive him off from thine ears, it may be he will return amended.","title":"Sermon XXXI. [LXXXI.

For in one way does that weeping originate which is caused by the pricks of our sins smiting our heart, of which we read: \"I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed; I will water my couch with my tears.\"[fn-49-P4941_1784625:39-nf] And again: \"Let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no rest, and let not the apple of thine eye cease.\"[fn-49-P4942_1784780:40-nf] In another, that which arises from the contemplation of eternal good things and the desire of that future glory, owing to which even richer well-springs of tears burst forth from uncontrollable delights and boundless exultation, while our soul is athirst for the mighty Living God, saying, \"When shall I come and appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-49-P4943_1785188:41-nf] declaring with daily crying and lamentation: \"Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged;\" and: \"Too long hath my soul been a sojourner.\"[fn-49-P4944_1785349:42-nf] In another way do the tears flow forth, which without any conscience of deadly sin, yet still proceed from the fear of hell and the recollection of It hat terrible judgment, with the terror of which the prophet was smitten and prayed to God, saying: \"Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.\"[fn-49-P4945_1785714:43-nf] There is too another kind of tears, which are caused not by knowledge of one's self but by the hardness and sins of others; whereby Samuel is described as having wept for Saul, and both the Lord in the gospel and Jeremiah in former days for the city of Jerusalem, the latter thus saying: \"Oh, that my head were water and mine eyes a fountain of tears! And I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.\"[fn-49-P4946_1786165:44-nf] Or also such as were those tears of which we hear in the hundred and first Psalm: \"For I have eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my cup with weeping.\"[fn-49-P4947_1786340:45-nf] And these were certainty not caused by the same feeling as those which arise in the sixth Psalm from the person of the penitent, but were due to the anxieties of this life and its distresses and losses, by which the righteous who are living in this world are oppressed. And this is clearly shown not only by the words of the Psalm itself, but also by its title, which runs as follows in the character of that poor person of whom it is said in the gospel that \"blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:\"[fn-49-P4948_1786895:46-nf] \"A prayer of the poor when he was in distress and poured forth his prayer to God.\"[fn-49-P4949_1787002:47-nf] ","title":"IX.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.

It is then for our instruction that He put forth this parable, and by this warning He would save us from perishing. \"So,\" said He, \"shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\"[fn-44-P4499_1915148:8-nf] Lo, Brethren, the thing is plain, useful is the admonition, and a wholesome obedience is by all means due, that what hath been bidden may he fulfilled. For every man is at once God's debtor, and hath also some brother a debtor to himself. For who is there who is not God's debtor, but he in whom there can be found no sin? And who is there who hath not a brother his debtor, but he against whom no one hath sinned? Think you that any one among mankind can be found, who is not himself bounden to his brother by some sin? So then every man is a debtor, yet having himself his own debtors too. The righteous God therefore appointeth a rule for thee toward thy debtor, which He also will observe with His. For two works of mercy are there, which deliver us, which the Lord hath Himself briefly laid down in the Gospel: \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: give, and it shall be given unto you.\"[fn-45-P4500_1916059:9-nf] \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven,\" relates to pardoning. \"Give, and it shall be given unto you,\" relates to doing kindnesses. As to what He saith of pardoning, thou both wishest thy sin to be pardoned thee, and thou hast another whom thou mayest pardon. Again, as to the doing kindnesses; a beggar asks of thee, and thou art God's beggar. For we are all when we pray God's beggars; we stand, yea rather we fall prostrate before the door of the Great Householder, we groan in supplication wishing to receive something; and this something is God Himself. What does the beggar ask of thee? Bread. And what dost thou ask of God, but Christ, who saith, \"I am the living Bread which came down from heaven \"?[fn-45-P4501_1916785:10-nf] Would you be forgiven?

But now hear what in so plain a precept I may cause a difficulty. In this question of forgiveness when pardon is asked, and it is due from him who should grant it, it may be a difficulty to us as it was to Peter. \"How often ought I to forgive? Is up to seven times sufficient?\" \"It is not sufficient,\" saith the Lord, \"I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.\"[fn-45-P4503_1917329:11-nf] Now reckon up how often thy brother hath sinned against thee. If thou canst reach the seventy-eighth fault, so as to get beyond the seventy times seven, then set about revenge. Is this then what He really means, and is it really so, that if he shall sin \"seventy times seven,\" thou shouldest forgive him; but if he shall sin seventy times and eight, it should then be lawful for thee not to forgive? Nay I am bold to say, that if he should even sin seventy-eight times, thou must forgive. Yea, as I have said, if he shall sin seventy-eight times, forgive. And if he sin a hundred times, forgive. And why need I say, so and so often? In one word,[fn-45-P4504_1918001:12-nf] as often as he shall sin, forgive him. Have I then taken upon me to overpass the measure of my Lord? He fixed the limit of forgiveness in the number seventy-seven; shall I presume to overleap this limit? It is not so, I have not presumed to go at all beyond. I have heard the Lord Himself speaking in His Apostle where there is no measure or number fixed. For He says, \"Forgiving one another,if any man have a quarrel against any, as God in Christ hath forgiven you.\"[fn-45-P4505_1918507:13-nf] Here you have the rule. If Christ have forgiven thee thy sins \"seventy times and seven\" only, if He have pardoned up to this point, and refused to pardon beyond it; then do thou also fix this limit, and be loth to forgive beyond it. But if Christ hath found thousands of sins upon sins, and hath yet forgiven all; withdraw not then thy mercy, but ask the forgiveness of that large number. For it was not without a meaning that the Lord said \"seventy times seven;\" forasmuch as there is no trespass whatever which thou oughtest not to forgive. See this servant in the parable, who being a debtor was found to have a debtor, owed ten thousand talents. And I suppose that ten thousand talents are at least ten thousand sins. For I will not say how but one talent will include all sins. But how much did the other servant owe him? He owed a hundred denarii. Now is not this more than \"seventy and seven\"? And yet the Lord was wroth, because he did not forgive him. For not only is a hundred more than \"seventy-seven;\" but a hundred denarii, perhaps are a thousand\" asses.\" But what was this to ten thousand talents?","title":"Sermon XXXIIL [LXXXIII.

Consider then, Brethren; every man begins from Baptism; he goes out free, the \"ten thousand talents\" are forgiven him; and when he goes out, he will soon find some fellow-servant his debtor. Let him note then, what sin itself is;[fn-45-P4516_1923707:20-nf] for the number eleven is the transgression of the law. For the law is ten, sin eleven. For the law is denoted by ten, sin by eleven. Why is sin denoted by eleven? Because to get to eleven, there is the transgression of the ten.[fn-45-P4517_1923970:21-nf] But the due limit is fixed in the law; and the transgression of it is sin. Now when you have passed beyond the ten, you come to eleven. This high mystery was figured out when the tabernacle was commanded to be built. There are many things mentioned there in number, which are a great mystery.[fn-45-P4518_1924307:22-nf] Among the rest, curtains of haircloth were ordered to be made not ten, but eleven;[fn-45-P4519_1924416:23-nf] because by haircloth is signified the confession of sins. Now what do you require more? Would you know how that all sins are contained in tiffs number \"seventy-seven\"? Seven then is usually put for a whole; because in seven days the revolution of time is completed, and when the seventh is ended, it returns to the first again, that the same revolution may be continued. In such revolutions whole ages pass away: yet there is no departure from the number seven. For He spoke of all sins, when He said \"seventy times seven;\" for multiply that eleven seven times, and it makes seventy-seven. Therefore would He have all sins forgiven, for He marked them out by the number\" seventy-seven.\" Let no one then retain against himself by refusing to forgive, lest it be retained against him, when he prayeth. For God saith, \"Forgive, and thou shalt be forgiven.\" For I have forgiven thee first; do thou at least forgive after that. For if thou wilt not forgive, I will call thee back, and put upon thee again all that I had remitted to thee. For the Truth doth not speak falsely; Christ neither deceiveth, nor is deceived, and He hath said at the close of the parable, \"So likewise shall your Father which is in heaven do unto you.\"[fn-45-P4520_1925687:24-nf] Thou findest a Father, imitate thy Father. For if thou wilt not imitate Him, thou art devising[fn-45-P4521_1925804:25-nf] to be disinherited. \"So likewise\" then \"shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\" Say not with the tongue, \"I forgive,\" and put off to forgive in the heart; for by His threat of vengeance God showeth thee thy punishment. God knoweth where thou speakest. Man can hear thy voice; God looketh into thy conscience. If thou sayest, I forgive; forgive. Better is it that thou shouldest be violent in words, and forgive in the heart, than in words be soft, and in the heart relentless.","title":"Sermon XXXIIL [LXXXIII.

Listen also to what I have to say on this other expression which has been adduced, viz., \"Christ, who redeemed us from the curse of the law.\"[fn-35-P3544_971877:275-nf] My view of this passage is that Moses, that illustrious servant of God, committed to those who wished to have the right vision,[fn-35-P3545_972026:276-nf] an emblematic[fn-35-P3546_972130:277-nf] law, and also a real law. Thus, to take an example, after God had made the world, and all things that are in it, in the space of six days, He rested on the seventh day from all His works by which statement I do not mean to affirm that He rested because He was fatigued, but that He did so as having brought to its perfection every creature which He had resolved to introduce. And yet in the sequel it, the new law, says: \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-35-P3547_973554:278-nf] Does that mean, then, that He is still making heaven, or sun, or man, or animals, or trees, or any such thing? Nay; but the meaning is, that when these visible objects were perfectly finished, He rested from that kind of work; while, however, He still continues to work at objects invisible with an inward mode of action,[fn-35-P3548_973895:279-nf] and saves men. In like manner, then, the legislator desires also that every individual amongst us should be devoted unceasingly to this kind of work, even as God Himself is; and he enjoins us consequently to rest continuously from secular things, and to engage in no worldly sort of work whatsoever; and this is called our Sabbath. This also he added in the law, that nothing senseless[fn-35-P3549_974390:280-nf] should be done but that we should be careful and direct our life in accordance with what is just and righteous. Now this law was suspended over men, discharging most sharply its curse against those who might transgress it. But because its subjects, too, were but men, and because, as happens also frequently I with us, controversies arose and injuries were inflicted, the law likewise at once, and with the severest equity, made any wrong that was done return upon the head of the wrong-doer;[fn-35-P3550_974964:281-nf] so that, for instance, if a poor man was minded to gather a bundle of wood upon the Sabbath, he was placed under the curse of the law, and exposed to the penality of instant death.[fn-35-P3551_975286:282-nf] The men, therefore, who had been brought up with the Egyptians were thus severely pressed by the restrictive power of the law, and they were unable to bear the penalties and the curses of the law. But, again, He who is ever the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, came and delivered those men from these pains and curses of the law, forgiving them their offences. And He indeed did not deal with them as Moses did, putting the severities of the law in force, and granting indulgence to no man for any offence; but He declared that if any man suffered an injury at the hands of his neighbour, he was to forgive him not once only, nor even twice or thrice, nor only seven times, but even unto seventy times seven;[fn-35-P3552_976014:283-nf] but that, on the other hand, if after all this the offender still continued to do such wrong, he ought then, as the last resource, to be brought under the law of Moses, and that no further pardon should be granted to the man who would thus persist in wrong-doing, even after having been forgiven unto seventy times seven. And He bestowed His forgiveness not only on a transgressor of such a character as that, but even on one who did offence to the Son of man. But if a man dealt thus with the Holy Spirit, He made him subject to two curses,-namely, to that of the law of Moses, and to that of His own law; to the law of Moses in truth in this present life, but to His own law at the time of the judgment: for His word is this: \"It shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.\"[fn-35-P3553_976851:284-nf] There is the law of Moses, thus, that in this world gives pardon to no such person; and there is the law of Christ that punishes in the future world. From this, therefore, mark how He confirms the law, not only not destroying it, but fulfilling it. Thus, then, He redeemed them from that curse of the law which belongs to the present life; and from this fact has come the appellation \"the curse of the law.\" This is the whole account which needs be given of that mode of speech. But, again, why the law is called the \"strength of sin, we shall at once explain in brief to the best of our ability. Now it is written that \"the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners.\"[fn-35-P3554_977606:285-nf] In these times, then, before Moses, there was no written law for transgressors; whence also Pharaoh, not knowing the strength of sin, transgressed in the way of afflicting the children of Israel with unrighteous burdens, and despised the Godhead, not only himself, but also all who were with him. But, not to make any roundabout statement, I shall explain the matter briefly as follows. There were certain persons of the Egyptian race mingling with the people of Moses, when that people was under his rule in the desert; and when Moses had taken his position on the mount, with the purpose of receiving the law, the impatient people, I do not mean those who were the true Israel, but those who had been intermixed with the Egyptians,[fn-35-P3555_978360:286-nf] set up a calf as their god, in accordance with their ancient custom of worshipping idols, with the notion that by such means they might secure themselves against ever having to pay the proper penalties for their iniquities.[fn-35-P3556_979141:287-nf] Thus were they altogether ignorant of the strength of their sin. But when Moses returned (from the mount) and found that out, he issued orders that those men should be put to death with the sword. From that occasion a beginning was made ill the correct perception of the strength of sin on the part of these persons through the instrumentality of the law of Moses, and for that reason the law has been called the \"strength of sin.\"","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":18,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_56_homily_xii_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Then Peter answered, \"The prophet of the truth has said, `Good things must needs come, and blessed, said he, is he by whom they come; in like manner evil things must needs come, but woe to him through whom they come.'[fn-48-P4811_1424419:10-nf] But if evil things come by means of evil men, and good things are brought by good men, it must needs be in each man as his own to be either good or bad, and proceeding from what he has proposed, in order to the coming of the subsequent good or evil,[fn-48-P4812_1424731:11-nf] which, being of his own choice, are not arranged by the providence of God to come from him.

But readers, gifted with greater curiosity, are naturally inclined to probe into the question further. How, they ask, can justice be satisfied seven times? And what are the vengeances? Are they for seven sins committed? Or is the sin committed once and are there seven punishments for the one sin? Scripture continually assigns seven as the number of the remission of sins. \"How often,\" it is asked, \"shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?\" (It is Peter who is speaking to the Lord.) \"Till seven times?\" Then comes the Lord's answer, \"I say not unto thee, until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.\"[fn-58-P5856_1837625:5-nf] Our Lord did not vary the number, but multiplied the seven, and so fixed the limit of the forgiveness. After seven years the Hebrew used to be freed from slavery.[fn-58-P5857_1837811:6-nf] Seven weeks of years used in old times to make the famous jubilee,[fn-58-P5858_1837894:7-nf] in which the land rested, debts were remitted, slaves were set free, and, as it were, a new life began over again, the old life from age to age being in a sense completed at the number seven. These things are types of this present life, which revolves in seven days and passes by, wherein punishments of slighter sins are inflicted, according to the loving care of our good Lord, to save us from being delivered to punishment in the age that has no end. The expression seven times is therefore introduced because of its connexion with this present world for men who love this world ought specially to be punished in the things for the sake of which they have chosen to live wicked lives. If you understand the vengeances to be for the sins committed by Cain, you will find those sins to be seven. Or if you understand them to mean the sentence passed on him by the Judge, you will not go far wrong. To take the crimes of Cain: the first sin is envy at the preference of Abel; the second is guile, whereby he said to his brother, \"Let us go into the field:\"[fn-58-P5859_1838968:8-nf] the third is murder, a further wickedness: the fourth, fratricide, a still greater iniquity: the fifth that he committed the first murder, and set a bad example to mankind: the sixth wrong in that he grieved his parents: the seventh, his lie to God; for when he was asked, \"Where is Abel thy brother?\" he replied, \"I know not.\"[fn-58-P5860_1839311:9-nf] Seven sins were therefore avenged in the destruction of Cain. For when the Lord said, \"Cursed is the earth which has opened to receive the blood of thy brother,\" and \"groaning and trembling shall there be on the earth,\" Cain said, \"If thou castest me out to-day from the earth, then from thy face shall I be hid, and groaning and trembling shall I lie upon the earth, and every one that findeth me shall slay me.\" It is in answer to this that the Lord says, \"Whosoever slayeth Cain will discharge seven vengeances.\"[fn-58-P5861_1839843:10-nf] Cain supposed that he would be an easy prey to every one, because of there being no safety for him in the earth (for the earth was cursed for his sake), and of his being deprived of the succour of God, Who was angry with him for the murder, and so of there being no help for him either from earth or from heaven. Therefore he said, \"It shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me.\" Scripture proves his error in the words, \"Not so;\" i.e. thou shall not be slain. For to men suffering punishment, death is a gain, because it brings relief from their pain. But thy life shall be prolonged, that thy punishment may be made commensurate with thy sins. Since then the word e0kdikou/menon may be understood in two senses; both the sin for which vengeance was taken, and the manner of the punishment, let us now examine whether the criminal suffered a sevenfold torment.","title":"Letter CCLX.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":18,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_306_letter_cclxxxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Further, let proclamation be made throughout the district, that he be excluded from participation in any of the ordinary relations of life; so that by our withholding ourselves from all intercourse with him he may become altogether food for the devil.[fn-61-P6164_1921959:2-nf] ","title":"Letter CCLXXXVIII.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":18,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_40_letter_xxii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3.

No one ought to cherish a grudge against the sinner who repents, but heartily to forgive him.[fn-29-P2942_965744:47-nf] He who says that he has repented of a sin ought not only to be pricked with compunction for his sin, but also to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.[fn-29-P2943_965917:48-nf] He who has been corrected in first faults, and received pardon, if he sins again prepares for himself a judgment of wrath worse than the former.[fn-29-P2944_966079:49-nf] He, who after the first and second admonition[fn-29-P2945_966146:50-nf] abides in his fault, ought to be brought before the person in authority,[fn-29-P2946_966238:51-nf] if haply after being rebuked by more he may be ashamed.[fn-29-P2947_966420:52-nf] If even thus he fail to be set right he is to be cut off from the rest as one that maketh to offend, and regarded as a heathen and a publican,[fn-29-P2948_966584:53-nf] for the security of them that are obedient, according to the saving, When the impious fall the righteous tremble.[fn-29-P2949_966720:54-nf] He should be grieved over as a limb cut from the body. The sun ought not to go down upon a brother's wrath,[fn-29-P2950_966854:55-nf] lest haply night come between brother and brother, and make the charge stand in the day of judgment. A Christian ought not to wait for an opportunity for his own amendment,[fn-29-P2951_967045:56-nf] because there is no certainty about the morrow; for many after many devices bare not reached the morrow.
