{"verses":["The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out\nearly in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.","And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent\nthem into his vineyard.","And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the\nmarketplace idle.","And he said to them:  Go you also into my vineyard, and I will\ngive you what shall be just.","And they went their way.  And again he went out about the sixth\nand the ninth hour, and did in like manner.","But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others\nstanding, and he saith to them:  Why stand you here all the day idle?","They say to him:  Because no man hath hired us.  He saith to them:\nGo ye also into my vineyard.","And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his\nsteward:  Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the\nlast even to the first.","When therefore they were come that came about the eleventh hour,\nthey received every man a penny.","But when the first also came, they thought that they should\nreceive more:  And they also received every man a penny.","And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,","Saying:  These last have worked but one hour.  and thou hast made\nthem equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.","But he answering said to one of them:  friend, I do thee no\nwrong:  didst thou not agree with me for a penny?","Take what is thine, and go thy way:  I will also give to this\nlast even as to thee.","Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will?  Is thy eye evil,\nbecause I am good?","So shall the last be first and the first last.  For many are\ncalled but few chosen.","And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart\nand said to them:","Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be\nbetrayed to the chief priests and the scribes:  and they shall condemn\nhim to death.","And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged\nand crucified:  and the third day he shall rise again.","Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her\nsons, adoring and asking something of him.","Who said to her:  What wilt thou?  She saith to him:  say that\nthese my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on\nthy left, in thy kingdom.","And Jesus answering, said:  You know not what you ask.  Can you\ndrink the chalice that I shall drink?  They say to him:  We can.","He saith to them:  My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit\non my right or left hand is not mine to give to you, but to them for\nwhom it is prepared by my Father.","And the ten, hearing it, were moved with indignation against the\ntwo brethren.","But Jesus called them to him and said:  You know that the princes\nof the Gentiles lord it over them; and that they that are the greater,\nexercise power upon them.","It shall not be so among you:  but whosoever is the greater among\nyou, let him be your minister.","And he that will be first among you shall be your servant.","Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to\nminister and to give his life a redemption for many.","And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed\nhim.","And behold two blind men sitting by the way side heard that\nJesus passed by.  And they cried out, saying:  O Lord, thou son of David,\nhave mercy on us.","And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their\npeace.  But they cried out the more, saying:  O Lord, thou son of David,\nhave mercy on us.","And Jesus stood and called them and said:  What will ye that I do\nto you?","They say to him:  Lord, that our eyes be opened.","And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes.  And\nimmediately they saw and followed him."]}
