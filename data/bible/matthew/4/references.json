What brings you, a solitary, into the throng of men? The advice that I give is that of no inexperienced mariner who has never lost either ship or cargo, and has never known a gale. Lately shipwrecked as I have been myself, my warnings to other voyagers spring from my own fears. On one side, like Charybdis, self-indulgence sucks into its vortex the soul's salvation. On the other, like Scylla, lust, with a smile on her girl's face, lures it on to wreck its chastity. The coast is savage, and the devil with a crew of pirates carries irons to fetter his captives. Be not credulous, be not over-confident.The sea may be as smooth and smiling as a pond, its quiet surface may be scarcely ruffled by a breath of air, yet sometimes its waves are as high as mountains. There is danger in its depths, the foe is lurking there. Ease your sheets, spread your sails, fasten the cross as an ensign on your prow. The calm that you speak of is itself a tempest. \"Why so?\" you will perhaps argue; \"are not all my fellow-townsmen Christians?\" Your case, I reply, is not that of others. Listen to the words of the Lord: \"If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come and follow me.\"[fn-4-P414_76063:208-nf] You have already promised to be perfect. For when you forsook the army and made yourself an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven's sake,[fn-4-P415_76218:209-nf] you did so that you might follow the perfect life. Now the perfect servant of Christ has nothing beside Christ. Or if he have anything beside Christ he is not perfect. And if he be not perfect when he has promised God to be so, his profession is a lie. But \"the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.\"[fn-4-P416_76538:210-nf] To conclude, then, if you are perfect you will not set your heart on your father's goods; and if you are not perfect you have deceived the Lord. The Gospel thunders forth its divine warning: \"Ye cannot serve two masters,\"[fn-4-P417_76780:211-nf] and does any one dare to make Christ a liar by serving at once both God and Mammon? Repeatedly does He proclaim, \"If any one will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"[fn-4-P418_77004:212-nf] If I load myself with gold can I think that I am following Christ?

In the use of this passage, however, we must be very specially on our guard, lest perchance, when we see any servant of God making provision that such necessaries shall not be wanting either to himself or to those with whose care he has been entrusted, we should decide that he is acting contrary to the Lord's precept, and is anxious for the morrow.[fn-8-P845_318746:168-nf] For the Lord Himself also, although angels ministered to Him,[fn-8-P846_319396:169-nf] yet for the sake of example, that no one might afterwards be scandalized when he observed any of His servants procuring such necessaries, condescended to have money bags, out of which whatever might be required for necessary uses might be provided; of which bags, as it is written, Judas, who betrayed Him, was the keeper and the thief.[fn-8-P847_319754:170-nf] In like manner, the Apostle Paul also may seem to have taken thought for the morrow, when he said: \"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the saints of Galatia, even so do ye: upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store[fn-8-P848_320056:171-nf] what shall seem good unto him, that there be no gatherings when I conic.

And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.\"[fn-8-P850_320744:173-nf] In the Acts of the Apostles also it is written, that such things as are necessary for food were provided for the future, on account of an impending famine. For we thus read: \"And in these days came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch,[fn-8-P851_321007:174-nf] and there was great rejoicing. And when we were gathered together,[fn-8-P852_321158:175-nf] there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every one according to his ability, determined to send relief to the elders for the brethren which dwelt in Judaea, which also they did by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.\"[fn-8-P853_321614:176-nf] And in the case of the necessaries presented to him, wherewith the same Apostle Paul when setting sail was laden,[fn-8-P854_321818:177-nf] food seems to have been furnished for more than a single day. And when the same apostle writes, \"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working[fn-8-P855_322008:178-nf] with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth;\"[fn-8-P856_322131:179-nf] to those who misunderstand him he does not seem to keep the Lord's precept, which runs, \"Behold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;\" and, \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;\" while he enjoins the parties in question to labour, working with their hands, that they may have something which they may be able to give to others also. And in what he often says of himself, that he wrought with his hands that he might not be burdensome;[fn-8-P857_322756:180-nf] and in what is written of him, that he joined himself to Aquila on account of the similarity of their occupation, in order that they might work together at that from which they might make a living;[fn-8-P858_322994:181-nf] he does not seem to have imitated the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. From these and such like passages of Scripture, it is sufficiently apparent that our Lord does not disapprove of it, when one looks after such things in the ordinary way that men do; but only when one enlists as a soldier of God for the sake of such things, so that in what he does he fixes his eye not on the kingdom of God, but on the acquisition of such things.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_100_the_canonical_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-06","text":"But since the fourth passover of the persecution has arrived, it is sufficient, in the case of those who have been apprehended and thrown into prison, and who have sustained torments not to be borne,[fn-43-P4328_1291148:3-nf] and stripes intolerable, and many other dreadful afflictions, and afterwards have been betrayed by the frailty of the flesh, even though they were not at the first received On account of their grievous fall that followed yet because they contended sorely and resisted long; for they did not come to this of their own will, but were betrayed by the frailty of the flesh for they show in their bodies the marks of Jesus,[fn-43-P4329_1291628:4-nf] and some are now, for the third year, bewailing their fault: it is sufficient, I say, that from the time of their submissive approach, other forty days should be enjoined upon them, to keep them in remembrance of these things; those forty days during which, though our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ had fasted, He was yet, after He had been baptized, tempted of the devil.

It is, of course, the soul, made after the image of God, which has this high honour; an honour which no length of sinful ancestry can forfeit, for each soul is still separately created. Hence no human soul is akin to any other human soul; the uniformity of type is secured by each being made in the same pattern, and the dignity of humanity by the fact that this pattern is that of the Son, the Image of God. But the soul pervades the whole body with which it is associated, even as God pervades the universe[fn-4-P493_358985:313-nf] . The soul of each man is individual, special to himself; his brotherhood with mankind belongs to him through his body, which has therefore something of universality. Hence the relation of mankind with Christ is not through his human soul; it was 'the nature of universal flesh' which He took[fn-4-P494_359314:314-nf] that has made Him one with us in the Incarnation and in the Eucharist[fn-4-P495_359534:315-nf] . The reality of His body, as we have seen, is amply secured by Hilary; its universality is assured by the absence of any individual human paternity, which would have isolated Him from others[fn-4-P496_359781:316-nf] . Thus He took all humanity into His one body; He is the Church[fn-4-P497_359954:317-nf] , for He contains her through the mystery of His body. In Him, by the same means, 'there is contained the congregation, so to speak, of the whole race of men.' Hence He spoke of Himself as the City set on a hill; the inhabitants are mankind[fn-4-P498_360222:318-nf] . But Christ not only embraces all humanity in Himself, but the archetype after Whom, and the final cause for Whom, man was made. Every soul, when it proceeds from the hands of God, is pure, free and immortal, with a natural affinity and capacity for good[fn-4-P499_360711:319-nf] , which can find its satisfaction only in Christ, the ideal Man.

Hence the relation of mankind with Christ is not through his human soul; it was 'the nature of universal flesh' which He took[fn-4-P494_359314:314-nf] that has made Him one with us in the Incarnation and in the Eucharist[fn-4-P495_359534:315-nf] . The reality of His body, as we have seen, is amply secured by Hilary; its universality is assured by the absence of any individual human paternity, which would have isolated Him from others[fn-4-P496_359781:316-nf] . Thus He took all humanity into His one body; He is the Church[fn-4-P497_359954:317-nf] , for He contains her through the mystery of His body. In Him, by the same means, 'there is contained the congregation, so to speak, of the whole race of men.' Hence He spoke of Himself as the City set on a hill; the inhabitants are mankind[fn-4-P498_360222:318-nf] . But Christ not only embraces all humanity in Himself, but the archetype after Whom, and the final cause for Whom, man was made. Every soul, when it proceeds from the hands of God, is pure, free and immortal, with a natural affinity and capacity for good[fn-4-P499_360711:319-nf] , which can find its satisfaction only in Christ, the ideal Man. But if Christ is thus everything to man, humanity has also, in the foreordained purpose of God. something to confer upon Christ. The temporary humiliation of the Incarnation has for its result a higher glory than He possessed before[fn-5-P500_361063:320-nf] , acquired through the harmony of the two natures.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_03_introduction","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"Hilary is not content with setting a standard which his flock must strive to reach.

Because that deceiver then,-who was a mediator to death for man, and feignedly puts himself forward as to life, under the name of cleansing by sacrilegious rites and sacrifices, by which the proud are led away, -can neither share in our death, nor rise again from his own: he has indeed been able to apply his single death to our double one; but he certainly has not been able to apply a single resurrection, which should be at once a mystery of our renewal, and a type of that waking up which is to be in the end. He then who being alive in the spirit raised again His own flesh that was dead, the true Mediator of life, has cast out him, who is dead in the spirit and the mediator of death, from the spirits of those who believe in Himself, so that he should not reign within, But should assault from without, and yet not prevail. And to him, too, He offered Himself to be tempted, in order that He might be also a mediator to overcome his temptations, not only by succor, but also by example. But when the devil, from the first, although striving through every entrance to creep into His inward parts, was thrust out, having finished all his alluring temptation in the wilderness after the baptism;[fn-9-P923_353883:75-nf] because, being dead in the spirit, he forced no entrance into Him who was alive in the spirit, he betook himself, through eagerness for the death of man in any way whatsoever, to effecting that deathwhich he could, and was permitted to effect it upon that mortal element which the living Mediator had received from us. And where he could do anything, there in every respect he was conquered; and wherein he received outwardly the power of slaying the Lord in the flesh, therein his inward power, by which he held ourselves, was slain. For it was brought to pass that the bonds of many sins in many deaths were loosed, through the one death of One which no sin had preceded. Which death, though not due, the Lord therefore rendered for us, that the death which was due might work us no hurt. For He was not stripped of the flesh by obligation of any authority, but He stripped Himself. For doubtless He who was able not to die, if He would not, did die because He would: and so He made a show of principalities and powers, openly triumphing over them in Himself.[fn-9-P924_354965:76-nf] For whereas by His death the one and most real sacrifice was offered up for us, whatever fault there was, whence principalities and powers held us fast as of right to pay its penalty, He cleansed, abolished, extinguished; and by His own resurrection He also called us whom He predestinated to a new life; and whom He called, them He justified; and whom He justified, them He glorified.[fn-9-P925_355369:77-nf] And so the devil, in that very death of the flesh, lost man, whom he was possessing as by an absolute right, seduced as he was by his own consent, and over whom he ruled, himself impeded by no corruption of flesh and blood, through that frailty of man's mortal body, whence he was both too poor and too weak; he who was proud in proportion as he was, as it were, both richer and stronger, ruling over him who was, as it were, both clothed in rags and full of troubles. For whither he drove the sinner to fall, himself not following, there by following he compelled the Redeemer to descend. And so the Son of God deigned to become our friend in the fellowship of death, to which because he came not, the enemy thought himself to be better and greater than ourselves. For our Redeemer says, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"[fn-9-P926_356262:78-nf] Wherefore also the devil thought himself superior to the Lord Himself, inasmuch as the Lord in His sufferings yielded to him; for of Him, too, is understood what is read in the Psalm, \"For Thou hast made Him a little lower than the angels:\"[fn-9-P927_356521:79-nf] so that He, being Himself put to death, although innocent, by the unjust one acting against us as it were by just right, might by a most just right overcome him, and so might lead captive the captivity wrought through sin,[fn-9-P928_356762:80-nf] and free us from a captivity that was just on account of sin, by blotting out the handwriting, and redeeming us who were to be justified although sinners, through His own righteous blood unrighteously poured out.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"198","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"11 Do thou therefore persuade themultitude not to be led astray concerning Jesus.

These two angelic communities, then, dissimilar and contrary to one another, the one both by nature good and by will upright, the other also good by nature but by will depraved, as they are exhibited in other and more explicit passages of holy writ, so I think they are spoken of in this book of Genesis under the names of light and darkness; and even if the author perhaps had a different meaning, yet our discussion of the obscure language has not been wasted time; for, though we have been unable to discover his meaning, yet we have adhered to the rule of faith, which is sufficiently ascertained by the faithful from other passages of equal authority. For, though it is the material works of God which are here spoken of, they have certainly a resemblance to the spiritual, so that Paul can say, \"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.\"[fn-19-P1961_1120647:76-nf] If, on the other hand, the author of Genesis saw in the words what we see, then our discussion reaches this more satisfactory conclusion, that the man of God, so eminently and divinely wise, or rather, that the Spirit of God who by him recorded God's works which were finished on the sixth day, may be supposed not to have omitted all mention of the angels whether he included them in the words \"in the beginning,\" because He made them first, or, which seems most likely, because He made them in the only-begotten Word. And, under these names heaven and earth, the whole creation is signified, either as divided into spiritual and material, which seems the more likely, or into the two great parts of the world in which all created things are contained, so that, first of all, the creation is presented in sum, and then its parts are enumerated according to the mystic number of the days.","title":"Book XI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Now, if there has been temerity in our retracing to primordial experiences the reasons for God's having laid, and our duty (for the sake of God) to lay, restrictions upon food, let us consult common conscience.

Since nether was it unnatural[fn-12-P1298_442216:11-nf] for them to follow Him at the beginning, and then leave Him again and return anew to their own craft, when they saw both John thrown into prison, and Himself departing. Accordingly you see that He finds them actually fishing. But He neither forbad them at the first when minded to withdraw, nor having withdrawn themselves, did He let them go altogether; but He gave way when they started aside from Him, and comes again to win them back; which kind of thing is the great point in fishing.[fn-12-P1299_442725:12-nf] ","title":"Homily XIV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"There is also another passage in Zechariah which plainly declares that the Almighty sent the Almighty; and of what persons can this be understood but of God the Father and God the Son?

You describe the one as choosing the latter and plunging without hesitation into the deep, while the other, refusing both, shews quite as much abhorrence of the worship of idols as his companion, but declines to commit himself to the waves, and waits for this fate to be violently forced upon him. You have suggested these circumstances, and you ask which of these two took the better course. I think that you will agree with me that the latter was the more praiseworthy. No one ought to withdraw himself from life unbidden, but should await either a natural or a violent death. Our Lord gave us this lesson when He bade those that are persecuted in one city flee to another and again commanded them to quit even this and depart to another.[fn-53-P5347_1287315:5-nf] In obedience to this teaching the divine Apostle escaped the violence of the governor of the city, and had no hesitation in speaking of the manner of his flight, but spoke of the basket, the wall, and the window, and boasted and glorified in the act.[fn-53-P5348_1287583:6-nf] For what looks discreditable is made honourable by the divine command. In the same manner the Apostle called himself at one time a Pharisee[fn-53-P5349_1288112:7-nf] and at another a Roman,[fn-53-P5350_1288154:8-nf] not because he was afraid of death, but acting quite fairly in fight.[fn-53-P5351_1288242:9-nf] In the same way when he had learnt the Jews' plot against him he appealed to Caesar[fn-53-P5352_1288391:10-nf] and sent his sister's son to the chief captain to report the designs hatched against him, not because he clung to this present life, but in obedience to the divine law. For assuredly our Lord does not wish us to throw ourselves into obvious peril; and this is taught us by deed as well as by word, for more than once He avoided the murderous violence of the Jews. And the great Peter, first of the Apostles, when he was loosed from his chains and had escaped from the hands of Herod, came to the house of John, who was surnamed Mark, and after removing the anxiety of his friends by his visit and bidding them maintain silence, betook himself to another house in the endeavour to conceal himself more effectually by the removal.[fn-53-P5353_1289139:11-nf] And we shall find just the same kind of wisdom in the old Testament, for the famous Moses, after playing the man in his struggle with the Egyptian and finding out the next day that the homicide had become known, ran away, travelled a long journey, and arrived at the land of Midian.[fn-53-P5354_1289446:12-nf] In like manner the great Elias when he had learnt Jezebel's threats did not give himself up to them which wished to kill him, but left the world and hurried to the desert.[fn-53-P5355_1289641:13-nf] And if it is right and agreeable to God to escape the violence of our enemies, surely it is much more right to refuse to obey them when they order a man to become his own murderer. Our Lord did not give in to the devil when he bade Him throw Himself down,[fn-53-P5356_1289923:14-nf] and when he had armed against Him the hands of the Jews by means of the scourge and the thorns and the nails, and the creature was urging Him to bring wholesale destruction on His wicked foes, the Lord Himself forbade, because He knew that His Passion was bringing salvation to the world, and it was for this reason that just before His Passion He said to His Apostles \"Pray that ye enter not into temptation,\"[fn-53-P5357_1290352:15-nf] and taught us to pray \"Lead us not into temptation.\"[fn-53-P5358_1290426:16-nf] Now let us shift our ground a little, and we shall see our way more clearly. Let us eliminate the sea from the argument, and suppose the judge to have given each of the martyrs a sword, and ordered the one who refused to sacrifice to cut off his own head; who in his senses would have endured to redden his hand with his own blood, become his own headsman, lift his hand against himself, in obedience to the judge's order?","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":4,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius[fn-54-P5407_1670604:155-nf] (for such is Marcion's proposition) he \"came down to the Galilean city of Capernaum,\" of course meaning from the heaven of the Creator, to which he had previously descended from his own. What then had been his Course,[fn-54-P5408_1670853:156-nf] for him to be described as first descending from his own heaven to the Creator's? For why should I abstain from censuring those parts of the statement which do not satisfy the requirement of an ordinary narrative, but always end in a falsehood? To be sure, our censure has been once for all expressed in the question, which we have already[fn-54-P5409_1671208:157-nf] suggested: Whether, when descending through the Creator's domain, and indeed in hostility to him, he could possibly have been admitted by him, and by him been transmitted to the earth, which was equally his territory? Now, however, I want also to know the remainder of his course down, assuming that he came down. For we must not be too nice in inquiring[fn-54-P5410_1671639:158-nf] whether it is supposed that he was seen in any place. To come into view[fn-54-P5411_1671788:159-nf] indicates[fn-54-P5412_1671815:160-nf] a sudden unexpected glance, which for a moment fixed[fn-54-P5413_1671882:161-nf] the eye upon the object that passed before the view, without staying. But when it happens that a descent has been effected, it is apparent, and comes under the notice of the eyes.[fn-54-P5414_1672080:162-nf] Moreover, it takes account of fact, and thus obliges one to examine in what condition with what preparation,[fn-54-P5415_1672571:163-nf] with how much violence or moderation, and further, at what time of the day or night, the descent was made; who, again, saw the descent, who reported it, who seriously avouched the fact, which certainly was not easy to be believed, even after the asseveration. It is, in short, too bad[fn-54-P5416_1672873:164-nf] that Romulus should have had in Proculus an avoucher of his ascent to heaven, when the Christ of (this) god could not find any one to announce his descent from heaven; just as if the ascent of the one and the descent of the other were not effected on one and the same ladder of falsehood! Then, what had he to do with Galilee, if he did not belong to the Creator by whom[fn-54-P5417_1673261:165-nf] that region was destined (for His Christ) when about to enter on His ministry?[fn-54-P5418_1673352:166-nf] As Isaiah says: \"Drink in this first, and be prompt, O region of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, and ye others who (inhabit) the sea-coast, and that of Jordan, Galilee of the nations, ye people who sit in darkness, behold a great light; upon you, who inhabit (that) land, sitting in the shadow of death, the light hath arisen.\"[fn-54-P5419_1673715:167-nf] It is, however, well that Marcion's god does claim to be the enlightener of the nations, that so he might have the better reason for coming down from heaven; only, if it must needs be,[fn-54-P5420_1674551:168-nf] he should rather have made Pontus his place of descent than Galilee. But since both the place and the work of illumination according to the prophecy are compatible with Christ, we begin to discern[fn-54-P5421_1674766:169-nf] that He is the subject of the prophecy, which shows that at the very outset of His ministry, He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them;[fn-54-P5422_1674953:170-nf] for Marcion has erased the passage as an interpolation.[fn-54-P5423_1675029:171-nf] It will, however, be vain for him to deny that Christ uttered in word what He forthwith did partially indeed. For the prophecy about place He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the synagogue. As the adage runs: \"The business on which we are come, do at once.\" Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; \"[fn-54-P5424_1675421:172-nf] and, \"It is not meet to take the children'sbread, and to cast it to dogs,\"[fn-54-P5425_1675517:173-nf] -in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely (this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to Israelites first that He offers the \"bread\" of His doctrine; surely it is because they are \"children\" that He shows them this priority.[fn-54-P5426_1675958:174-nf] Observe, He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as \"dogs.\" For to whom else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the synagogue-one so abruptly appearing,[fn-54-P5427_1676287:175-nf] so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus-that most faithful witness of the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that He must not be admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right of entering[fn-54-P5428_1676727:176-nf] the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But \"they were all astonished at His doctrine.\" Of course they were; \"for, says (St. Luke), \"His word was with power[fn-54-P5429_1677113:177-nf] -not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets. No doubt, His divine discourse[fn-54-P5430_1677231:178-nf] gave forth both power and grace, building up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. Otherwise, instead of \"astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also, without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity, Inasmuch, then, as the Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally[fn-54-P5431_1677982:179-nf] shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged as belonging to Him,[fn-54-P5432_1678239:180-nf] in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged a deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In the same passage, \"the spirit of an unclean devil\" exclaims: \"What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God.\"[fn-54-P5433_1678598:181-nf] I do not here raise the question whether this appellation was suitable to one who ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by the Creator.[fn-54-P5434_1678771:182-nf] Elsewhere[fn-54-P5435_1678806:183-nf] there has been already given a full consideration of His titles.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius[fn-54-P5407_1670604:155-nf] (for such is Marcion's proposition) he \"came down to the Galilean city of Capernaum,\" of course meaning from the heaven of the Creator, to which he had previously descended from his own.

To be sure, our censure has been once for all expressed in the question, which we have already[fn-54-P5409_1671208:157-nf] suggested: Whether, when descending through the Creator's domain, and indeed in hostility to him, he could possibly have been admitted by him, and by him been transmitted to the earth, which was equally his territory? Now, however, I want also to know the remainder of his course down, assuming that he came down. For we must not be too nice in inquiring[fn-54-P5410_1671639:158-nf] whether it is supposed that he was seen in any place. To come into view[fn-54-P5411_1671788:159-nf] indicates[fn-54-P5412_1671815:160-nf] a sudden unexpected glance, which for a moment fixed[fn-54-P5413_1671882:161-nf] the eye upon the object that passed before the view, without staying. But when it happens that a descent has been effected, it is apparent, and comes under the notice of the eyes.[fn-54-P5414_1672080:162-nf] Moreover, it takes account of fact, and thus obliges one to examine in what condition with what preparation,[fn-54-P5415_1672571:163-nf] with how much violence or moderation, and further, at what time of the day or night, the descent was made; who, again, saw the descent, who reported it, who seriously avouched the fact, which certainly was not easy to be believed, even after the asseveration. It is, in short, too bad[fn-54-P5416_1672873:164-nf] that Romulus should have had in Proculus an avoucher of his ascent to heaven, when the Christ of (this) god could not find any one to announce his descent from heaven; just as if the ascent of the one and the descent of the other were not effected on one and the same ladder of falsehood! Then, what had he to do with Galilee, if he did not belong to the Creator by whom[fn-54-P5417_1673261:165-nf] that region was destined (for His Christ) when about to enter on His ministry?[fn-54-P5418_1673352:166-nf] As Isaiah says: \"Drink in this first, and be prompt, O region of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, and ye others who (inhabit) the sea-coast, and that of Jordan, Galilee of the nations, ye people who sit in darkness, behold a great light; upon you, who inhabit (that) land, sitting in the shadow of death, the light hath arisen.\"[fn-54-P5419_1673715:167-nf] It is, however, well that Marcion's god does claim to be the enlightener of the nations, that so he might have the better reason for coming down from heaven; only, if it must needs be,[fn-54-P5420_1674551:168-nf] he should rather have made Pontus his place of descent than Galilee. But since both the place and the work of illumination according to the prophecy are compatible with Christ, we begin to discern[fn-54-P5421_1674766:169-nf] that He is the subject of the prophecy, which shows that at the very outset of His ministry, He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them;[fn-54-P5422_1674953:170-nf] for Marcion has erased the passage as an interpolation.[fn-54-P5423_1675029:171-nf] It will, however, be vain for him to deny that Christ uttered in word what He forthwith did partially indeed. For the prophecy about place He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the synagogue. As the adage runs: \"The business on which we are come, do at once.\" Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; \"[fn-54-P5424_1675421:172-nf] and, \"It is not meet to take the children'sbread, and to cast it to dogs,\"[fn-54-P5425_1675517:173-nf] -in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely (this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to Israelites first that He offers the \"bread\" of His doctrine; surely it is because they are \"children\" that He shows them this priority.[fn-54-P5426_1675958:174-nf] Observe, He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as \"dogs.\" For to whom else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the synagogue-one so abruptly appearing,[fn-54-P5427_1676287:175-nf] so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus-that most faithful witness of the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that He must not be admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right of entering[fn-54-P5428_1676727:176-nf] the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But \"they were all astonished at His doctrine.\" Of course they were; \"for, says (St. Luke), \"His word was with power[fn-54-P5429_1677113:177-nf] -not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets. No doubt, His divine discourse[fn-54-P5430_1677231:178-nf] gave forth both power and grace, building up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. Otherwise, instead of \"astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also, without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity, Inasmuch, then, as the Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally[fn-54-P5431_1677982:179-nf] shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged as belonging to Him,[fn-54-P5432_1678239:180-nf] in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged a deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In the same passage, \"the spirit of an unclean devil\" exclaims: \"What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God.\"[fn-54-P5433_1678598:181-nf] I do not here raise the question whether this appellation was suitable to one who ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by the Creator.[fn-54-P5434_1678771:182-nf] Elsewhere[fn-54-P5435_1678806:183-nf] there has been already given a full consideration of His titles.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_26_homily_xx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And neither here hath He put the whole, but even in this place it is gently spoken; although He had in the wilderness shown forth to a surpassing extent His conflicts in that behalf.[fn-21-P2131_709245:8-nf] However He doth not express this, nor bring it forward; for it was not yet time to reveal it; but for a while He searches out for reasons, maintaining the place of an adviser rather than a lawgiver, in His sayings on this subject.","title":"Homily XX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"9. That this number, then, is a sign of that laborious period in which, under the discipline of Christ the King, we have to fight against the devil, is also indicated by the fact that both the law and the prophets solemnized a fast of forty days,-that is to say, a humbling of the soul,-in the person of Moses and Elias, who fasted each for a space of forty days.[fn-13-P1390_556730:31-nf] And what else does the Gospel narrative shadow forth under the fast of the Lord Himself, during which forty days He was also tempted of the devil,[fn-13-P1391_556915:32-nf] than that condition of temptation which appertains to us through all the space of this age, and which He bore in the flesh which He condescended to take to Himself from our mortality? After the resurrection also, it was His will to remain with His disciples on the earth not longer than forty days,[fn-13-P1392_557235:33-nf] continuing to mingle for that space of time with this life of theirs in the way of human intercourse, and partaking along with them of the food needful for mortal men, although He Himself was to die no more; and all this was done with the view of signifying to them through these forty days, that although His presence should be hidden from their eyes, He would yet fulfil what He promised when He said, \"Lo, I am with you, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-13-P1393_557706:34-nf] And in explanation of the circumstance that this particular number should denote this temporal and earthly life, what suggests itself most immediately in the meantime, although there may be another and subtler method of accounting for it, is the consideration that the seasons of the years also revolve in four successive alternations, and that the world itself has its bounds determined by four divisions, which Scripture sometimes designates by the names of the winds,-East and West, Aquilo [or North] and Meridian [or South].[fn-13-P1394_558258:35-nf] But the number forty is equivalent to four times ten.

Matthew proceeds with his narrative in these terms: \"Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered. And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. And so the account continues, until we come to the words, Then the devil left[fn-15-P1565_640621:156-nf] him: and, behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.\"[fn-15-P1566_640694:157-nf] This whole narrative is given also in a similar manner by Luke, although not in the same order. And this makes it uncertain which of the two latter temptations took place first: whether it was that the kingdoms of the world were shown Him first, and then that He Himself was taken up to the pinnacle of the temple thereafter; or whether it was that this latter act occurred first, and that the other scene followed it. It is, however, a matter of no real consequence, provided it be clear that all these incidents did take place. And as Luke sets forth the same events and ideas in different words, attention need not ever be called to the fact that no loss results thereby to truth. Mark, again, does indeed attest the fact that He was tempted of the devil in the wilderness for forty days and forty nights; but he gives no statement of what was said to Him, or of the replies He made. At the same time, he does not fail to notice the circumstance which is omitted by Luke, namely, that the angels ministered unto Him.[fn-15-P1567_641737:158-nf] John, however, has left out this whole passage.

Matthew's narrative is continued thus: \"Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, He departed into Galilee.\"[fn-15-P1571_642018:159-nf] Mark states the same fact, as also does Luke,[fn-15-P1572_642085:160-nf] only Luke says nothing in the present section as to John being cast into prison. The evangelist John, again, tells us that, before Jesus went into Galilee, Peter and Andrew were with Him one day, and that on that occasion the former had this name, Peter, given him, while before that period he was called Simon. Likewise John tells us, that on the day following, when Jesus was now desirous of going forth unto Galilee, He found Philip, and said to him that he shouldfollow Him. Thus, too, the evangelist comes to give the narrative about Nathanael.[fn-15-P1573_642667:161-nf] Further, he informs us that on the third day, when He was yet in Galilee, Jesus wrought the miracle of the turning of the water into wine at Cana.[fn-15-P1574_642838:162-nf] All these incidents are left unrecorded by the other evangelists, who continue their narratives at once with the statement of the return of Jesus into Galilee. Hence we are to understand that there was an interval here of several days, during which those incidents took place in the history of the disciples which are inserted at this point by John.[fn-15-P1575_643210:163-nf] Neither is there anything contradictory here to that other passage where Matthew tells us how the Lord said to Peter, \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church.\"[fn-15-P1576_643614:164-nf] But we are not to understand that that was the time when he first received this name; but we are rather to suppose that this took place on the occasion when it was said to him, as John mentions, \"Thou shall be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, A stone.\"[fn-15-P1577_643900:165-nf] Thus the Lord could address him at that later period by this very name, when He said, \"Thou art Peter.\" For He does not say then, \"Thou shalt be called Peter,\" but, \"Thou art Peter;\" because on a previous occasion he had already been spoken to in this manner, \"Thou shalt be called.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"35.

Furthermore, we must consider the question how the evangelist John, before there is any mention of the casting of John the Baptist into prison, tells us that Jesus went into Galilee. For, after relating how He turned the water into wine at Cana of Galilee, and how He came down to Capernaum with His mother and His disciples, and how they abode there not many days, he tells us that He went up then to Jerusalem on account of the passover; that after this He came into the land of Judaea along with His disciples, and tarried there with them, and baptized; and then in what follows at this point the evangelist says: \"And John also was baptizing in Aenon, near to Salim, because there was much water there; and they came, and were baptized: for John was not yet cast into prison.\"[fn-16-P1606_657245:184-nf] On the other hand, Matthew says: \"Now when He had heard that John was cast into prison, Jesus departed into Galilee.\"[fn-16-P1607_657395:185-nf] In like manner, Mark's words are: \"Now, after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee.\"[fn-16-P1608_657517:186-nf] Luke, again, says nothing indeed about the imprisonment of John; but notwithstanding this, after his account of the baptism and temptation of Christ, he also makes a statement to the same effect with that of these other two, namely, that Jesus went into Galilee. For he has connected the several parts of his narrative here in this way: \"And when all the temptation was ended, the devil departed from Him for a season; and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of Him through all the region round about,\"[fn-16-P1609_658085:187-nf] From all this, however, we may gather, not that these three evangelists have made any statement opposed to the evangelist John, but only that they have left unrecorded the Lord's first advent in Galilee after His baptism; on which occasion also He turned the water into wine there. For at that period John had not yet been cast into prison. And we are also to understand that these three evangelists have introduced into the context of these narratives an account of another journey of His into Galilee, which took place after John's imprisonment, regarding which return into Galilee the evangelist John himself furnishes the following notice: \"When, therefore, Jesus knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself baptized not, but His disciples), he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.\"[fn-16-P1610_658972:188-nf] So, then, we perceive that by that time John hadbeen already cast into prison; and further, thatthe Jews had heard that He was making and baptizing more disciples than John had made and baptized.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"150","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"45. This we might very well suppose to have been the case, as I have said, were it not that a difficulty is felt to attach to the circumstance that Matthew tells us how this discourse was delivered on a mount by the Lord in a sitting posture; while Luke says that it was spoken on a plain by the Lord in a standing posture. This difference, accordingly, makes it seem as if the former referred to one discourse, and the latter to another. And what should there be, indeed, to hinder [us from supposing] Christ to have repeated elsewhere some words which He had already spoken, or from doing a second time certain things which He had already done on some previous occasion? However, that these two discourses, of which the one is inserted by Matthew and the other by Luke, are not separated by a long space of time, is with much probability inferred from the fact that, at once in what precedes and in what follows them, both the evangelists have related certain incidents either similar or perfectly identical, so that it is not unreasonably felt that the narrations of the writers who introduce these things are occupied with the same localities and days. For Matthew's recital proceeds in the following terms: \"And there followed Him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain; and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven ;\"[fn-16-P1622_664660:195-nf] and so forth. Here it may appear that His desire was to free Himself from the great crowds of people, and that for this reason He went up into the mountain, as if He meant to withdraw Himself from the multitudes, and seek an opportunity of speaking with His disciples alone. And this seems to be certified also by Luke, whose account is to the following effect: \"And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, He called unto Him His disciples: and of them He chose twelve, whom also He named apostles; Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon, who is called Zelotes, Judas the brother of James, and Judas Scarioth, which was the traitor. And He came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of His disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea-coast of Tyre[fn-16-P1623_665711:196-nf] and Sidon, which had come to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases; and they that were vexed with unclean spirits were healed.[fn-16-P1624_665957:197-nf] And the whole multitude sought to touch Him; for there went virtue out of Him, and healed them all. And He lifted up His eyes on His disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of heaven;\"[fn-16-P1625_666224:198-nf] and so on. Here the relation permits us to understand that, after selecting on the mountain twelve disciples out of the larger body, whom He also named apostles (which incident Matthew has omitted), He then delivered that discourse which Matthew has introduced, and which Luke has left unnoticed,-that is to say, the one on the mount; and that thereafter, when He had now come down, He spoke in the plain a second discourse similar to the first, on which Matthew is silent, but which is detailed by Luke; and further, that both these sermons were concluded in the same manner.[fn-16-P1626_666824:199-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"222","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"92.

But because (the apostle) subjoins, on the subject of our glory, that \"none of the princes of this world knew it for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,\"[fn-74-P7409_2134549:248-nf] the heretic argues that the princes of this world crucified the Lord (that is, the Christ of the rival god) in order that this blow might even recoil[fn-74-P7410_2134720:249-nf] on the Creator Himself. Any one, however, who has seen from what we have already said how our glory must be regarded as issuing from the Creator, will already have come to the conclusion that, inasmuch as the Creator settled it in His own secret purpose, it properly enough was unknown to all the princes[fn-74-P7411_2135051:250-nf] and powers of the Creator, on the principle that servants are not permitted to know their masters' plans, much less the fallen angels and the leader of transgression himself, the devil; for I should contend that these, on account of their fall, were greater strangers still to any knowledge of the Creator's dispensations. But it is no longer open to me[fn-74-P7412_2135424:251-nf] even to interpret the princes and powers of this world as the Creator's, since the apostle imputes ignorance to them, whereas even the devil according to our Gospel recognised Jesus in the temptation,[fn-74-P7413_2135659:252-nf] and, according to the record which is common to both (Marcionites and ourselves) the evil spirit knew that Jesus was the Holy One of God, and that Jesus was His name, and that He was come to destroy them.[fn-74-P7414_2135887:253-nf] The parable also of the strong man armed, whom a stronger than he overcame and seized his goods, is admitted by Marcion to have reference to the Creator:[fn-74-P7415_2136061:254-nf] therefore the Creator could not have been ignorant any longer of the God of glory, since He is overcome by him;[fn-74-P7416_2136219:255-nf] nor could He have crucified him whom He was unable to cope with. The inevitable inference, therefore, as it seems to me, is that we must believe that the princes and powers of the Creator did knowingly crucify the God of glory in His Christ, with that desperation and excessive malice with which the most abandoned slaves do not even hesitate to slay their masters. For it is written in my Gospel[fn-74-P7417_2136672:256-nf] that \"Satan entered into Judas.\"[fn-74-P7418_2136721:257-nf] According to Marcion, however, the apostle in the passage under consideration[fn-74-P7419_2136820:258-nf] does not allow the imputation of ignorance, with respect to the Lord of glory, to the powers of the Creator; because, indeed, he will have it that these are not meant by \"the princes of this world.\" But (the apostle) evidently[fn-74-P7420_2137068:259-nf] did not speak of spiritual princes; so that he meant secular ones, those of the princely people, (chief in the divine dispensation, although) not, of course, amongst the nations of the world, and their rulers, and king Herod, and even Pilate, and, as represented by him,[fn-74-P7421_2137355:260-nf] that power of Rome which was the greatest in the world, and then presided over by him. Thus the arguments of the other side are pulled down, and our own proofs are thereby built up. But you still maintain that our glory comes from your god, with whom it also lay in secret. Then why does your god employ the self-same Scripture[fn-74-P7422_2137698:261-nf] which the apostle also relies on? What has your god to do at all with the sayings of the prophets? \"Who hath discovered the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-74-P7423_2137895:262-nf] So says Isaiah. What has he also to do with illustrations from our God? For when (the apostle) calls himself \"a wise master-builder,\"[fn-74-P7424_2138049:263-nf] we find that the Creator by Isaiah designates the teacher who sketches[fn-74-P7425_2138143:264-nf] out the divine discipline by the same title, \"I will take away from Judah the cunning artificer,\"[fn-74-P7426_2138262:265-nf] etc. And was it not Paul himself who was there foretold, destined \"to be taken away from Judah\"-that is, from Judaism-for the erection of Christianity, in order \"to lay that only foundation, which is Christ? \"[fn-74-P7427_2138584:266-nf] Of this work the Creator also by the same prophet says, \"Behold, I lay in Sion for a foundation a precious stone and honourable; and he that resteth thereon shall not be confounded.\"[fn-74-P7428_2138790:267-nf] Unless it be, that God professed Himself to be the builder up of an earthly work, that so He might not give any sign of His Christ, as destined to be the foundation of such as believe in Him, upon which every man should build at will the superstructure of either sound or worthless doctrine; forasmuch as it is the Creator's function, when a man's work shall be tried by fire, (or) when a reward shall be recompensed to him by fire; because it is by fire that the test is applied to the building which you erect upon the foundation which is laid by Him, that is, the foundation of His Christ.[fn-74-P7429_2139407:268-nf] \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \"[fn-74-P7430_2140182:269-nf] Now, since man is the property, and the work, and the image and likeness of the Creator, having his flesh, formed by Him of the ground, and his soul of His afflatus, it follows that Marcion's god wholly dwells in a temple which belongs to another, if so be we are not the Creator's temple. But \"if any man defile the temple of God, he shall be himself destroyed\"[fn-74-P7431_2140568:270-nf] -of course, by the God of the temple.[fn-74-P7432_2140658:271-nf] If you threaten an avenger, you threaten us with the Creator. \"Ye must become fools, that ye may be wise.\"[fn-74-P7433_2140788:272-nf] Wherefore? \"Because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.\"[fn-74-P7434_2140882:273-nf] With what God? Even if the ancient Scriptures have contributed nothing in support of our view thus far,[fn-74-P7435_2141009:274-nf] an excellent testimony turns up in what (the apostle) here adjoins: \"For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\"[fn-74-P7436_2141337:275-nf] For in general we may conclude for certain that he could not possibly have cited the authority of that God whom he was bound to destroy, since he would not teach for Him.[fn-74-P7437_2141560:276-nf] \"Therefore,\" says he, \"let no man glory in man; \"[fn-74-P7438_2141638:277-nf] an injunction which is in accordance with the teaching of the Creator, \"wretched is the man that trusteth in man; \"[fn-74-P7439_2141777:278-nf] again, \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in man; \"[fn-74-P7440_2141866:279-nf] and the same thing is said about glorying (in princes).[fn-74-P7441_2141944:280-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If, owing to the fault of human error, the word God has become a common name (since in the world there are said and believed to be \"gods many\"[fn-76-P7665_2195216:488-nf] ), yet \"the blessed God,\" (who is \"the Father) of our Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-76-P7666_2195313:489-nf] will be understood to be no other God than the Creator, who both blessed all things (that He had made), as you find in Genesis,[fn-76-P7667_2195461:490-nf] and is Himself \"blessed by all things,\" as Daniel tells us.[fn-76-P7668_2195540:491-nf] Now, if the title of Father may be claimed for (Marcion's) sterile god, how much more for the Creator? To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also \"the Father of mercies,\"[fn-76-P7669_2195768:492-nf] and (in the prophets) has been described as \"full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.\"[fn-76-P7670_2195892:493-nf] In Jonah you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.[fn-76-P7671_2196035:494-nf] How inflexible was He at the tears of Hezekiah![fn-76-P7672_2196104:495-nf] How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.[fn-76-P7673_2196231:496-nf] How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin[fn-76-P7674_2196318:497-nf] -preferring, indeed, the sinner's repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.[fn-76-P7675_2196454:498-nf] Now, if Marcion's god has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be \"the Father of mercies.\" Since, however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we on our side, too,[fn-76-P7676_2196811:499-nf] adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"25.

For if the earth has to suffer either joy or injury, it is simply on man's account, that he may suffer the joy or the sorrow through the events which happen to his dwelling-place, whereby he will rather have to pay the penalty which, simply on his account, even the earth must suffer. When, therefore, God even threatens the earth, I would prefer saying that He threatens the flesh: so likewise, when He makes a promise to the earth, I would rather understand Him as promising the flesh; as in that passage of David: \"The Lord is King, let the earth be glad,\"[fn-99-P9938_2746965:181-nf] -meaning the flesh of the saints, to which appertains the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. Then he afterwards says: \"The earth saw and trembled; the mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord,\"-meaning, no doubt the flesh of the wicked; and (in a similar sense) it is written: \"For they shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-99-P9939_2747322:182-nf] If indeed it will be thought that both these passages were pronounced simply of the element earth, how can it be consistent that it should shake and melt at the presence of the Lord, at whose royal dignity it before exulted? So again in Isaiah, \"Ye shall eat the good of the land,\"[fn-99-P9940_2747626:183-nf] the expression means the blessings which await the flesh when in the kingdom of God it shall be renewed, and made like the angels, and waiting to obtain the things \"which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, and which have not entered into the heart of man.\"[fn-99-P9941_2747905:184-nf] Otherwise, how vain that God should invite men to obedience by the fruits of the field and the elements of this life, when He dispenses these to even irreligious men and blasphemers; on a general condition once for all made to man, \"sending rain on the good and on the evil, and making His sun to shine on the just and on the unjust!\"[fn-99-P9942_2748261:185-nf] Happy, no doubt, is faith, if it is to obtain gifts which the enemies of God and Christ not only use, but even abuse, \"worshipping the creature itself in opposition to the Creator!\"[fn-99-P9943_2748463:186-nf] You will reckon, (I suppose) onions and truffles among earth's bounties, since the Lord declares that \"man shall not live on bread alone!\"[fn-99-P9944_2748621:187-nf] In this way the Jews lose heavenly blessings, by confining their hopes to earthly ones, being ignorant of the promise of heavenly bread, and of the oil of God's unction, and the wine of the Spirit, and of that water of life which has its vigour from the vine of Christ. On exactly the same principle, they consider the special soil of Judµa to be that very holy land, which ought rather to be interpreted of the Lord's flesh, which, in all those who put on Christ, is thenceforward the holy land; holy indeed by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, truly flowing with milk and honey by the sweetness of His assurance, truly Judµan by reason of the friendship of God. For \"he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, but he who is one inwardly.\"[fn-99-P9945_2749379:188-nf] In the same way it is that both God's temple and Jerusalem (must be understood) when it is said by Isaiah: \"Awake, awake, O Jerusalem! put on the strength of thine arm; awake, as in thine earliest time,\"[fn-99-P9946_2749607:189-nf] that is to say, in that innocence which preceded the fall into sin. For how can words of this kind of exhortation andinvitation be suitable for that Jerusalem which killed the prophets, and stoned those that were sent to them, and at last crucified its very Lord? Neither indeed is salvation promised to any one land at all, which must needs pass away with the fashion of the whole world. Even if anybody should venture strongly to contend that paradise is the holy land, which it may be possible to designate as the land of our first parents Adam and Eve, it will even then follow that the restoration of paradise will seem to be promised to the flesh, whose lot it was to inhabit and keep it, in order that man may be recalled thereto just such as he was driven from it.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":63,"source_paragraph":"190","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now you have received your mouth, O man, for the purpose of devouring your food and imbibing your drink: why not, however, for the higher purpose of uttering speech, so as to distinguish yourself from all other animals?

And a little after he adds, As from the outset of His taking the likeness of man He underwent in appearance all the experiences of humanity, it was quite consistent that He should seal the dispensation by appearing to die. How can this infamous liar, who declares that Christ feigned death, expect to be believed? Did Christ utter falsehood when He said, \"It behoves the Son of man to be killed, and to rise the third day?\"[fn-23-P2384_1450259:5-nf] And do you tell us to believe what you say, as if you utter no falsehoods?

In the case of a man, anger, sorrow, sleeping, being hungry and thirst, are often involuntary; in Christ they were acts of His own will. So also men are born without any act of their own will, and suffer against their will; while Christ was born and suffered by His own will.

Sometimes his aim has been to destroy the truth by defending it. He maintains that there is one only Lord, the Almighty Creator of the world, in order that out of this doctrine of the unity he may fabricate a heresy. He says that the Father Himself came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself Jesus Christ. Here the old serpent has fallen out with himself, since, when he tempted Christ after John's baptism, he approached Him as \"the Son of God; \"surely intimating that God had a Son, even on the testimony of the very Scriptures, out of which he was at the moment forging his temptation: \"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-103-P10383_2908627:3-nf] Again: \"If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;[fn-103-P10384_2908708:4-nf] for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning thee\"-referring no doubt, to the Father-\"and in their hands they shall bear thee up, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.\"[fn-103-P10385_2908912:5-nf] Or perhaps, after all, he was only reproaching the Gospels with a lie, saying in fact: \"Away with Matthew; away with Luke!

For he was the first to import into Rome from Asia this kind of heretical pravity, a man in other respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the pride of confessorship simply and solely because he had to bear for a short time the annoyance of a prison; on which occasion, even \"if he had given his body to be burned, it would have profiled him nothing,\" not having the love of God,[fn-103-P10387_2909935:7-nf] whose very gifts he has resisted and destroyed. For after the Bishop of Rome[fn-103-P10388_2910031:8-nf] had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace[fn-103-P10389_2910208:9-nf] on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, he, by importunately urging false accusations against the prophets themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority of the bishop's predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the pacific letter which he had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the said gifts. By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father. Praxeas' tares had been moreover sown, and had produced their fruit here also,[fn-103-P10390_2910837:10-nf] while many were asleep in their simplicity of doctrine; but these tares actually seemed to have been plucked up, having been discovered and exposed by him whose agency God was pleased to employ. Indeed, Praxeas had deliberately resumed his old (true) faith, teaching it after his renunciation of error; and there is his own handwriting in evidence remaining among the carnally-minded,[fn-103-P10391_2911565:11-nf] in whose society the transaction then took place; afterwards nothing was heard of him. We indeed, on our part, subsequently withdrew from the carnally-minded on our acknowledgment and maintenance of the Paraclete.[fn-103-P10392_2911857:12-nf] But the tares of Praxeas had then everywhere shaken out their seed, which having lain hid for some while, with its vitality concealed under a mask, has now broken out with fresh life. But again shall it be rooted up, if the Lord will, even now; but if not now, in the day when all bundles of tares shall be gathered together, and along with every other stumbling-block shall be burnt up with unquenchable fire.[fn-103-P10393_2912610:13-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In addition to Philip's conversation, and the Lord's reply to it, the reader will observe that we have run through John's Gospel to show that many other passages of a clear purport, both before and after that chapter, are only in strict accord with that single and prominent statement, which must be interpreted agreeably to all other places, rather than in opposition to them, and indeed to its own inherent and natural sense. I will not here largely use the support of the other Gospels, which confirm our belief by the Lord's nativity: it is sufficient to remark that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by the angel himself as the Son of God: \"The Spirit of God shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10814_3033851:359-nf] On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth will prevail. Of course, they say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate[fn-108-P10815_3034077:360-nf] what, if it had been true, would have been written. Whom was he[fn-108-P10816_3034156:361-nf] so afraid of as not plainly to declare, \"God shall come upon thee, and the Highest shall overshadow thee? \"Now, by saying \"the Spirit of God\" (although the Spirit of God is God, ) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion[fn-108-P10817_3034435:362-nf] of the whole Godhead to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of \"the Son.\" The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same as the Word. For just as, when John says, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-108-P10818_3034811:363-nf] we understand the Spirit also in the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit, and the Two are One (and the same).[fn-108-P10819_3035093:364-nf] Now John must mean One when he speaks of Him as \"having been made flesh,\" and the angel Another when he announces Him as \"about to be born,\" if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of God is not actually He whose Word He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not actually He whose Spirit He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a personal subject,[fn-108-P10820_3035989:365-nf] and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of God, although He is an actually existing thing,[fn-108-P10821_3036396:366-nf] yet He cannot be God Himself[fn-108-P10822_3036449:367-nf] (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will \"the power of the Highest\" not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing thing, as being Spirit-in the same way as the wisdom (of God) and the providence (of God) is not God: these attributes are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance.

For on that night when some of your nation, who had been sent by the Pharisees and Scribes, and teachers,[fn-49-P4933_1091378:394-nf] came upon Him from the Mount[fn-49-P4934_1091510:395-nf] of Olives, those whom Scripture called butting and prematurely destructive calves surrounded Him. And the expression, `Fat bulls have beset me round, 'He spoke beforehand of those who acted similarly to the calves, when He was led before your teachers. And the Scripture described them as bulls, since we know that bulls are authors of calves' existence. As therefore the bulls are the begetters of the calves, so your teachers were the cause why their children went out to the Mount of Olives to take Him and bring Him to them. And the expression, `For there is none to help, 'is also indicative of what took place. For there was not even a single man to assist Him as an innocent person. And the expression, `They opened their mouth upon me like a roaring lion, ' designates him who was then king of the Jews, and was called Herod, a successor of the Herod who, when Christ was born, slew all the infants in Bethlehem born about the same time, because he imagined that amongst them He would assuredly be of whom the Magi from Arabia had spoken; for he was ignorant of the will of Him that is stronger than all, how He had commanded Joseph and Mary to take the Child and depart into Egypt, and there to remain until a revelation should again be made to them to return into their own country. And there they did remain until Herod, who slew the infants in Bethlehem, was dead, and Archelaus had succeeded him. And he died before Christ came to the dispensation on the cross which was given Him by His Father. And when Herod succeeded Archelaus, having received the authority which had been allotted to him, Pilate sent to him by way of compliment Jesus bound; and God foreknowing that this would happen, had thus spoken: `And they brought Him to the Assyrian, a present to the king.'[fn-49-P4935_1093489:396-nf] Or He meant the devil by the lion roaring against Him: whom Moses calls the serpent, but in Job and Zechariah he is called the devil, and by Jesus is addressed as Satan, showing that a compounded name was acquired by him from the deeds which he performed. For <sq>sata in the Jewish and Syrian tongue means apostate; and <sq>nas is the word from which he is called by interpretation the serpent, i.e., according to the interpretation of the Hebrew term, from both of which there arises the single word Satanas. For this devil, when [Jesus] went up from the river Jordan, at the time when the voice spake to Him, `Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten Thee, '[fn-49-P4936_1094170:397-nf] is recorded in the memoirs of the apostles to have come to Him and tempted Him, even so far as to say to Him, `Worship me; 'and Christ answered him, `Get thee behind me, Satan: thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.'[fn-49-P4937_1094449:398-nf] For as he had deceived Adam, so he hoped[fn-49-P4938_1094514:399-nf] that he might contrive some mischief against Christ also. Moreover, the statement, `All my bones are poured out[fn-49-P4939_1094652:400-nf] and dispersed like water; my heart has become like wax, melting in the midst of my belly, 'was a prediction of that which happened to Him on that night when men came out against Him to the Mount of Olives to seize Him.

Accordingly the name Israel signifies this, A man who overcomes power; for <i>isra is a man overcoming, and <i>el is power.[fn-51-P5103_1154456:490-nf] And that Christ would act so when He became man was foretold by the mystery of Jacob's wrestling with Him who appeared to him, in that He ministered to the will of the Father, yet nevertheless is God, in that He is the first-begotten of all creatures. For when He became man, as I previously remarked, the devil came to Him-i.e., that power which is called the serpent and Sa-tan-tempting Him, and striving to effect His downfall by asking Him to worship him. But He destroyed and overthrew the devil, having proved him to be wicked, in that he asked to be worshipper as God, contrary to the Scripture; who is an apostate from the will of God. For He answers him, `It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.'[fn-51-P5104_1155251:491-nf] Then, overcome and convicted, the devil departed at that time. But since our Christ was to be numbed, i.e., by pain and experience of suffering, He made a previous intimation of this by touching Jacob's thigh, and causing it to shrink. But Israel was His name from the beginning, to which He altered the name of the blessed Jacob when He blessed him with His own name, proclaiming thereby that all who through Him have fled for refuge to the Father, constitute the blessed Israel. But you, having understood none of this, and not being prepared to understand, since you are the children of Jacob after the fleshly seed, expect that you shall be assuredly saved.

These three there are, and thou canst find nothing whereby human cupidity can be tempted, but either by the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life. By these three was the Lord tempted of the devil.[fn-41-P4128_2256054:61-nf] By the lust of the flesh He was tempted when it was said to Him, \"If thou be the Son of God, speak to these stones that they become bread,\" when He hungered after His fast. But in what way repelled He the tempter, and taught his soldier how to fight? Mark what He said to him: \"Not by bread alone doth man live, but by every word of God.\" He was tempted also by the lust of the eyes concerning a miracle, when he said to Him, \"Cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\" He resisted the tempter, for to do the miracle, would only have been to seem either to have yielded, or to have done it from curiosity; for He wrought when He would, as God, howbeit as healing the weak. For if He had done it then, He might have been thought to wish only to do a miracle. But lest men should think this, mark what He answered; and when the like temptation shall happen to thee, say thou also the same: \"Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" that is, if I do this I shall tempt God. He said what He would have thee to say. When the enemy suggests to thee, \"What sort of man, what sort of Christian, art thou? As yet hast thou done one miracle, or by thy prayers have the dead been raised, or hast thou healed the fevered? if thou wert truly of any moment, thou wouldest do some miracle:\" answer and say: \"It is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" therefore I will not tempt God, as if I should belong to God if I do a miracle, and not belong if I do none: and what becomes then of His words, \"Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven\"? By \"pride of life\" how was the Lord tempted? When he carried Him up to an high place, and said to Him, \"All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" By the loftiness of an earthly kingdom he wished to tempt the King of all worlds: but the Lord who made heaven and earth trod the devil under foot. What great matter for the devil to be conquered by the Lord? Then what did He in the answer He made to the devil but teach thee the answer He would have thee to make? \"It is, written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.\" Holding these things fast, ye shall not have the concupiscence of the world: by not having concupiscence of the world, neither shall the lust of the flesh, nor the lust of the eyes, nor the pride of life, subjugate you: and ye shall make place for Charity when she cometh, that ye may love God. Because if love of the world be there, love of God will not be there. Hold fast rather the love of God, that as God is for ever and ever, so ye also may remain for ever and ever: because such is each one as is his love. Lovest thou earth, thou shall be earth.

God did not command the earth immediately to give forth seed and fruit, but to produce germs, to grow green, and to arrive at maturity in the seed; so that this first command teaches nature what she has to do in the course of ages. But, they ask, is it true that the earth produces seed after his kind, when often, after having sown wheat, we gather black grain? This is not a change of kind, but an alteration, a disease of the grain. It has not ceased to be wheat; it is on account of having been burnt that it is black, as one can learn from its name.[fn-22-P2256_693471:12-nf] If a severe frost had burnt it,[fn-22-P2257_693730:13-nf] it would have had another colour and a different flavour. They even pretend that, if it could find suitable earth and moderate temperature, it might return to its first form. Thus, you find nothing in nature contrary to the divine command. As to the darnel and all those bastard grains which mix themselves with the harvest, the tares of Scripture, far from being a variety of corn, have their own origin and their own kind; image of those who alter the doctrine of the Lord and, not being rightly instructed in the word, but, corrupted by the teaching of the evil one, mix themselves with the sound body of the Church to spread their pernicious errors secretly among purer souls. The Lord thus compares the perfection of those who believe in Him to the growth of seed, \"as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and should sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\"[fn-22-P2258_694908:14-nf] \"Let the earth bring forth grass.\" In a moment earth began by germination to obey the laws of the Creator, completed every stage of growth, and brought germs to perfection. The meadows were covered with deep grass, the fertile plains quivered[fn-22-P2259_695173:15-nf] with harvests, and the movement of the corn was like the waving of the sea. Every plant, every herb, the smallest shrub, the least vegetable, arose from the earth in all its luxuriance. There was no failure in this first vegetation: no husbandman's inexperience, no inclemency of the weather, nothing could injure it; then the sentence of condemnation was not fettering the earth's fertility. All this was before the sin which condemned us to eat our bread by the sweat of our brow.","title":"Homily V.-The Germination of the Earth.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_53_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For my part, I am sorry for this disease, while they are not ashamed to sing the praises of their delicacies, giving themselves great trouble to get lampreys in the Straits of Sicily, the eels of the Maeander, and the kids found in Melos, and the mullets in Sciathus, and the mussels of Pelorus, the oysters of Abydos, not omitting the sprats found in Lipara, and the Mantinican turnip; and furthermore, the beetroot that grows among the Ascraeans: they seek out the cockles of Methymna, the turbots of Attica, and the thrushes of Daphnis, and the reddish-brown dried figs, on account of which the ill-starred Persian marched into Greece with five hundred thousand men. Besides these, they purchase birds from Phasis, the Egyptian snipes, and the Median peafowl. Altering these by means of condiments, the gluttons gape for the sauces. \"Whatever earth and the depths of the sea, and the unmeasured space of the air produce,\" they cater for their gluttony. In their greed and solicitude, the gluttons seem absolutely to sweep the world with a drag-net to gratify their luxurious tastes. These gluttons, surrounded with the sound of hissing frying-pans, and wearing their whole life away at the pestle and mortar, cling to matter like fire. More than that, they emasculate plain food, namely bread, by straining off the nourishing part of the grain, so that the necessary part of food becomes matter of reproach to luxury. There is no limit to epicurism among men. For it has driven them to sweetmeats, and honey-cakes, and sugar-plums; inventing a multitude of desserts, hunting after all manner of dishes. A man like this seems to me to be all jaw, and nothing else. \"Desire not,\" says the Scripture, \"rich men's dainties; \"[fn-37-P3713_1124578:1-nf] for they belong to a false and base life. They partake of luxurious dishes, which a little after go to the dunghill. But we who seek the heavenly bread must role the belly, which is beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it, which \"God shall destroy,\"[fn-37-P3714_1124874:2-nf] says the apostle, justly execrating gluttonous desires. For \"meats are for the belly,\"[fn-37-P3715_1124979:3-nf] for on them depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence[fn-37-P3716_1125064:4-nf] some, speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape,[fn-37-P3717_1125165:5-nf] to pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapae. He says accordingly somewhere, \"When thou art called to a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest place; \"[fn-37-P3718_1126057:6-nf] and elsewhere, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper; \"and again, \"But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,\"[fn-37-P3719_1126200:7-nf] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further, \"A certain man made a great supper, and called many.\"[fn-37-P3720_1126338:8-nf] But I perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: \"from the gullets and furious love for suppers\"-according to the comic poet. For, in truth, \"to many, many things are on account of the supper.\" For they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. \"It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.\"[fn-37-P3721_1127286:9-nf] \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-37-P3722_1127368:10-nf] But the hardest of all cases is for charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that is to be done away with? \"For if,\" it is said, \"I bestow all my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.\"[fn-37-P3723_1127680:11-nf] On this love alone depend the law and the Word; and if \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour,\" this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. \"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,\" says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as ephemeral, \"but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3724_1128287:12-nf] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is communication. \"And the care of discipline is love,\" as Wisdom says; \"and love is the keeping of the law.\"[fn-37-P3725_1128634:13-nf] And these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper. But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, \"Let the children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe on Thee.\"[fn-37-P3726_1129036:14-nf] \"For the righteous shall not live by bread.\"[fn-37-P3727_1129101:15-nf] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point which is beyond the sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for communication; having as its rich provision sufficiency, which, presiding over diet measured in due quantity, and treating the body in a healthful way, distributes something from its resources to those near us, But the diet which exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates his spirit, and renders his body prone to disease. Besides, those dainty tastes, which trouble themselves about rich dishes drive to practices of ill-repute, daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity, insatiability. Appropriate designations of such people as so indulge are flies, weasels, flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of parasites-the one class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and the other life, for the gratification of the belly; crawling on their bellies, beasts in human shape after the image of their father, the voracious beast. People first called the abandoneda0sw/touj, and so appear to me to indicate their end, understanding them as those who are (a0sw/souj) unsaved, excluding the j. For those that are absorbed in pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if they were not to live [hereafter]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah, denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love (agape), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word. \"But they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" And that He reckons such luxury to be sin, is shown by what He adds, \"And your sin shall not be forgiven you till you die,\"[fn-37-P3728_1130943:16-nf] -not conveying the idea that death, which deprives of sensation, is the forgiveness of sin, but meaning that death of salvation which is the recompense of sin. \"Take no pleasure in abominable delicacies, says Wisdom.[fn-37-P3729_1131184:17-nf] At this point, too, we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols, in order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them.

Besides these, they purchase birds from Phasis, the Egyptian snipes, and the Median peafowl. Altering these by means of condiments, the gluttons gape for the sauces. \"Whatever earth and the depths of the sea, and the unmeasured space of the air produce,\" they cater for their gluttony. In their greed and solicitude, the gluttons seem absolutely to sweep the world with a drag-net to gratify their luxurious tastes. These gluttons, surrounded with the sound of hissing frying-pans, and wearing their whole life away at the pestle and mortar, cling to matter like fire. More than that, they emasculate plain food, namely bread, by straining off the nourishing part of the grain, so that the necessary part of food becomes matter of reproach to luxury. There is no limit to epicurism among men. For it has driven them to sweetmeats, and honey-cakes, and sugar-plums; inventing a multitude of desserts, hunting after all manner of dishes. A man like this seems to me to be all jaw, and nothing else. \"Desire not,\" says the Scripture, \"rich men's dainties; \"[fn-37-P3713_1124578:1-nf] for they belong to a false and base life. They partake of luxurious dishes, which a little after go to the dunghill. But we who seek the heavenly bread must role the belly, which is beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it, which \"God shall destroy,\"[fn-37-P3714_1124874:2-nf] says the apostle, justly execrating gluttonous desires. For \"meats are for the belly,\"[fn-37-P3715_1124979:3-nf] for on them depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence[fn-37-P3716_1125064:4-nf] some, speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape,[fn-37-P3717_1125165:5-nf] to pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapae. He says accordingly somewhere, \"When thou art called to a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest place; \"[fn-37-P3718_1126057:6-nf] and elsewhere, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper; \"and again, \"But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,\"[fn-37-P3719_1126200:7-nf] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further, \"A certain man made a great supper, and called many.\"[fn-37-P3720_1126338:8-nf] But I perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: \"from the gullets and furious love for suppers\"-according to the comic poet. For, in truth, \"to many, many things are on account of the supper.\" For they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. \"It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.\"[fn-37-P3721_1127286:9-nf] \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-37-P3722_1127368:10-nf] But the hardest of all cases is for charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that is to be done away with? \"For if,\" it is said, \"I bestow all my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.\"[fn-37-P3723_1127680:11-nf] On this love alone depend the law and the Word; and if \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour,\" this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. \"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,\" says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as ephemeral, \"but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3724_1128287:12-nf] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is communication. \"And the care of discipline is love,\" as Wisdom says; \"and love is the keeping of the law.\"[fn-37-P3725_1128634:13-nf] And these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper. But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, \"Let the children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe on Thee.\"[fn-37-P3726_1129036:14-nf] \"For the righteous shall not live by bread.\"[fn-37-P3727_1129101:15-nf] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties.

It is manifest to us all who possess the Gospel narratives, which Celsus does not appear even to have read, that Jesus selected twelve apostles, and that of these Matthew alone was a tax-gatherer; that when he calls them indiscriminately sailors, he probably means James and John, because they left their ship and their father Zebedee, and followed Jesus; for Peter and his brother Andrew, who employed a net to gain their necessary subsistence, must be classed not as sailors, but as the Scripture describes them, as fishermen. The Lebes[fn-79-P7940_1919782:115-nf] also, who was a follower of Jesus, may have been a tax-gatherer; but he was not of the number of the apostles, except according to a statement in one of the copies of Mark's Gospel.[fn-79-P7941_1919979:116-nf] And we have not ascertained the employments of the remaining disciples, by which they earned their livelihood before becoming disciples of Jesus. I assert, therefore, in answer to such statements as the above, that it is clear to all who are able to institute an intelligent and candid examination into the history of the apostles of Jesus, that it was by help of a divine power that these men taught Christianity, and succeeded in leading others to embrace the word of God. For it was not any power of speaking, or any orderly arrangement of their message, according to the arts of Grecian dialectics or rhetoric, which was in them the effective cause of converting their hearers. Nay, I am of opinion that if Jesus had selected some individuals who were wise according to the apprehension of the multitude, and who were fitted both to think and speak so as to please them, and had used such as the ministers of His doctrine, He would most justly have been suspected of employing artifices, like those philosophers who are the leaders of certain sects, and consequently the promise respecting the divinity of His doctrine would not have manifested itself; for had the doctrine and the preaching consisted in the persuasive utterance and arrangement of words, then faith also, like that of the philosophers of the world in their opinions, would have been through the wisdom of men, and not through the power of God. Now, who is there on seeing fishermen and tax-gatherers, who had not acquired even the merest elements of learning (as the Gospel relates of them, and in respect to which Celsus believes that they speak the truth, inasmuch as it is their own ignorance which they record), discoursing boldly not only among the Jews of faith in Jesus, but also preaching Him with success among other nations, would not inquire whence they derived this power of persuasion, as theirs was certainly not the common method followed by the multitude? And who would not say that the promise, \"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men,\"[fn-79-P7942_1922053:117-nf] had been accomplished by Jesus in the history of His apostles by a sort of divine power? And to this also, Paul, referring in terms of commendation, as we have stated a little above, says: \"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\"[fn-79-P7943_1922470:118-nf] For, according to the predictions in the prophets, foretelling the preaching of the Gospel, \"the Lord gave the word in great power to them who preached it, even the King of the powers of the Beloved,\"[fn-79-P7944_1922699:119-nf] in order that the prophecy might be fulfilled which said, \"His words shall run very swiftly.\"[fn-79-P7945_1922831:120-nf] And we see that \"the voice of the apostles of Jesus has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world,\"[fn-79-P7946_1922983:121-nf] On this account are they who hear the word powerfully proclaimed filled with power, which they manifest both by their dispositions and their lives, and by struggling even to death on behalf of the truth; while some are altogether empty, although they profess to believe in God through Jesus, inasmuch as, not possessing any divine power, they have the appearance only of being converted to the word of God. And although I have previously mentioned a Gospel declaration uttered by the Saviour, I shall nevertheless quote it again, as appropriate to the present occasion, as it confirms both the divine manifestation of our Saviour's foreknowledge regarding the preaching of His Gospel, and the power of His word, which without the aid of teachers gains the mastery over those who yield their assent to persuasion accompanied with divine power; and the words of Jesus referred to are, \"The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.\"[fn-79-P7947_1924035:122-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_38_sermon_xxi_lxxi_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"19. First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first \"gift\" is that which is concerned with the remission of sins; by which blessing \"we are delivered from the power of darkness;\"[fn-39-P3958_1709098:72-nf] and the prince of this world,[fn-39-P3959_1709145:73-nf] who worketh in the children of disobedience\"[fn-39-P3960_1709209:74-nf] by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of sin, is \"cast out\" by our faith.

For \"every man is tempted of his own lust. Then lust when it has conceived beareth sin, and sin when it is consummated begets death.\"[fn-41-P4104_1511974:3-nf] For the first Adam could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had material food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second Adam be tempted without the enticement of some object, when it was said to Him: \"If Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-41-P4105_1512297:4-nf] And it is clear to everybody that fornication also is only completedby a bodily act, as God says of this spirit to the blessed Job: \"And his force is in his loins, and his strength in the navel of his belly.\"[fn-41-P4106_1512525:5-nf] And so these two faults in particular, which are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh, especially require bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the soul; since the determination of the mind is not in itself enough to resist their attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess or the other passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome without any mortification of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be used as well, and be carried out by means of fasting and vigils and acts of contrition; and to this must be added change of scene, because since these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can only be overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the blessed Apostle says generallythat all faults are carnal, since he enumerates enmities and anger and heresies among other works of the flesh,[fn-41-P4107_1513412:6-nf] yet in order to cure them and to discover their nature more exactly we make a twofold division of them: for we call some of them carnal, and some spiritual. And those we call carnal, which specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the flesh, and with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it excites the mind when at rest and even drags it against its will to consent to its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle says: \"In which also we all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.\"[fn-41-P4108_1514056:7-nf] But we call those spiritual which spring only from the impulse of the mind andnot merely contribute no pleasure to the flesh, but actually bring on it a weakness that is harmful to it, and only feed a diseased mind with the food of a most miserable pleasure. And therefore these need a single medicine for the heart: but those which are carnal can only be cured, as we said, by a double remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for those who aspire to purity, to begin by withdrawing from themselves the material which feeds these carnal passions, through which opportunity for or recollection of these same desires can arise in a soul that is still affected by the evil. For a complicated disease needs a complicated remedy. For from the body the object and material which would allure it must be withdrawn, for fear lest the lust should endeavour to break out into act; and before the mind we should no less carefully place diligent meditation on Scripture and watchful anxiety and the withdrawal into solitude, lest it should give birth to desire even in thought. But as regards other faults intercourse with our fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of the greatest possible use, to those who truly desire to get rid of them, because in mixing with others they more often meet with rebuke, and while they are more frequently provoked the existence of the faults is made evident, and so they are cured with speedy remedies.","title":"V.

For it was gluttony through which he took the fruit of the forbidden tree, vainglory through which it was said \"Your eyes shall be opened,\" and pride through which it was said \"Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\"[fn-41-P4120_1518060:11-nf] With these three sins then we read that the Lord our Saviour was also tempted; with gluttony when the devil said to Him: \"Command these stones that they be made bread:\" with vainglory: \"If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down:\"with pride, when he showed him all the kingdoms of the worldand the glory of them and said: \"All this will I give to Thee if Thou wilt fall down and worship me:\"[fn-41-P4121_1518472:12-nf] in order that He might by His example teach us how we ought to vanquish the tempter when we are attacked on the same lines of temptation as He was. And so both the former and the latter are spoken of as Adam; the one being the first for destruction and death, and the other the first for resurrection and life. Through the one the whole race of mankind is brought into condemnation, through the other the whole race of mankind is set free. The one was fashioned out of raw and unformed earth, the other was born of the Virgin Mary. In His case then though it was fitting that He should undergo temptation, yet it was not necessary that He should fail under it. Nor could He who had vanquished gluttony be tempted byfornication, which springs from superfluityand gluttony as its root, with which even the first Adam would not have been destroyed unless before its birth he had been deceived by the wiles of the devil and fallen a victim to passion. And therefore the Son of God is not said absolutely to have come \"in the flesh of sin,\" but \"in the likeness ofthe flesh of sin,\" because though His was true flesh and He ate and drank and slept, and truly received the prints of the nails, there was in Him no true sin inherited from the fall, but only what was something like it. For He had no experience of the fiery darts of carnal lust, which in our case arise even against our will, from the constitution of our natures, but He took upon Him something like this, by sharing in our nature. For as He truly fulfilled every function which belongs to us, and bore all human infirmities, He has consequently been considered to have been subject to this feeling also, that He might appear through these infirmities to bear in His own flesh the state even of this fault and sin. Lastly the devil only tempted Him to those sins, by which he had deceived the first Adam, inferring that He as manwould similarly be deceived in other matters if he found that He was overcome by those temptations by which he had overthrown His predecessor. But as he was overthrown in the first encounter he was not able to bring upon Him the second infirmity which had shot up as from the root of the first fault. For he saw that He had not even admitted anything from which this infirmity might take its rise, and it was idle to hope for the fruit of sin from Him, as he saw that He in no sort of way received into Himself seeds or roots of it. Yet according to Luke, who places last that temptation in which he uses the words \"If Thou art the Son of God, cast Thyself down,\"[fn-41-P4122_1521043:13-nf] we can understand this of the feeling of pride, so that that earlier one, which Matthew places third, in which, as Luke the evangelist says, the devil showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and promised them to Him, may be taken of the feeling of covetousness, because after His victory over gluttony, he did not venture to tempt Him to fornication, but passed on to covetousness, which he knew to be the root of all evils,[fn-41-P4123_1521509:14-nf] and when again vanquished inthis, he did not dare attack Him with any of those sins which follow, which, as he knew full well, spring from this as a root and source; and so he passed on to the last passion; viz., pride, by which he knew that those who are perfect and have overcome all other sins, can be affected, and owing to which he remembered that he himself in his character of Lucifer, and many others too, had fallen from their heavenly estate, without temptation from any of the preceding passions. In this order then which we have mentioned, which is the one given by the evangelist Luke, there is an exact agreement between the allurements and forms of the temptations by which that most crafty foe attacked both the first and the second Adam. For to the one he said \"Your eyes shall be opened;\" to theother \"he showed all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.\" In the one case he said \"Ye shall be as gods;\" in the other, \"If Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-41-P4124_1522505:15-nf] ","title":"V.

We will marry if we wish, and bring up the children given to us in marriage; and if need be, we will not only partake of the blessings of life, but bear its appointed sorrows as a trial to our souls.

Moreover, if any one \"by transgressing the law dishonours the lawgiver,\" it seems clear to us that if the two laws, the law of God and the law of mammon, are completely opposed to each other, it is better for us by transgressing the law of mammon to dishonour mammon, that we may honour God by keeping His law, than by transgressing the law of God to dishonour God, that by obeying the law of mammon we may honour mammon.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":50,"source_paragraph":"267","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"113.

This form, therefore, you did not receive even from the Jewish persecutors themselves, for they persecuted His body while He was walking on the earth: you persecute His gospel as He is seated in heaven.

Hear now how that this is the meaning of \"offence.\" I have brought forward the example of Job and his wife; but there the word \"offence\" did not occur. Hear the Gospel: when the Lord prophesied of His Passion, Peter began to persuade him not to suffer. \"Get thee behind Me, Satan, thou art an offence to Me.\"[fn-43-P4398_1867885:15-nf] Here undoubtedly the Lord who hath given thee an example of life, hath taught thee both what an \"offence\" is, and how an offence is to be avoided.

Thy friend who loves thee, and is loved by thee again, thy father, thy brother, thy child, thy wife, sees thee in an evil case, and would have thee do what is evil. What do I mean by \"sees thee in an evil case\"? Sees thee in some press of trouble. This pressure it may be thou art suffering for righteousness' sake; art suffering it because thou will not give false witness. I would speak merely by way of illustration. Examples abound; for \"woe to the world, because of offences.\" See, for instance, some powerful person, to cover his rapine and plunder, asks of you the service of a false witness. You refuse: refuse the false oath, lest thou shouldest deny Him that is true. That I may not dwell long on this, he is angry, he is powerful, he oppresses thee: a friend comes who would not have thee in this press of trouble, in this evil case; \"I pray thee, do what is told thee; what great matter is it?\" And then perhaps as Satan with the Lord, \"It is written of Thee, He shall give His Angels charge concerning Thee, that Thou dash not Thy foot against a stone.\"[fn-44-P4400_1869592:17-nf] Perhaps too this friend of thine, because he sees thou art a Christian, wishes to persuade thee out of the Law to do what he thinks you ought to do. \"Do what the other tells.\" \"What? Do what the other wishes.\" \"But it is a lie, it is false.\" \"Well, have you not read, `All men are liars'?\"[fn-44-P4401_1869900:18-nf] Now is he an \"offence.\" He is a friend, what will you do? He is an eye, he is a hand: \"Cut it off, and cast it from thee.\" What is, \"cut it off, and cast it from thee\"? Consent not to him. For members in our body make up unity by consent, by consent they live, by consent are joined together one with the other. Where there is dissent, there is disease, or a sore.

Therefore He suffered them not to speak such words, neither would He have us to suffer such, but hath charged us by His own mouth, saying, `Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheeps' clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves[fn-39-P3934_1654079:18-nf] ;' and by the mouth of His Holy Apostles, `Believe not every spirit[fn-39-P3935_1654167:19-nf] .'

For if men take a pride in the mere fact of speaking eulogies of kings, even if there be no other fruit of it; consider how glorious it must be, that our Lord is glorified by us: as again, how great a punishment to cause Him to be by our means blasphemed. And yet this very being glorified, He wisheth to be brought about for our sakes, since He doth not need it Himself. For what distance dost thou suppose to be between God and man? as great as that between men and worms? or as great as between Angels and worms? But when I have mentioned a distance even thus great, I have not at all expressed it: since to express its greatness is impossible. Would you, now, wish to have a great and marked reputation among worms? Surely not. If then thou that lovest glory, wouldest not wish for this, how should He Who is far removed from this passion, and so much farther above us, stand in need of glory from thee? Nevertheless, free from the want of it as He is, still He saith that He desireth it for thy sake.

For it says, \"flee from sin, as from the face of a serpent: if thou comest too near unto it, it will bite thee\" (Ecclus. xxi. 2): for it is not it that comes to us, but we that desert to it. God has so ordered things that the Devil should not prevail over us by compulsion (Gr. tyranny): since else none would have stood against his might. And on this account He set him a distant abode, as a kind of robber and tyrant.[fn-23-P2330_2256750:27-nf] And unless he find a person unarmed and solitary for his assaults, he doth not venture to attack him.

Need we have of continual prayer that he may be bruised under our feet, for he is shameless and full of hardihood, and this though he fights from beneath. But yet even so he gets the victory: and the reason is, that we are not earnestly set upon being above his blows. For he has not even the power to lift himself very high, but he trails along upon the ground. And of this the serpent is a type. But if God set him in that rank from the beginning, much more will He now. But if thou dost not know what fighting from beneath may be, I also will try to explain to thee the manner of this war. What then may this fighting \"from beneath\" (John viii. 23) be? It is standing upon the lower things of the world to buffet us, such as pleasure and riches and all the goods of this life. And for this reason, whoever he seeth flying toward heaven, first, he will not even be able to leap so far. Secondly, even if he should attempt he will speedily fall. For he hath no feet; be not afraid: he hath no wings; fear not. He trails upon the earth, and the things of the earth.

For we have, we surely have, spiritual charms, even the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the might of the Cross. This charm will not only bring the serpent out of his lurking places, and cast him into the fire (Acts xxviii. 5), but even wounds it healeth. But if some that have said this Name have not been healed, it came of their own little faith, and was not owing to any weakness in what they said. For some did throng Jesus and press. Him (Luke viii. 44, Luke viii. 45), and got no good therefrom. But the woman with an issue, without even touching His Body, but merely the hem of His garment, stanched a flux of blood of so long standing. (So St. Aug. Serm. LXII. iii. 4, P. 124 O. T.)

Let us then imitate him. Let us allow Christ to speak through us. He desireth it more than we do: and by reason of this, He prepared this instrument, and would not have it remain useless and idle, but wisheth to keep it ever in hand.

For He adds, \"The Lord will deliver him out of them all.\" And this is just in accordance with the Saviour's word, whereby He promises that they will overcome their afflictions, and that they will participate in that victory which He has won for them. For after saying, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation,\" He added, \"But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" And again, He taught them to pray that they might not fall into temptation, when He said, \"And lead us not into temptation; \"which means, \"Suffer us not to fall into temptation.\" And to show that this did not imply they should not be tempted, but really that they should be delivered from the evil, He added, \"But deliver us from evil.\" But perhaps you will say, What difference is there between being tempted, and falling or entering into temptation? Well, if one is overcome of evil-and he will be overcome unless he struggles against it himself, and unless God protects him with His shield-that man has entered into temptation, and is in it, and is brought under it like one that is led captive. But if one withstands and endures, that man is indeed tempted; but he has not entered into temptation, or fallen under it. Thus Jesus was led up of the Spirit, not indeed to enter into temptation, but \"to be tempted of the devil.\"[fn-20-P2057_594166:9-nf] And Abraham, again, did not enter into temptation, neither did God lead him into temptation, but He tempted (tried) him; yet He did not drive him into temptation. The Lord Himself, moreover, tempted (tried) the disciples. And thus the wicked one, when he tempts us, draws us into the temptations, as dealing himself with the temptations of evil; but God, when He tempts (tries), adduces the temptations as one untempted of evil. For God, it is said, \"cannot be tempted of evil.\"[fn-20-P2058_594662:10-nf] The devil, therefore, drives us on by violence, drawing us to destruction; but God leads us by the hand, training us for our salvation.

As when some injuries come upon us, which are caused either by toil laid upon us or by a bad atmosphere, it is generally the case in the bodies of men that those which are the weaker are the first to give in and yield to those chances, and when the disease has more particularly laid hold of them, it affects the sound parts of the body also with the same mischief, so also, when the pestilent blast of sin breathes over us the soul of each one of us is sure to be tempted above all by that passion, in the case of which its feebler and weaker portion does not make so stubborn a resistance to the powerful attacks of the foe, and to run the risk of being taken captive by those, in the case of which a careless watch opens an easier way to betrayal. For so Balsam[fn-67-P6764_2422942:25-nf] gathered that God's people could be by a sure method deceived, when he advised, that in that quarter, wherein he knew that the children of Israel were weak, the dangerous snares should be set for them, as he had no doubt that when a supply of women was offered to them, they would at once fall and be destroyed by fornication, because he was aware that the parts of their souls which were subject to desire were corrupted. So then the spiritual wickednesses tempt with crafty malice each one of us, by particularly laying insidious snares for those affections of the soul, in which they have seen that it is weak, as for instance, if they see that the reasonable parts of our soul are affected, they try to deceive us in the same way that the Scripture tells us that king Ahab was deceived by those Syrians, who said: \"We know that the kings of Israel are merciful: And so let us put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes round our heads, and go out to the king of Israel, and say to him: Thy servant Benhadad saith: I pray thee, let my soul live.\" And thereby he was affected by no true goodness, but by the empty praise of his clemency, and said: \"If he still liveth, he is my brother;\" and after this fashion they can deceive us also by the error of that reasonable part, and make us incur the displeasure of God owing to that from which we were hoping that we might gain a reward and receive the recompense of goodness, and to us too the same rebuke may be addressed: \"Because thou hast let go from thy hand a man who was worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his people\"[fn-67-P6765_2424575:26-nf] Or when the unclean spirit says: \"I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets,\"[fn-67-P6766_2424709:27-nf] he certainly spread the nets of deception by means of the reasonable feeling which he knew to be exposed to his deadly wiles. And this also the same spirit expected in the case of our Lord, when he tempted Him in these three affections of the soul, wherein he knew that all mankind had been taken captive, but gained nothing by his crafty wiles. For he approached that portion of his mind which was subject to desire, when he said: \"Command that these stones be made bread;\" the part subject to wrath, when he tried to incite Him to seek the power of the present life and the kingdoms of this world; the reasonable part when he said: \"If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down from hence.\"[fn-67-P6767_2425431:28-nf] And in these his deception availed nothing for this reason because he found that there was nothing damaged in Him, in accordance with the supposition which he had formed from a false idea.

Or otherwise, \"He that loveth his life shall lose it.\" Do not love for fear of losing; love it not here, lest thou lose it in eternity. But what I have said last seems better to correspond with the meaning of the Gospel, for there follow the words, \"And he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\" So that when it is said in the previous clause, \"He that loveth,\" there is to be understood in this world, he it is that shall lose it. \"But he that hateth,\" that is, in this world, is he that shall keep it unto life eternal. Surely a profound and strange declaration as to the measure of a man's love for his own life that leads to its destruction, and of his hatred to it that secures its preservation! If in a sinful way thou lovest it, then dost thou really hate it; if in a way accordant with what is good thou hast hated it, then hast thou really loved it. Happy they who have so hated their life while keeping it, that their love shall not cause them to lose it. But beware of harboring the notion that thou mayest court self-destruction by any such understanding of thy duty to hate thy life in this world. For on such grounds it is that certain wrong-minded and perverted people, who, with regard to themselves, are murderers of a specially cruel and impious character, commit themselves to the flames, suffocate themselves in water, dash themselves against a precipice, and perish.

For notice what is immediately subjoined by thy Creator and thy Master, by Him who made thee, and became Himself for thy teaching that which He made; for He who made man was made man, but He remained still the unchangeable God, and transplanted manhood into a better condition. Listen, then, to what He adds to the words, \"Now is my soul troubled.\" \"And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify Thy name.\" He has taught thee here what to think of, what to say, on whom to call, in whom to hope, and whose will, as sure and divine, to prefer to thine own, which is human and weak. Imagine Him not, therefore, as losing aught of His own exalted position in wishing thee to rise up out of the depths of thy ruin. For He thought it meet also to be tempted by the devil, by whom otherwise He would never have been tempted, just as, had He not been willing, He would never have suffered; and the answers He gave to the devil are such as thou also oughtest to use in times of temptation.[fn-22-P2264_1387119:3-nf] And He, indeed, was tempted, but not endangered, that He might show thee, when in danger through temptation, how to answer the tempter, so as not to be carried away by the temptation, but to escape its danger. But when He here said, \"Now is my soul troubled;\" and also when He says, \"My soul is sorrowful, even unto death;\" and \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;\" He assumed the infirmity of man, to teach him, when thereby saddened and troubled, to say what follows: \"Nevertheless, Father, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-22-P2265_1387683:4-nf] For thus it is that man is turned from the human to the divine, when the will of God is preferred to his own.

But God, who is good, multiplied His loving-kindness towards us, not only when He granted the common salvation of us all through His Word, but now also, when enemies have persecuted us, and have sought to seize upon us. As the blessed Paul saith in a certain place, when describing the incomprehensible riches of Christ: `But God, being rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in follies and sins, quickened us with Christ[fn-92-P9240_3354086:16-nf] .' For the might of man and of all creatures, is weak and poor; but the Might which is above man, and uncreated, is rich and incomprehensible, and has no beginning, but is eternal. Hedoes not then possess one method only of healing, but being rich, He works in divers manners for our salvation by means of His Word, Who is not restricted or hindered in His dealings towards us; but since He is rich and manifold, He varies Himself according to the individual capacity of each soul. For He is the Word and the Power and the Wisdom of God, as Solomon testifies concerning Wisdom, that `being one, it can do all things, and remaining in itself, it maketh all things new; and passing upon holy souls, fashioneth the friends of God and the prophets[fn-92-P9241_3354859:17-nf] .' To those then who have not yet attained to the perfect way He becomes like a sheep giving milk, and this was administered by Paul: `I have fed you with milk, not with meat[fn-92-P9242_3355065:18-nf] .' To those who have advanced beyond the full stature of childhood, but still are weak as regards perfection, He is their food, according to their capacity, being again administered by Paul[fn-92-P9243_3355275:19-nf] , `Let him that is weak eat herbs.' But as soon as ever a man begins to walk in the perfect way, he is no longer fed with the things before mentioned, but he has the Word for bread, and flesh for food, for it is written, `Strong meat is for those who are of full age, for those who, by reason of their capacity, have their senses exercised[fn-92-P9244_3355920:20-nf] .' And further, when the word is sown it does not yield a uniform produce of fruit in this human life, but one various and rich; for it bringeth forth, some an hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty[fn-92-P9245_3356138:21-nf] , as the Saviour teaches-that Sower of grace, and Bestower of the Spirit[fn-92-P9246_3356618:22-nf] . And this is no doubtful matter, nor one that admits no confirmation; but it is in our power to behold the field which is sown by Him; for in the Church the word is manifold and the produce[fn-92-P9247_3356833:23-nf] rich. Not with virgins alone is such a field adorned; nor with monks alone but also with honourable matrimony and the chastity of each one. For in sowing, He did not compel the will beyond the power. Nor is mercy confined to the perfect, but it is sent down also among those who occupy the middle and the third ranks, so that He might rescue all men generally to salvation. To this intent He hath prepared many mansions[fn-92-P9248_3357322:24-nf] with the Father, so that although the dwelling-place is various in proportion to the advance in moral attainment, yet all of us are within the wall, and all of us enter within the same fence, the adversary being cast out, and all his host expelled thence. For apart from light there is darkness, and apart from blessing there is a curse, the devil also is apart from the saints, and sin far from virtue. Therefore the Gospel rebukes Satan, saying, `Get thee behind Me, Satan[fn-92-P9249_3357814:25-nf] .' But us it calls to itself, saying, `Enter ye in at the strait gate.' And again, `Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom which is prepared for you[fn-92-P9250_3357991:26-nf] .' So also the Spirit cried aforetime in the Psalms, saying, `Enter into His gates with psalms[fn-92-P9251_3358121:27-nf] .' For through virtue a man enters in unto God, as Moses did into the thick cloud where God was. But through vice a man goes out from the presence of the Lord; as Cain[fn-92-P9252_3358304:28-nf] when he had slain his brother, went out, as far as his will was concerned, from before the face of God; and the Psalmist enters, saying, `And I will go in to the altar of God, even to the God that delighteth my youth[fn-92-P9253_3358552:29-nf] .' But of the devil the Scripture beareth witness, that the devil went out from before God, and smote Job[fn-92-P9254_3358677:30-nf] with sore boils. For this is the characteristic of those who go out from before God-to smite and to injure the men of God. And this is the characteristic of those who fall away from the faith-to injure and persecute the faithful. The saints on the other hand, take such to themselves and look upon them as friends; as also the blessed David, using openness of speech, says, `Mine eyes are on the faithful of the earth, that they may dwell with me.' But those that are weak in the faith[fn-92-P9255_3359227:31-nf] , Paul urges that we should especially take to ourselves. For virtue is philanthropic[fn-92-P9256_3359342:32-nf] , just as in men of an opposite character, sin is misanthropic. So Saul, being a sinner, persecuted David, whereas David, though he had a goodopportunity, did not kill Saul. Esau too persecuted Jacob, while Jacob overcame his wickedness by meekness.

What then? The rest looked upon one another; but the ever fervent Peter \"beckoneth\"[fn-40-P4034_1341054:8-nf] to John. Since he had been before rebuked, and when Christ desired to wash him would have hindered Him, and since he is everywhere found moved indeed by love, vet blamed; being on this account afraid, heneither kept quiet, nor did he speak, but wished to gain information by means of John. But it is a question worth asking, why when all were distressed, and trembling, when their leader was afraid, John like one at ease[fn-40-P4035_1341730:9-nf] leans on Jesus' bosom, and not only leans, but even (lies) on His breast? Nor is this the only thing worthy of enquiry, but that also which follows. What is that? What he saith of himself, \"Whom Jesus loved.\" Why did no one else say this of himself? yet the others were loved too. But he more than any. And if no other hath said this about him, but he about himself, it is nothing wonderful. Paul too does the samed[fn-40-P4036_1342162:10-nf] when occasion calls, saying thus, \"I knew a man fourteen years ago\"; yet in fact he[fn-40-P4037_1342275:11-nf] has gone through other no trifling praises of himself. Seems it to thee a small thing that, when he had heard, \"FollowMe,\"[fn-40-P4038_1342413:12-nf] he straightway left his nets, and his father, and followed; and that Christ took him alone with Peter into the mountain, (Matt. xvii. 1,) and another time again when He went into a house?[fn-40-P4039_1342645:13-nf] (Luke viii. 51.) What high praise also has he himself passed on Peter without concealment, telling us that Christ said, \"Peter,[fn-40-P4040_1342789:14-nf] lovest thou Me more than these?\" (c. xxi. 15), and everywhere he showeth him warm, and nobly disposed towards himself;[fn-40-P4041_1342936:15-nf] for instance, when he said, \"Lord, and what shall this man do?\" he spake from great love. But why did[fn-40-P4042_1343066:16-nf] no other say (this[fn-40-P4043_1343118:17-nf] ) concerning him? Because he would not himself have said it, unless he had come to this passage.[fn-40-P4044_1343248:18-nf] For if after telling us that Peter beckoned to John to ask, he had added nothing more, he would have caused considerable doubt, and have compelled us to enquire into the reason. In order therefore himself to solve this difficulty, he saith, \"He lay on the bosom of Jesus.\" Thinkest thou that thou hast learnt a little thing when thou hast heard that \"he lay,\" and that their Master allowed such boldness to them?[fn-40-P4045_1343694:19-nf] If thou desirest to know the cause of this, the action was of love;[fn-40-P4046_1343788:20-nf] wherefore he saith, \"Whom Jesus loved.\"[fn-40-P4047_1343843:21-nf] I suppose also that John doth this for another reason, as wishing to show that he was exempt from the charge and so he speaks openly and is confident. Again, why did he use these words, not at any other point of time,[fn-40-P4048_1344075:22-nf] but only when the chief of the Apostles beckoned? That thou mightest not deem that Peter beckoned to him as being greater, he saith that the thing took place because of the great love (which Jesus bare him). But why doth he even lie on His bosom?

If they were troubled in their souls, much more would they be so in their countenances.

For on the fourth day, as we read, God said: \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, and let them shine upon the earth, and let them divide between day and night, and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, and let them be in the firmament of heaven that they may shine upon earth.\"","title":"Sermon XXVII.

But \"stronger is He that is in us than He that is against us[fn-33-P3350_823004:3-nf] ,\" and through Him are we powerful in whose strength we rely: because it was for this that the Lord allowed Himself to be tempted by the tempter, that we might be taught by His example as well as fortified by His aid. For He conquered the adversary, as ye have heard[fn-33-P3351_823292:4-nf] , by quotations from the law, not by actual strength, that by this very thing He might do greater honour to man, and inflict a greater punishment on the adversary by conquering the enemy of the human race not now as God but as Man. He fought then, therefore, that we too might fight thereafter: He conquered that we too might likewise conquer. For there are no works of power, dearly-beloved, without the trials of temptations, there is no faith without proof, no contest without a foe, no victory without conflict.

Moreover, as to this word which is written in the Gospel, \"Ye are of your father the devil,\"[fn-35-P3558_979737:288-nf] and so forth, we say in brief that there is a devil working in us, whose aim it has been, in the strength of his own will, to make us like himself. For all the creatures that God made, He made very good; and He gave to every individual the sense of free-will, in accordance with which standard He also instituted the law of judgment. To sin is ours, and that we sin not is God's gift, as our will is constituted to choose either to sin or not to sin. And this you doubtless understand well enough yourself, Manes; for you know that, although you were to bring together all your disciples and admonish[fn-35-P3559_980360:289-nf] them not to commit any transgression or do any unrighteousness, every one of them might still pass by the law of judgment. And certainly whosoever will, may keep the commandments; and whosoever shall despise them, and turn aside to what is contrary to them, shall yet without doubt have to face this law of judgment. Hence also certain of the angels, refusing to submit themselves to the commandment of God, resisted His will; and one of them indeed fell like a flash of lightning[fn-35-P3560_980914:290-nf] upon the earth, while others,[fn-35-P3561_980963:291-nf] harassed by the dragon, sought their felicity in intercourse with the daughters of men,[fn-35-P3562_981523:292-nf] and thus brought on themselves the merited award of the punishment of eternal fire. And that angel who was cast down to earth, finding no further admittance into any of the regions of heaven, now flaunts about among men, deceiving them, and luring them to become transgressors like himself, and even to this day he is an adversary to the commandments of God. The example of his fall and ruin, however, will not be followed by all, inasmuch as to each is given liberty of will. For this reason also has he obtained the name of devil, because he has passed over from the heavenly places, and appeared on earth as the disparager of God's commandment.[fn-35-P3563_982581:293-nf] But because it was God who first gave the commandment, the Lord Jesus Himself said to the devil, \"Get thee behind me, Satan; \"[fn-35-P3564_982917:294-nf] and, without doubt, to go behind God is the sign of being His servant. And again He says, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-35-P3565_983098:295-nf] Wherefore, as certain men were inclined to yield obedience to his wishes, they were addressed in these terms by the Saviour: \"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts. of your father ye will do.\"[fn-35-P3566_983321:296-nf] And, in fine, when they are found to be actually doing his will, they are thus addressed: \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.\"[fn-35-P3567_983561:297-nf] From all this, then, you ought to see how weighty a matter it is for man to have freedom of will, However, let my antagonist here say whether there is a judgment for the godly and the ungodly, or not. Manes said: There is a judgment. Archelaus said: I think that what we[fn-35-P3568_983855:298-nf] have said concerning the devil contains no small measure of reason as well as of piety. For every creature, moreover, has its own order; and there is one order for the human race, and another for animals, and another for angels. Furthermore, there is but one only inconvertible substance, the divine substance, eternal and invisible, as is known to all, and as is also borne out by this scripture: \"No man hath seen God at any time, save the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.\"[fn-35-P3569_984407:299-nf] All the other creatures, consequently, are of necessity visible,-such as heaven, earth, sea, men, angels, archangels. But if God has not been seen by any man at any time, what consubstantiality can there be between Him and those creatures? Hence we hold that all things whatsoever have, in their several positions, their own proper substances, according to their proper order. You, on the other band, allege that every living thing which moves is made of one,[fn-35-P3570_984886:300-nf] and you say that every object has received like substance from God, and that this substance is capable of sinning and of being brought under the judgment; and you are unwilling to accept the word which declares that the devil was an angel, and that he fell in transgression, and that he is not of the same substance with God. Logically, you ought to do away with any allowance of the doctrine of a judgment, and that would make it clear which of us is in error.[fn-35-P3571_985363:301-nf] If, indeed, the angel that has been created by God is incapable of falling in transgression, how can the soul, as a part of God, be capable of sinning? But, again, if yon say that there is a judgment for sinning souls, and if you hold also that these are of one substance with God; and if still, even although you maintain that they are of the divine nature, you affirm that, notwithstanding that fact, they do not keep[fn-35-P3572_986615:302-nf] the commandments of God, then, even on such grounds, my argument will pass very well,[fn-35-P3573_986938:303-nf] which avers that the devil fell first, on account of his failure to keep the commandments of God. He was not indeed of the substance of God. And he fell, not so much to do hurt to the race of man, as rather to be set at nought[fn-35-P3574_987229:304-nf] by the same.

And again He says, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-35-P3565_983098:295-nf] Wherefore, as certain men were inclined to yield obedience to his wishes, they were addressed in these terms by the Saviour: \"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts. of your father ye will do.\"[fn-35-P3566_983321:296-nf] And, in fine, when they are found to be actually doing his will, they are thus addressed: \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.\"[fn-35-P3567_983561:297-nf] From all this, then, you ought to see how weighty a matter it is for man to have freedom of will, However, let my antagonist here say whether there is a judgment for the godly and the ungodly, or not. Manes said: There is a judgment. Archelaus said: I think that what we[fn-35-P3568_983855:298-nf] have said concerning the devil contains no small measure of reason as well as of piety. For every creature, moreover, has its own order; and there is one order for the human race, and another for animals, and another for angels. Furthermore, there is but one only inconvertible substance, the divine substance, eternal and invisible, as is known to all, and as is also borne out by this scripture: \"No man hath seen God at any time, save the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.\"[fn-35-P3569_984407:299-nf] All the other creatures, consequently, are of necessity visible,-such as heaven, earth, sea, men, angels, archangels. But if God has not been seen by any man at any time, what consubstantiality can there be between Him and those creatures? Hence we hold that all things whatsoever have, in their several positions, their own proper substances, according to their proper order. You, on the other band, allege that every living thing which moves is made of one,[fn-35-P3570_984886:300-nf] and you say that every object has received like substance from God, and that this substance is capable of sinning and of being brought under the judgment; and you are unwilling to accept the word which declares that the devil was an angel, and that he fell in transgression, and that he is not of the same substance with God. Logically, you ought to do away with any allowance of the doctrine of a judgment, and that would make it clear which of us is in error.[fn-35-P3571_985363:301-nf] If, indeed, the angel that has been created by God is incapable of falling in transgression, how can the soul, as a part of God, be capable of sinning? But, again, if yon say that there is a judgment for sinning souls, and if you hold also that these are of one substance with God; and if still, even although you maintain that they are of the divine nature, you affirm that, notwithstanding that fact, they do not keep[fn-35-P3572_986615:302-nf] the commandments of God, then, even on such grounds, my argument will pass very well,[fn-35-P3573_986938:303-nf] which avers that the devil fell first, on account of his failure to keep the commandments of God. He was not indeed of the substance of God. And he fell, not so much to do hurt to the race of man, as rather to be set at nought[fn-35-P3574_987229:304-nf] by the same. For He \"gave unto us power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the strength of the enemy.\"[fn-35-P3575_987482:305-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-06","text":"44. Now this word also has the veil. For up to the time of Herod they did appear to retain a kingdom in some sort; and it was by Augustus that the first enrolment took place among them, and that they began to pay tribute, and to be rated.[fn-38-P3800_1069196:516-nf] Now it was also from the time when our Lord Jesus Christ began to be prophesied of and looked for that there began to be princes from Judah and leaders of the people; and these, again, failed just at the approach of His advent. If, then, the veil is taken away which is put on in that reading of theirs, they will understand the true virtue of the circumcision; and they will also discover that the generation of Him whom we preach, and His cross, and all the things that have happened in the history of our Lord, are those very matters which had been predicted of that Prophet. And I could wish, indeed, to examine every such passage of Scripture by itself, and to point out its import, as it is meet that it should be understood.[fn-38-P3801_1069948:517-nf] But as it is another subject that is now urgent, these passages shall be discussed by us at some season of leisure. For at present, what I have already said may be sufficient for the purpose of showing, that it is not without reason that the veil is (said to be) put upon the heart of certain persons in the reading of the Old Testament. But those who turn to the Lordsh all have the veil taken away from them. What precise force all these things, however, may possess, I leave to the apprehension of those who have sound intelligence. Let us come now again to that word of Moses, in which he says: \"The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet unto you, of your brethren, like unto me.\" In this saying I perceive a great prophecy delivered by the servant Moses, as by one cognizant[fn-38-P3802_1070879:518-nf] that He who is to come is indeed to be possessed of greater authority than himself, and nevertheless is to suffer like things with him, and to show like signs and wonders. For there, Moses after his birth was placed by his mother in an ark, and exposed beside the banks of the river;[fn-38-P3803_1071311:519-nf] here, our Lord Jesus Christ, after His birth by Mary His mother, was sent off in flight into Egypt through the instrumentality of an angel.[fn-38-P3804_1071466:520-nf] There, Moses led forth his people from the midst of the Egyptians, and saved them;[fn-38-P3805_1071570:521-nf] and here, Jesus, leading forth His people from the midst of the Pharisees, transferred them to an eternal salvation.[fn-38-P3806_1071703:522-nf] There, Moses sought bread by prayer, and received it from heaven, in order that he might feed the people with it in the wilderness;[fn-38-P3807_1071857:523-nf] here, my Lord Jesus by His own power satisfied[fn-38-P3808_1071920:524-nf] with five loaves five thousand men in the wilderness.[fn-38-P3809_1072041:525-nf] There, Moses when he was tried was set upon the mountain and fasted forty days;[fn-38-P3810_1072139:526-nf] and here, my Lord Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness when He was tempted of the devil, and fasted in like manner forty days.[fn-38-P3811_1072295:527-nf] There, before the sight of Moses, all the first-born of the Egyptians perished on account of the treachery of Pharaoh;[fn-38-P3812_1072434:528-nf] and here, at the time of the birth of Jesus, every male among the Jews suddenly perished by reason of the treachery of Herod.[fn-38-P3813_1072576:529-nf] There, Moses prayed that Pharaoh and his people might be spared the plagues;[fn-38-P3814_1072674:530-nf] and here, our Lord Jesus prayed that the Pharisees might be pardoned, when He said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-38-P3815_1072831:531-nf] There, the countenance of Moses shone with the glory of the Lord, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look upon his face, on account of the glory of his countenance;[fn-38-P3816_1073036:532-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus Christ shone like the sun,[fn-38-P3817_1073110:533-nf] and His disciples were not able to look upon His face by reason of the glory of His countenance and the intense splendour of the light. There, Moses smote down with the sword those who had set up the calf;[fn-38-P3818_1073338:534-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus said, \"I came to send a sword upon the earth, and to set a man at variance with his neighbour,\"[fn-38-P3819_1073477:535-nf] and so on. There, Moses went without fear into the darkness of the clouds that carry water;[fn-38-P3820_1073589:536-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus walked with all power upon the waters.[fn-38-P3821_1073674:537-nf] There, Moses gave his commands to the sea;[fn-38-P3822_1073739:538-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus, when he was on the sea,[fn-38-P3823_1073805:539-nf] rose and gave His commands to the winds and the sea.[fn-38-P3824_1073933:540-nf] There, Moses, when he was assailed, stretched forth his hands and fought against Amalek;[fn-38-P3825_1074045:541-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus, when we were assailed and were perishing by the violence of that erring spirit who works now hi the just,[fn-38-P3826_1074194:542-nf] stretched forth His hands upon the cross, and gave us salvation. But there are indeed many other matters of this kind which I must pass by, my dearly beloved Diodorus, as I am in haste to send veil this little book with all convenient speed; and these omissions of mine you will be able yourself to supply very easily by your own intelligence. Write me, however, an account of all that this servant of the adversary's cause may do hereafter.

Manes said: No one, certainly, who may be able to give a reply to what has just been alleged by you need fear incurring the guilt of blasphemy, but should rather be deemed thoroughly worthy of all commendation. For a true master of his art,[fn-39-P3904_1111510:614-nf] when any matters are brought under his notice, ought to prepare his reply with due care, and make all clearly to understand the points that are in question or under doubt; and most especially ought he to do so to uninstructed persons. Now since the account of our doctrine does not satisfy you, be pleased, like a thorough master of your art, to solve this question also for me in a reasonable manner. For to me it seems but pious to say that the Son of God stood in need of nothing whatsoever in the way of making good His advent upon earth; and that He in no sense required either the dove, or baptism, or mother, or brethren, or even mayhap a father,-which father, however, according to your view, was Joseph; but that He descended altogether by Himself alone, and transformed Himself, according to His own good pleasure, into the semblance of a man, in accordance with that word of Paul which tells us that \"He was found in fashion as a man.\"[fn-39-P3905_1112474:615-nf] Show me, therefore, what thing He could possibly need who was able to transform Himself into all manner of appearances. For when He chose to do so, He again transformed this human fashion[fn-39-P3906_1112682:616-nf] and mien into the likeness of the sun.But if you gainsay me once more, and decline to acknowledge that I state the faith correctly, listen to my definition of the position in which you stand. For if you say that He was only man as born of Mary,[fn-39-P3907_1112943:617-nf] and that He received the Spirit at His baptism, it will follow that He will be made out to be Son by increase[fn-39-P3908_1113093:618-nf] and not by nature. If, however, I grant you to say that He is Son according to increase,[fn-39-P3909_1113216:619-nf] and that He was made as a man, your opinion is that He is really a man, that is to say, one who is flesh and blood.[fn-39-P3910_1113370:620-nf] But then it will necessarily follow that the Spirit also who appeared like a dove was nothing else than a natural dove. For the two expressions are the same,-namely, \"as a man\" and \"like[fn-39-P3911_1113735:621-nf] a dove; \"and consequently whatever may be the view you take of the one passage which uses the phrase \"as a man,\" you ought to hold that same view[fn-39-P3912_1113896:622-nf] also of this other passage in which the expression \"like a dove\" is used. It is a clear matter of necessity to take these things in the same way, for only thus can we find out the real sense of what is written concerning Him in the Scriptures. Archelaus said: As you cannot do so much for yourself, like a thorough master of your art, so neither should I care to put this question right and with all patience to make it clear, and to give the evident solution of the difficulty,[fn-39-P3913_1114476:623-nf] were it not for the sake of those who are present with us, and who listen to us. For this reason, therefore, I shall also explain the answer that ought to be given to this question as it may be done most appropriately. It does not seem to you, then, to be a pious thing to say that Jesus had a mother in Mary; and you hold a similar view on certain other positions which you have now been discussing in terms which I, for my part, altogether shrink from repeating.[fn-39-P3914_1115143:624-nf] Now, sometimes a master of any art happens to be compelled by the ignorance of an opponent both to say and to do things which time would make him decline;[fn-39-P3915_1115621:625-nf] and accordingly, because the necessity is laid upon me, by consideration for the multitude present, I may give a brief answer to those statements which have been made so erroneously by you. Let us suppose, now, your allegation to be that if we understand Jesus to be a man made of Mary after the course of nature, and regard him consequently as having flesh and blood, it will be necessary also to hold that the Holy Spirit was a real dove, and not a spirit. Well, then, how can a real dove enter into a real man, and abide in him? For flesh cannot enter into flesh. Nay rather, it is only when we acknowledge Jesus to be a true man, and also hold him who is there said to be like a dove to be the Holy Spirit, that we shall give the correct account according to reason on both sides. For, according to right reason, it may be said that the Spirit dwells in a man, and descends upon him, and abides in him; and these, indeed, are things which have happened already in all due competence, and the occurrence of which is always possible still, as even you yourself admit, inasmuch as you did aforetime profess to be the Paraclete of God, you flint,[fn-39-P3916_1116868:626-nf] as I may call you, and no man, so often forgetful of the very things which you assert. For you declared that the Spirit whom Jesus promised to send has come upon you; and whence can He come but by descending from Heaven? And if the Spirit descends thus on the man worthy of Him, then verily must we fancy that real doves descended upon you? Then truly should we rather discover in you the thieving dove-merchant,[fn-39-P3917_1117557:627-nf] who lays snares and lines for the birds. For surely you well deserve to be made a jest of with words of ridicule. However, I spare you, lest perchance I appear to offend the auditors by such expressions, and also most especially because it is beside my purpose to throw out against you all that you deserve to hear said about you. But let me return to the proper subject. For I am mindful of that transformation of thine,[fn-39-P3918_1118005:628-nf] in virtue of which you say that God has transformed Himself into the fashion of a man or into that of the sun, by which position you think to prove that our Jesus was made man only in fashion and in appearance; which assertion may God save: any of the faithful from making. Now, for the rest, that opinion of yours would reduce the whole matter to a dream, so far as we are concerned, and to mere figures; and not that only,[fn-39-P3919_1118480:629-nf] but the very name of an advent would be done away: for He might have done what He desired to do, though still seated in heaven, if He is, as you say, a spirit, and not a true man. But it is not thus that \"He humbled Himself, and took the form of a servant; \"[fn-39-P3920_1118899:630-nf] and I say this of Him who was made man of Mary. For what? Might not we, too, have set forth things like those with which you have been dealing, and that, too, all the more easily and the more broadly? But far be it from us to swerve one jot or one tittle from the truth. For He who was born of Mary is the Son, who chose of His own accord to sustain this[fn-39-P3921_1119274:631-nf] mighty conflict,-namely, Jesus. This is the Christ of God, who descended upon him who is of Mary. If, however, you refuse to believe even the voice that was heard from heaven, all that you can bring forward in place of the same is but some rashness of your own; and though you were to declare yourself on that, no one would believe you. For forthwith Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil; and as the devil had no correct knowledge of Him, he said to Him, \"If thou be the Son of God.\"[fn-39-P3922_1119877:632-nf] Besides, he did not understand the reason of this bearing of the Son of God by Mary, who preached the kingdom of heaven, whose was also indeed a great tabernacle,[fn-39-P3923_1120060:633-nf] and one that could not have been prepared by any other:[fn-39-P3924_1120182:634-nf] whence, too, He who was nailed to the cross, on rising again from the dead, was taken up thither where Christ the Son of God reigned; so that when He begins to conduct His judgment, those who have been ignorant of Him shall look on Him whom they pierced.[fn-39-P3925_1120791:635-nf] But in order to secure your credence, I propose this question to you: Why was it, that although His disciples sojourned a whole year with Him, not one of them fell prostrate on his face before Him, as you were saying a little ago, save only in that one hour when His countenance shone like the sun? Was it not by reason of that tabernacle which had been made for Him of Mary? For just as no other had the capacity sufficient for sustaining the burden of the Paraclete except only the disciples and the blessed Paul, so also no other was able to bear the Spirit who descended from heaven, and through whom that voice of the Father gave its testimony in these terms, \"This is my beloved Son,\"[fn-39-P3926_1121503:636-nf] save only He who was born of Mary, and who is above all the saints,-namely, Jesus. But now give us your answer to those matters which I bring forward against you. If you hold that He is than only in mien and form, how could He have been laid hold of and dragged off to judgment by those who were born of man and woman-to wit, the Pharisees-seeing that a spiritual body cannot be grasped by bodies of grosser capacities? But if you, who as yet have made no reply to the arguments brought before you, have now any kind of answer to offer to the word and proposition I have adduced, proceed, I pray you, and fetch me at least a handful or some fair modicum of your sunlight.[fn-39-P3927_1122197:637-nf] But that very sun, indeed, inasmuch as it is possessed of a more subtle body, is capable of covering and enveloping you; while you, on the other hand, can do it no injury, even although you were to trample it under foot. My Lord Jesus, however, if He was laid hold of, was laid hold of as a man by men. If He is not a man, neither was He laid hold of. If He was not laid hold of, neither did He suffer, nor was He baptized. If He was not baptized, neither is any of us baptized. But if there is no baptism, neither will there be any remission of sins, but every man will die in his own sins. Manes said: Is baptism, then, given on account of the remission of sins? Archelaus said: Certainly. Manes said: Does it not follow, then, that Christ has sinned, seeing that He has been baptized? Archelaus said: God forbid! Nay, rather, He was made sin for us, taking on Him our sins.[fn-39-P3928_1123133:638-nf] For this reason He was born of a woman, and for this reason also He approached the rite of baptism, in order that He might receive the purification of this part,[fn-39-P3929_1123316:639-nf] and that thus the body which He had taken to Himself might be capable of bearing the Spirit, who had descended in the form of a dove.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_67_the_protevangelium_of_james","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"ANF-08","text":"1.

If you take counsel on your own responsibility, every man is master of his own mind, and I am innocent of this blood.[fn-55-P5590_1760397:7-nf] I have written thus, not because I distrust you, but that by declaring my own mind I may strengthen some men's hesitation, and prevent any out from being prematurely received into communion, or after receiving the laying on of hands of our enemies, when peace is made, later on, trying to force me to enroll them in the ranks of the sacred ministry. Through you I salute the clergy of the city and diocese, and all the laity who fear the Lord.","title":"Letter CCXL.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_26_letter_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3. We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,[fn-26-P2661_896588:9-nf] nor unlike[fn-26-P2662_896638:10-nf] the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality[fn-26-P2663_897082:11-nf] is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called \"god\" as in the words, \"I have said ye are gods,\"[fn-26-P2664_897294:12-nf] and \"daemon\" as in the words, \"The gods of the nations are daemons,\"[fn-26-P2665_897383:13-nf] in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone is substantially and essentially God. When I say \"alone\" I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and substance of God. For the word \"alone\" is used in the case of any individual and generally of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and \"heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-26-P2666_897874:14-nf] and of human nature, as when David says, \"as for man his days are as grass,\"[fn-26-P2667_897971:15-nf] not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, \"who alone hath immortality\"[fn-26-P2668_898174:16-nf] and \"to God only wise,\"[fn-26-P2669_898218:17-nf] and \"none is good save one, that is God,\"[fn-26-P2670_898279:18-nf] for here \"one\" means the same as alone. So also, \"which alone spreadest out the heavens,\"[fn-26-P2671_898390:19-nf] and again \"Thou shall worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-26-P2672_898486:20-nf] \"There is no God beside me.\"[fn-26-P2673_898690:21-nf] In Scripture \"one\" and \"only\" are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so called.As for instance, \"The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them,\"[fn-26-P2674_898962:22-nf] and \"then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and didserve the Lord only.\"[fn-26-P2675_899086:23-nf] And so St. Paul, \"For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but out god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things.\"[fn-26-P2676_899285:24-nf] Here we enquire why when he had said \"one God\" he was not content, for we have said that \"one\" and \"only\" when applied to God, indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase \"one God.\" without, by the further addition of \"the Father,\" expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifyings the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of \"Jesus Christ,\" and charges His disciples to \"tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ.\"[fn-26-P2677_900209:25-nf] For His purpose was, after the completion of the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2678_900288:26-nf] after His resurrection froth the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words \"That they may know Thee the only true God and JesUs Christ whom thou hast sent,\"[fn-26-P2679_900611:27-nf] and again \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me.\"[fn-26-P2680_900681:28-nf] Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in else direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2681_900878:29-nf] and so by omission falling into impiety.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_26_letter_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"11. If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit specially flora the following point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three creations. The first is the evolution from non-being into being.[fn-27-P2734_922103:72-nf] The second is change from the worse to the better. The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son. There is a bringing into existence of the heavens; and what says David? \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.\"[fn-27-P2735_922884:73-nf] Again, man is created through baptism, for \"if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.\"[fn-27-P2736_923038:74-nf] And why does the Saviour say to the disciples, \"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\"? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the Father and the Son. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.[fn-27-P2737_923451:75-nf] And He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.[fn-27-P2738_923553:76-nf] For what the holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? \"You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.\"[fn-27-P2739_923786:77-nf] Now every temple[fn-27-P2740_923823:78-nf] is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for \"He that built all things is God.\"[fn-27-P2741_924303:79-nf] If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shale worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.[fn-27-P2742_924490:80-nf] Supposing them to object to the word \"God,\" let them learn what this word means. God is called Qeo\\j either because He placed (teqeike/nai) all things or because He beholds (Qea=sqai) all things. If He is called Qeo\\j because He \"placed\" or \"beholds\" all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.[fn-27-P2743_924902:81-nf] Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God,[fn-27-P2744_925167:82-nf] then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For \"the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;\"[fn-27-P2745_925393:83-nf] and \"thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\"[fn-27-P2746_925532:84-nf] But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said \"if I by the finger of God cast out devils,\"[fn-27-P2747_925648:85-nf] of which the version in another Gospel is \"if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.\"[fn-27-P2748_925753:86-nf] So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
