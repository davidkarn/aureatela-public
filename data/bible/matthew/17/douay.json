{"verses":["And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and\nJohn his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:","And he was transfigured before them.  And his face did shine as\nthe sun:  and his garments became white as snow.","And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with\nhim.","And Peter answering, said to Jesus:  Lord, it is good for us to be\nhere:  if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee,\nand one for Moses, and one for Elias.","And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed\nthem.  And lo a voice out of the cloud, saying:  This is my beloved Son,\nin whom I am well pleased:  hear ye him.","And the disciples hearing fell upon their face, and were very\nmuch afraid.","And Jesus came and touched them:  and said to them:  Arise, and\nfear not.","And they lifting up their eyes, saw no one, but only Jesus.","And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,\nsaying:  Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from\nthe dead.","And his disciples asked him, saying:  Why then do the scribes say\nthat Elias must come first?","But he answering, said to them:  Elias indeed shall come, and\nrestore all things.","But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him\nnot, But have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind.  So also the Son\nof man shall suffer from them.","Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of\nJohn the Baptist.","And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man\nfalling down on his knees before him saying:  Lord, have pity on my son,\nfor he is a lunatic, and suffereth much:  for he falleth often into the\nfire, and often into the water.","And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.","Then Jesus answered and said:  O unbelieving and perverse\ngeneration, how long shall I be with you?  How long shall I suffer you?\nBring him hither to me.","And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the\nchild was cured from that hour.","Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said:  Why could\nnot we cast him out?","Jesus said to them:  Because of your unbelief.  For, amen I say to\nyou, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to\nthis mountain:  Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove:  and\nnothing shall be impossible to you.","But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.","And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them:  The\nSon of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:","And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.\nAnd they were troubled exceedingly.","And when they were come to Capharnaum, they that received the\ndidrachmas, came to Peter, and said to him:  Doth not your master pay\nthe didrachma?","He said:  Yes.  And when he was come into the house, Jesus\nprevented him, saying:  What is thy opinion, Simon?  The kings of the\nearth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom, of their own\nchildren, or of strangers?","And he said:  Of strangers.  Jesus said to him:  Then the children\nare free.","But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea, and cast in\na hook:  and that fish which shall first come up, take:  and when thou\nhast opened it's mouth, thou shalt find a stater:  take that, and give\nit to them for me and thee."]}
