What then is one to do? For if you deal too gently with him who needs a severe application of the knife, and do not strike deep into one who requires such treatment, you remove one part of the sore but leave the other: and if on the other hand you make the requisite incision unsparingly, the patient, driven to desperation by his sufferings, will often fling everything away at once, both the remedy and the bandage, and throw himself down headlong, \"breaking the yoke and bursting the band.\"[fn-3-P330_119669:12-nf] I could tell of many who have run into extreme evils because the due penalty of their sins was exacted. For we ought not, in applying punishment, merely to proportion it to the scale of the offence, but rather to keep in view the disposition of the sinner, lest whilst wishing to mend what is torn, you make the rent worse, and in your zealous endeavors to restore what is fallen, you make the ruin greater. For weak and careless characters, addicted for the most part to the pleasures of the world, and having occasion to be proud on account of birth and position, may yet, if gently and gradually brought to repent of their errors, be delivered, partially at least, if not perfectly, from the evils by which they are possessed: but if any one were to inflict the discipline all at once, he would deprive them of this slight chance of amendment. For when once the soul has been forced to put off shame it lapses into a callous condition, and neither yields to kindly words nor bends to threats, nor is susceptible of gratitude, but becomes far worse than that city which the prophet reproached, saying, \"thou hadst the face of a harlot, refusing to be ashamed before all men.\"[fn-3-P331_120866:13-nf] Therefore the pastor has need of much discretion, and of a myriad eyes to observe on every side the habit of the soul. For as many are uplifted to pride, and then sink into despair of their salvation, from inability to endure severe remedies, so are there some, who from paying no penalty equivalent to their sins, fall into negligence, and become far worse, and are impelled to greater sins. It behoves the priest therefore to leave none of these things unexamined, but, after a thorough inquiry into all of them, to apply such remedies as he has appositely to each case, lest his zeal prove to be in vain. And not in this matter only, but also in the work of knitting together the severed members of the Church, one can see that he has much to do. For the pastor of sheep has his flock following him, wherever he may lead them: and if any should stray out of the straight path, and, deserting the good pasture, feed in unproductive or rugged places, a loud shout suffices to collect them and bring back to the fold those who have been parted from it: but if a human being wanders away from the right faith, great exertion, perseverance and patience are required; for he cannot be dragged back by force, nor constrained by fear, but must be led back by persuasion to the truth from which be originally swerved. The pastor therefore ought to be of a noble spirit, so as not to despond, or to despair of the salvation of wanderers from the fold, but continually to reason with himself and say, \"Peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil.\"[fn-3-P332_122529:14-nf] Therefore the Lord, when addressing His disciples, said, \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant?\"[fn-3-P333_122654:15-nf] For he indeed who disciplines himself compasses only his own advantage, but the benefit of the pastoral function extends to the whole people. And one who dispenses money to the needy, or otherwise succors the oppressed, benefits his neighbors to some extent, but so much less than the priest in proportion as the body is inferior to the soul. Rightly therefore did the Lord say that zeal for the flock was a token of love for Himself.","title":"Book II.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":24,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"20.

For here also the expression \"Thy kingdom come\" is not used in such a way as if God were not now reigning. But some one perhaps might say the expression \"come\" meant upon earth; as if, indeed, He were not even now really reigning upon earth, and had not always reigned upon it from the foundation of the world. \"Come,\" therefore, is to be understood in the sense of \"manifested to men.\" For in the same way also as a light which is present is absent to the blind, and to those who shut their eyes; so the kingdom of God, though it never departs from the earth, is yet absent to those who are ignorant of it. But no one will be allowed to be ignorant of the kingdom of God, when His Only-begotten shall come from heaven, not only in a way to be apprehended by the understanding, but also visibly in the person of the Divine Man, in order to judge the quick and the dead. And after that; judgment, i.e. when the process of distinguishing and separating the righteous from the unrighteous has taken place, God will so dwell in the righteous, that there will be no need for any one being taught by man, but all will be, as it is written, \"taught of God.\"[fn-6-P660_247914:42-nf] Then will the blessed life in all its parts be perfected in the saints unto eternity, just as now the most holy and blessed heavenly angels are wise and blessed, from the fact that God alone is their light; because the Lord hath promised this also to His own: \"In the resurrection,\" says He, \"they will be as the angels in heaven.\"[fn-6-P661_248278:43-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"44.

One need not wonder indeed at their blasphemous assertion that the Son does not perfectly know the Father; for having once determined to fight against Christ, they reject even the words of the Lord himself, when he says,[fn-2-P228_60139:27-nf] `As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father' If therefore the Father but partially knows the Son, it is manifest that the Son also knows the Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it be admitted that the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is evident that as the Father knows his own Word, so also does the Word know his own Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and unfolding the divine Scriptures, have often confuted them: but again as chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that which is written, `When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity, he becomes contemptuous.'[fn-2-P229_60817:28-nf] Many heresies have arisen before these, which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete infatuation: but these persons, by attempting in all their discourses to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as hating made a nearer approach to Antichrist, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones. Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the Church, and anathematized. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of these persons, and especially so because, after having been previously instructed in the doctrines of the Church, they have now apostatized from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-2-P230_61534:29-nf] fell in like manner; and before them Judas, who had been a follower of the Saviour, but afterwards deserted him became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these very persons: for the Lord himself said: `Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall many deceive many';[fn-2-P231_61911:30-nf] and `the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore after them.'[fn-2-P232_61990:31-nf] And Paul, having learned these things from the Saviour, wrote, `That in the latter times some should apostatize from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'[fn-2-P233_62196:32-nf] who pervert the truth. Seeing then that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard their impiety have in consequence anathematized them, as we before said, and declared them to be alienated from the Catholic Church and faith. Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most honored fellow-ministers, in order the ye might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither does it become us even `to saute such men,'[fn-2-P234_63088:33-nf] as the blessed John has prohibited, `lest we should at any time be made partakers of their sins.'

Is it not plainly this? that each foresees the danger which would attend his incompetence? Well, where the loss is concerned with trifles shall we use so much forethought, and refuse to yield to the pressure of compulsion, but where the punishment is eternal, as it is for those who know not how to handle the Priesthood, shall we want only and inconsiderately run into so great danger, and then advance, as our excuse, the pressing entreaties of others? But He who one day will judge us will entertain no such plea as this. For we ought to show far more caution in spiritual matters than in carnal. But now we are not found exhibiting as much caution. For tell me: if supposing a man to be an artificer, when he is not so, we invited him to do a piece of work, and he were to respond to the call, and then having set his hand to the material prepared for the building, were to spoil the wood and spoil the stone, and so to build the house that it straightway fell to pieces, would it be sufficient excuse for him to allege that he had been urged by others and did not come of his own accord? in no wise; and very reasonably and justly so. For he ought to have refused even at the call of others. So for the man who only spoils wood and stone, there will be no escape from paying the penalty, and is he who destroys souls, and builds the temple of God carelessly, to think that the compulsion of others is his warrant for escaping punishment? Is not this very absurd? For I omit the fact as yet that no one is able to compel the man who is unwilling. But be it that he was subjected to excessive pressure and divers artful devices, and then fell into a snare; will this therefore rescue him from punishment? I beseech thee, let us not deceive ourselves, and pretend that we know not what is obvious to a mere child. For surely this pretence of ignorance will not be able to profit in the day of reckoning. Thou wert not ambitious, thou sayest, of receiving this high office, conscious of thine own weakness. Well and good. Then thou oughtest, with the same mind, to have declined the solicitation of others; or, when no one called thee, wast thou weak and incapable, but when those were found ready to offer thee this dignity, didst thou suddenly become competent? What ludicrous nonsense! worthy of the extremest punishment. For this reason also the Lord counsels the man who wishes to build a tower, not to lay the foundation before he has taken his own ability to build into account, lest he should give the passers by innumerable opportunities of mocking at him.[fn-4-P463_231666:19-nf] But in his case the penalty only consists in becoming a laughing-stock; while in that before us the punishment is that of fire unquenchable, and of an undying worm,[fn-4-P464_231858:20-nf] gnashing of teeth, outer darkness, and being cut asunder,[fn-4-P465_231935:21-nf] and having a portion with the hypocrites.","title":"Book IV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":24,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"2 His words are as follows:[fn-16-P1656_776527:82-nf] \"Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!

Moreover by any one who carefully uses his reason it will be found that even at the moment of the expected appearance of the Lord from heaven the Holy Spirit will not, as some suppose, have no functions to discharge: on the contrary, even in the day of His revelation, in which the blessed and only potentate[fn-15-P1593_394396:359-nf] will judge the world in righteousness,[fn-15-P1594_394458:360-nf] the Holy Spirit will be present with Him. For who is so ignorant of the good things prepared by God for them that are worthy. as not to know that the crown of the righteous is the grace of the Spirit, bestowed in more abundant and perfect measure in that day, when spiritual glory shall be distributed to each in proportion as he shall have nobly played the man? For among the glories of the saints are \"many mansions\" in the Father's house,[fn-15-P1595_394927:361-nf] that is differences of dignities: for as \"star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1596_395068:362-nf] They, then, that were sealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,[fn-15-P1597_395161:363-nf] and preserve pure anti undiminished the first fruits which they received of the Spirit, are they that shall hear the words\"well done thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.\"[fn-15-P1598_395540:364-nf] In like manner they which have grieved the Holy Spirit by the wickedness of their ways, or have not wrought for Him that gave to them, shall be deprived of what they have received, their grace being transferred to others; or, according to one of the evangelists, they shall even be wholly cut asunder,[fn-15-P1599_395868:365-nf] -the cutting asunder meaning complete separation from the Spirit. The body is not divided, part being delivered to chastisement, and part let off; for when a whole has sinned it were like the old fables, and unworthy of a righteous judge, for only the half to suffer chastisement. Nor is the soul cut in two,-that soul the whole of which possesses the sinful affection throughout, and works the wickedness in co-operation with the body. The cutting asunder, as I have observed, is the separation for aye of the soul from the Spirit. For now, although the Spirit does not suffer admixture with the unworthy, He nevertheless does seem in a manner to be present with them that have once been sealed, awaiting the salvation which follows on their conversion; but then He will be wholly cut off from the soul that has defiled His grace. For this reason \"In Hell there is none that maketh confession; in death none that remembereth God,\"[fn-16-P1600_396824:366-nf] because the succour of the Spirit is no longer present. How then is it possible to conceive that the judgment is accomplished without the Holy Spirit, wherein the word points out that He is Himself the prize[fn-16-P1601_397054:367-nf] of the righteous, when instead of the earnest[fn-16-P1602_397124:368-nf] is given that which is perfect, and the first condemnation of sinners, when they are deprived of that which they seem to have? But the greatest proof of the conjunction of the Spirit with the Father and the Son is that He is said to have the same relation to God which the spirit in us has to each of us. \"For what man\" it is said, \"knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.\"[fn-16-P1603_397764:369-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":24,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"196","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"79.

I was taught too by the children at Babylon,[fn-19-P1968_543515:651-nf] that, when there is no one to sopport the cause of true religion, we ought alone and all unaided to do our duty. They from out of the midst of the flame lifted up their voices in hymns and praise to God, reeking not of the host that set the truth at naught, but sufficient, three only that they were, with one another. Wherefore we too are undismayed at the cloud of our enemies, and, resting our hope on the aid of the Spirit, have, with all boldness, proclaimed the truth.

Such are their proceedings: and yet instead of blushing at their former clumsy intrigues against us, they even now abuse us for having effected our escape out of their murderous hands; nay, are grievously vexed that they were unable to put us out of the way altogether. In short, they overlook the fact that while they pretend to upbraid us with `cowardice,' they are really criminating themselves: for if it be disgraceful to flee, it is still more so to pursue, since the one is only endeavoring to avoid being murdered, while the other is seeking to commit the deed. But Scripture itself directs us to flee:[fn-10-P1062_473279:27-nf] and those who persecute unto death, in attempting to violate the law, constrain us to have recourse to flight. They should rather, therefore, be ashamed of their persecution, than reproach us for having sought to escape from it: let them cease to harass, and those who flee will also cease. Nevertheless they set no bounds to their malevolence, using every art to entrap us, in the consciousness that the flight of the persecuted is the strongest condemnation of the persecutor: for no one runs away from a mild and beneficent person, but from one who is of a barbarous and cruel disposition. Hence it was that `Every one that was discontented and in debt' fled from Saul to David.[fn-10-P1063_473979:28-nf] Wherefore these [foes of ours] in like manner desire to kill such as conceal themselves, that no evidence may exist to convict them of their wickedness. But in this also these misguided men most egregiously deceive themselves: for the more obvious the effort to elude them, the more manifestly will their deliberate slaughters and exiles be exposed. If they act the part of assassins, the voice of the blood which is shed will cry against them the louder: and if they condemn to banishment, they will raise so everywhere living monuments-of their own injustice and oppression. Surely unless their intellects were unsound they would perceive the dilemma in which their own counsels entangle them. But since they have lost sound judgment, their folly is exposed when they vanish, and when they seek to stay they do not see their wickedness.[fn-10-P1064_474846:29-nf] But if they reproach those who succeed in secreting themselves from the malice of their blood-thirsty adversaries, and revile such as flee from their persecutors, what will they say to Jacob's retreat from the rage of his brother Esau,[fn-10-P1065_475109:30-nf] and to Moses[fn-10-P1066_475140:31-nf] retiring into the land of Midian for fear of Pharaoh? And what apology will these babblers make for David's[fn-10-P1067_475265:32-nf] flight from Saul, when he sent messengers from his own house to dispatch him; and for his concealment in a cave, after contriving to extricate himself from the treacherous designs of Abimelech,[fn-10-P1068_475480:33-nf] by feigning madness? What will these reckless asserters of whatever suits their purpose answer, when they are reminded of the great prophet Elijah,[fn-10-P1069_475679:34-nf] who by calling upon God had recalled the dead to life, hiding himself from dread of Ahab, and fleeing on account of Jezebel's menaces? At which time the sons of the prophets also, being sought for in order to be slain, withdrew, and were concealed in caves by Obadiah;[fn-10-P1070_475969:35-nf] or are they unacquainted with these instances because of their antiquity? Have they forgotten also what is recorded in the Gospel, that the disciples retreated and hid themselves for fear of the Jews?[fn-10-P1071_476193:36-nf] Paul,[fn-10-P1072_476220:37-nf] when sought for by the governor [of Damascus] `was let down from the wall in a basket, and thus escaped the hands of him that sought him.' Since then Scripture relates these circumstances concerning the saints, what excuse can they fabricate for their temerity? If they charge us with `cowardice,' it is in utter insensibility to the condemnation it pronounces on themselves. If they asperse these holy men by asserting that they acted contrary to the will of God, they demonstrate their ignorance of Scripture. For it was commanded in the Law that `cities of refuge' should be constituted,[fn-10-P1073_476846:38-nf] by which provision was made that such as were pursued in order to be put to death might have means afforded of preserving themselves. Again in the consummation of the ages, when the Word of the Father, who had before spoken by Moses, came himself to the earth, he gave this express injunction, `When they persecute you in one city, flee unto another:'[fn-10-P1074_477219:39-nf] and shortly after, `When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (let whosoever reads, understand), then let those in Judea flee unto the mountains: let him that is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house; nor him that is in the fields return to take his clothes.'[fn-10-P1075_477598:40-nf] The saints therefore knowing these precepts, had such a sort of training for their action: for what the Lord then commanded, he had before his coming in the flesh already spoken of by his servants. And this is a universal rule for man, leading to perfection, `to practice whatever God has enjoined.' On this account the Word himself, becoming incarnate for our sake, deigned to conceal himself when he was sought for;[fn-10-P1076_478040:41-nf] and being again persecuted, condescended to withdraw to avoid the conspiracy against him. For thus it became him, by hungering and thirsting and suffering other afflictions, to demonstrate that he was indeed made man.[fn-10-P1077_478278:42-nf] For at the very commencement, as soon as he was born, he gave this direction by an angel to Joseph: `Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, for Herod will seek the infant's life.'[fn-10-P1078_478521:43-nf] And after Herod's death, it appears that for fear of his son Archelaus he retired to Nazareth. Subsequently; when he gave unquestionable evidence of his Divine character by healing the withered hand, `when the Pharisees took council how they might destroy him,[fn-10-P1079_478815:44-nf] Jesus knowing their wickedness withdrew himself thence.' Moreover, when he had raised Lazarus from the dead, and they had become still more intent on destroying him, [we are told that] `Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews,[fn-10-P1080_479080:45-nf] but retired into a region on the borders of the desert.' Again when the Saviour said, `Before Abraham was, I am;'[fn-10-P1081_479225:46-nf] and the Jews took up stones to cast at him; Jesus concealed himself, and going through the midst of them out of the Temple, went away thence, and so escaped. Since then they see these things, or rather understand them,[fn-10-P1082_479464:47-nf] (for they will not see,) are they not deserving of being burnt with fire, according to what is written, for acting and speaking so plainly contrary to all that the Lord did and taught? Finally, when John had suffered martyrdom, and his disciples had buried his body, Jesus having heard what was done, departed thence by ship into a desert place apart.[fn-10-P1083_479849:48-nf] Now the Lord did these things and so taught. But would that these men of whom I speak, had the modesty to confine their rashness to men only, without daring to be guilty of such madness as to accuse the Saviour himself of `cowardice'; especially after having already uttered blasphemies against him. But even if they be insane they will not be tolerated and their ignorance of the gospels be detected by every one. The cause for retreat and flight under such circumstances as these is reasonable and valid, of which the evangelists have afforded us precedents in the conduct of our Saviour himself: from which it may be inferred that the saints have always been justly influenced by the same principle, since whatever is recorded of him as man, is applicable to mankind in general. For he took on himself our nature, and exhibited in himself the affections of our infirmity, which John has thus indicated: `Then they sought to take him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.'[fn-10-P1084_480887:49-nf] Moreover, before that hour came, he himself said to his mother, `Mine hour is not yet come;'[fn-10-P1085_480999:50-nf] and to those who were denominated his brethren, `My time is not yet come.' Again when the time had arrived, he said to his disciples, `Sleep on now, and take your rest: for behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.'[fn-10-P1086_481295:51-nf] ... So[fn-10-P1087_481321:52-nf] that he neither permitted himself to be apprehended before the time came; nor when the time was come did he conceal himself, but voluntarily gave himself up to those who had conspired against him.[fn-10-P1088_481543:53-nf] ...Thus also the blessed martyrs have guarded themselves in times of persecution: being persecuted they fled, and kept themselves concealed; but being discovered they suffered martyrdom.","title":"Book III.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":24,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"The emperor in another attempt to molest the Christians exposed his superstition. Being fond of sacrificing, he not only himself delighted in the blood of victims, but considered it an indignity offered to him, if others did not do likewise. And as he found but few persons of this stamp, he sent for the Jews and enquired of them why they abstained from sacrificing, since the law of Moses enjoined it? On their replying that it was not permitted them to do this in any other place than Jerusalem, he immediately ordered them to rebuild Solomon's temple. Meanwhile he himself proceeded on his expedition against the Persians. The Jews who had been long desirous of obtaining a favorable opportunity for rearing their temple afresh in order that they might therein offer sacrifice, applied themselves very vigorously to the work. Moreover, they conducted themselves with great insolence toward the Christians, and threatened to do them as much mischief, as they had themselves suffered from the Romans.

Being fond of sacrificing, he not only himself delighted in the blood of victims, but considered it an indignity offered to him, if others did not do likewise. And as he found but few persons of this stamp, he sent for the Jews and enquired of them why they abstained from sacrificing, since the law of Moses enjoined it? On their replying that it was not permitted them to do this in any other place than Jerusalem, he immediately ordered them to rebuild Solomon's temple. Meanwhile he himself proceeded on his expedition against the Persians. The Jews who had been long desirous of obtaining a favorable opportunity for rearing their temple afresh in order that they might therein offer sacrifice, applied themselves very vigorously to the work. Moreover, they conducted themselves with great insolence toward the Christians, and threatened to do them as much mischief, as they had themselves suffered from the Romans.

I do not deny that holy women are found both among widows and those who have husbands; but they are such as have ceased to be wives, or such as, even in the close bond of marriage, imitate virgin chastity. The Apostle, Christ speaking in him, briefly bore witness to this when he said,[fn-61-P6108_1828840:84-nf] \"She that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how she may please the Lord: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.\" He leaves us the free exercise of our reason in the matter. He lays no necessity upon anyone nor leads anyone into a snare: he only persuades to that which is proper when he wishes all men to be as himself. He had not, it is true, a commandment from the Lord respecting virginity, for that grace surpasses the unassisted power of man, and it would have worn an air of immodesty to force men to fly in the face of nature, and to say in other words, I want you to be what the angels are. It is this angelic purity which secures to virginity its highest reward, and the Apostle might have seemed to despise a course of life which involves no guilt. Nevertheless in the immediate context he adds,[fn-61-P6109_1829742:85-nf] \"But I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is.\" What is meant by present distress?[fn-61-P6110_1830005:86-nf] \"Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!\" The reason why the wood grows up is that it may be cut down. The field is sown that it may be reaped. The world is already full, and the population is too large for the soil. Every day we are being cut down by war, snatched away by disease, swallowed up by shipwreck, although we go to law with one another about the fences of our property. It is only one addition to the general rule which is made by those who follow the Lamb, and who have not defiled their garments, for they have continued in their virgin state. Notice the meaning of defiling. I shall not venture to explain it, for fear Helvidius may be abusive. I agree with you, when you say, that some virgins are nothing but tavern women; I say still more, thateven adulteresses may be found among them, and, you will no doubt be still more surprised to hear, that some of the clergy are inn-keepers and some monks unchaste. Who does not at once understand that a tavern woman cannot be a virgin, nor an adulterer a monk, nor a clergy-man a tavern-keeper? Are we to blame virginity if its counterfeit is at fault? For my part, to pass over other persons and come to the virgin, I maintain that she who is engaged in huckstering, though for anything I know she may be a virgin in body, is no longer one in spirit.","title":"The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary","author":false},{"chapter":24,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-04","text":"What harshness, therefore, is here on our part, if we renounce (communion with) such as do not the will of God?

Do you talk of salvation for them after the Cross? Bear with me a little. Great is the mercy of God. And this very fact does, no less than the resurrection, prove him to be God, yea, no less than His miracles-the fact that He calls these to Him. For surpassing goodness is, above all things, peculiarly God's own. Therefore also He says, \"None is good save one, that is, God.\" (Luke xviii. 19.) Only let us not take this goodness for an occasion of negligence. For He also punishes as God. In fact, the very punishments here spoken of, He brought them to pass, even He who said, \"Every one who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.\" I speak of the fate of Jerusalem;[fn-3-P390_219411:15-nf] that intolerable punishment: of which I will tell you some few of the particulars, useful to us in our contest, both with the Marcionites and many other heretics. For, since they distinguish between Christ a good God, and that evil God [of the Old Testament], let us see who it was that effected these things. The evil God, taking vengeance for Christ? or not so? How then alien to Him? But was it the good God? Nay, but it is demonstrated that both the Father and the Son did these things. The Father in many places; for instance, when He says in the parable of the vineyard,[fn-3-P391_220848:16-nf] [\"He will miserably destroy those wicked husbandmen\" (Matt. xxi. 41); again in the parable of the marriage feast, the King is said] to send His armies (ib.xxii. 7): and the Son, when He says, \"But those Mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before Me.\" (Luke xix. 27.) * * *[fn-3-P392_221356:17-nf] And they sent, saying, We will not have Thee to reign over us. Would you like then to hear the things which actually came to pass? Moreover, Christ Himself also speaks of the future tribulations, than which never any thing more dreadful came to pass; never any thing more ruthless, my beloved, than the deeds then done![fn-3-P393_221858:18-nf] And He Himself declared it. For what could you wish to see more grievous than these? * * *-probed them with their daggers![fn-3-P394_222345:19-nf] - * * * But shall I relate to you the shocking case of the woman, that tragic tale? * * * (Joseph. B. J. vi. 3. 4.) Did not the actual events cast all misery into the shade? But shall I tell you of famines and pestilences? One might speak of horrors without number: nature was unknown; law unknown; they outdid wild beasts in ferocity. True, these miseries came by the fate of wars; but because God, because Christ so willed it to be. These facts will apply both against the Marcionites and against those who do not believe that there is a hell: for they are sufficient to silence their impudence. Are not these calamities more severe than the Babylonian?[fn-3-P395_224367:20-nf] Are not these sufferings more grievous than the famines of that time? Yes, for [\"never was the like from the beginning of the world\"] \"no, nor ever shall be such.\" (Matt. xxiv. 21.) And this was Christ's own declaration. In what sense then, think ye, is it said that Christ remitted them their sin?[fn-3-P396_225038:21-nf] Perhaps it seems a commonplace question: but do ye solve it.-It is not possible to show anywhere, even in fiction, any thing like what the reality was here. And had it been a Christian that wrote this history, the matter might be regarded with suspicion: but if he was a Jew, and a Jewish zealot, and after the Gospel, how can the meaning of the facts be otherwise than palpable to all men? For you will see the man, how, everywhere, he always extols the concerns of the Jews.-There is therefore a hell, O man! and God is good.-Aye, did you shudder at hearing these horrors?But these, which take place here, are nothing in comparison with what shall be in that world. Once more I am compelled to seem harsh, disagreeable, stern. But what can I do? I am set to this: just as a severe schoolmaster is set to be hated by his scholars: so are we. For would it not be strange indeed, that, while those who have a certain post assigned them by kings do that which is appointed them, however disagreeable the task may be, we, for fear of your censure, should leave our appointed task undone? Another has a different work. Of you, many have it for their work, to show mercy, to act humanely, to be pleasant and agreeable to the persons to whom you are benefactors. But to those to whom we do good, we seem stern and severe, troublesome and disagreeable. For we do good, not by the pleasure we give, but by the pain we inflict. So it is also with the physician: though he indeed is not excessively disagreeable, for the benefit afforded by his art is had immediately; ours hereafter. So again the magistrate is odious to the disorderly and seditious; so the legislator is vexatious to them for whom he makes laws. But not so he that invites to enjoyment, not so he that prepares public festivities and entertainments, and puts all the people in garlands: no, these are men that win acceptance, feasting, as they do, whole cities with all sorts of spectacles; contributing largely, bearing all the cost. And therefore those whom they have treated, requite them for these enjoyments with words of welcome and benediction, with hanging (parapetasmata) of tapestries, and a blaze of lamps, and with wreaths, and boughs, and brilliant garments. Whereas, at the sight of the physician, the sick become sad and downcast: at sight of the magistrate, the rioters become subdued: no running riot then, no gambolling, except when he also goes over into their ranks.[fn-3-P397_228111:22-nf] Let us see, then, which render the best service to their cities; those who provide these festivities, and banquetings, and expensive entertainments, and manifold rejoicings; or those who restrain all those doings, bearing before them stocks, scourges, executioners, dreaded soldiers, and a voice fraught with much terror: and issuing orders, and making men hang down their heads, and with the rod dispersing the idlers in the market-place. Let us see, I say; these are the disagreeable, those the beloved: let us see where the gain rests. (lhlei.) What comes then of your pleasure-givers? A kind of frigid enjoyment, lasting till the evening, and to-morrow vanished; mirth ungoverned, words unseemly and dissolute. And what of these? Awe, sobriety, subdued thoughts; reasonableness of mind, an end of idleness; a curb on the passions within; a wall of defence, next to God,[fn-3-P398_229566:23-nf] against assailants from without. It is by means of these we have each our property but by those ruinous festivities we dissipate it. Robbers indeed have not invaded it, but vainglory together with pleasure acts the part of robber. Each sees the robber carrying off everything before his eyes, and is delighted at it! A new fashion of robbery, this, to induce people to be glad when one is plundering them! On the other part, there is nothing of the kind: but God, as the common Father, has secured us as by a wall against all [depredators], both seen and unseen.[fn-3-P399_230177:24-nf] For, \"Take heed,\" saith He, \"that ye do not your alms before men.\" (Matt. vi. 1.) The soul learns from the one, [excess;[fn-4-P400_231135:25-nf] from the other] to flee injustice. For injustice consists not merely in grasping at more wealth than belongs to us, but in giving to the belly more than its needful sustenance, in carrying mirth beyond its proper bounds, and causing it to run into frantic excesses. From the one, it learns sobriety; from the other, unchastity. For it is unchastity, not merely to have carnal intercourse with women, but even to look upon a woman with unchaste eyes. From the one, it learns modesty; from the other, conceited self-importance. For, \"All things,\" says the Apostle, \"are lawful for me, but not all things expedient.\" (1 Cor. vi. 12.) From the one, decent behavior; from the other unseemliness. For, as to the doings in the theatres, I pass these. But to let you see that it is not even a pleasure either, but a grief, show me, but a single day after the festival, both those who spent their money in giving it, and those who were feasted with spectacles: and you shall see them all looking dejected enough, but most of all him, your (ekeinon) famous man that has spent his money for it. And this is but fair: for, the day before, he delighted the common man, and the common man indeed was in high good humor and enjoyment, and rejoiced indeed in the splendid garment, but then not having the use of it, and seeing himself stripped of it, he was grieved and annoyed; and wanted to be the great man, seeing even his own enjoyment to be small compared with his.[fn-4-P401_232876:26-nf] Therefore, the day after, they change places, and now he, the great man, gets the larger share in the dejection.","title":"Homily V.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":24,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_09_lecture_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2.

The majority it is true of those who are not very sensibly minded propose to be content with escaping hell; but I say that a far more severe punishment than hell is exclusion from the glory of the other world, and I think that one who has failed to reach it ought not to sorrow so much over the miseries of hell, as over his rejection from heaven, for this alone is more dreadful than all other things in respect of punishment. But frequently now when we see a king, attended by a large bodyguard, enter the palace, we count those happy who are near him, and have a share in his speech and mind, and partake of all the rest of his glory; and even if we have countless blessings, we have no perception of any of them, and deem ourselves miserable when we look at the glory of those who are round about him, although we know that such splendour is slippery and insecure, both on account of wars, and plots, and envy, and because apart from these things it is not in itself worthy of any consideration. But where the king of all is concerned, he who holds not a portion of the earth but the whole circuit of it, or rather who comprehends it all in the hollow of his hand, and measures the Heavens with a span, who upholdeth all things by the word of His power,[fn-6-P653_380206:36-nf] by whom all the nations are counted as nought, and as a drop of spittle;-in the case of such a king I say shall we no reckon it the most extreme punishment to miss being enrolled in that company which is round about him, but be content if we merely escape hell? and what could be more pitiable than this condition of soul? For this king does not come to judge the earth, drawn by a pair of white mules, nor tiding in a golden chariot, nor arrayed in a purple robe and diadem. How then does He come? Hear the prophets crying aloud and saying as much as it is possible to tell to men: for one saith \"God shall come openly, even our God and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be round about Him: He shall call the Heaven from above and the earth that He may judge His people.\"[fn-6-P654_381126:37-nf] But Esias depicts the actual punishment impending over us speaking thus: \"Behold the day of the Lord cometh, inexorable, with wrath and anger; to lay the whole world desolate, and to destroy sinners out of it. For the stars of Heaven, and Orion, and the whole system of the heaven shall not give their light, and the sun shall be darkened in its going down,[fn-6-P655_381501:38-nf] and the moon shall not give her light; and I will ordain evils against the whole world, and visit their sins upon the ungodly, and I will destroy the insolence of the lawless, and humble the insolence of the proud, and they who are left shall be more precious than unsmelted gold, and a man shall be more precious than the sapphire stone. For the heaven shall be disturbed[fn-6-P656_381920:39-nf] and the earth shall be shaken from its foundations by reason of the fury of the wrath of the Lord of Sabaoth, in the day when His wrath shall come upon us.\"[fn-6-P657_382133:40-nf] And again \"windows\" he saith \"hall be opened from the Heaven, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken the earth shall be mightily confounded, the earth shall be bent low, it shall be perplexed with great perplexity, the earth shall stagger grievously like the drunkard and the reveller; the earth shall shake as a hut, it shall fall and not be able to rise up again: for iniquity has waxed mighty therein. And God shall set His hand upon the host of the Heaven in the height in that day, and upon the kingdoms of the earth, and He shall gather together the congregation thereof into a prison, and shall shut them up in a stronghold.\"[fn-6-P658_382800:41-nf] And Malachi speaking concordantly with these said \"Behold the Lord almighty cometh, and who shall abide the day of His coming or who shall stand when He appeareth for He cometh like a refiner's fire, and like fullers soap: and He shall sit refining and purifying as it were silver, and as it were gold.\"[fn-6-P659_383165:42-nf] And again, \"Behold,\" he saith, \"the day of the Lord cometh, burning like an oven, and it shall consume them, and all the aliens, and all who work iniquity shall be stubble, and the day which is coming shall set fire to them saith the Lord almighty; and there shall be left neither root nor branch.\"[fn-6-P660_383487:43-nf] And the man greatly beloved saith \"I beheld until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated, and his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head was pure as wool: His throne was a flame of fire, and the wheels thereof burning fire: a stream of fire wound its way in front of Him. Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The judgment was set and the books were opened.\"[fn-6-P661_383950:44-nf] Then after a little space \"I beheld,\" he says, \"in a vision of the night and behold\" with the clouds of Heaven, one came like the Son of Man, and reached unto the Ancient of Days, and was brought near before Him, and to Him was given rule, and honor, and the kingdom, and all the people, tribes and tongues serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. As for me Daniel, my spirit shuddered within me, and the visions of my head troubled me.\"[fn-6-P662_384587:45-nf] Then all the gates of the heavenly vaults are opened, or rather the heaven itself is taken away out of the midst \"for the heaven,\" we read \"shall be rolled up like a scroll,\"[fn-6-P663_384832:46-nf] wrapped up in the middle like the skin and covering of some tent so as to be transformed into some better shape. Then all things are full of amazement and horror and trembling: then even the angels themselves are holden by much fear, and not angels only but also archangels and thrones, and dominions, and principalities and authorities. \"For the powers\" we read \"of the heavens shall be shaken,\" because their fellow-servants are required to give an account of their life in this world.[fn-6-P664_385342:47-nf] For if when a single city is bring judged before rulers in this world, all men shudder, even those who are outside the danger, when the whole world is arraigned before such a judge as this who needs no witnesses, or proofs, but independently of all these things brings forward deeds and words and thoughts, and exhibits them all as in some picture both to those who have committed the sins and to those who are ignorant of them, how is it not natural that every power should be confounded and shake? For if there were no river of fire winding by, nor any terrible angels standing by the side of the throne, but men were merely summoned some to be praised and admired, others to be dismissed with ignominy that they might not see the glory of God, (\"For let the ungodly\" we read \"be taken away that he may not see the glory of the Lord\"[fn-6-P665_386200:48-nf] ) and if this were the only punishment would not the loss of such blessings sting the souls of those who were deprived of them more bitterly than all hell itself? For how great an evil this is cannot possibly be represented now in words; but then we shall know it clearly in the actual reality. But now I pray add the punishment also to the scene, and imagine men not only covered with shame, and veiling their heads, and bending them low, but also being dragged along the road to the fire, and haled away to the instruments of torture and delivered over to the cruel powers, and suffering these things just at the time when all they who have practised what is good, and wrought deeds worthy of eternal life, are being crowned, and proclaimed conquerors, and presented before the royal throne.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":24,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_15_book_ix_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"14.

But in the love of carnal and temporal things, as in the offspring of animals, the conception of the word is one thing, the bringing forth another. For here what is conceived by desiring is born by attaining. Since it does; not suffice to avarice to know and to love gold, except it also have it; nor to know and love to eat, or to lie with any one, unless also one does it; nor to know and love honors and power, unless they actually come to pass.

Do not then imagine, O man!that the visible world is without a beginning; and because the celestial bodies move in a circular course, and it is difficult for our senses to define the point where the circle begins, do not believe that bodies impelled by a circular movement are, from their nature, without a beginning. Without doubt the circle (I mean the plane figure described by a single line) is beyond our perception, and it is impossible for us to find out where it begins or where it ends; but we ought not on this account to believe it to be without a beginning. Although we are not sensible of it, it really begins at some point where the draughtsman has begun to draw it at a certain radius from the centre.[fn-19-P1999_554186:9-nf] Thus seeing that figures which move in a circle always return upon themselves, without for a single instant interrupting the regularity of their course, do not vainly imagine to yourselves that the world has neither beginning nor end. \"For the fashion of this world passeth away\"[fn-20-P2000_554681:10-nf] and \"Heaven and earth shall pass away.\"[fn-20-P2001_554742:11-nf] The dogmas of the end, and of the renewing of the world, are announced beforehand in these short words put at the head of the inspired history. \"In the beginning God made.\" That which was begun in time is condemned to come to an end in time.

I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is,\" Here our opponent goes utterly wild with exultation: this is his strongest battering-ram with which he shakes the wall of virginity. \"See,\" says he, \"the Apostle confesses that as regards virgins he has no commandment of the Lord, and he who had with authority laid down the law respecting husbands and wives, does not dare to command what the Lord has not enjoined. And rightly too. For what is enjoined is commanded, what is commanded must be done, and that which must be done implies punishment if it be not done. For it is useless to order a thing to be done and yet leave the individual free to do it or not do it. If the Lord had commanded virginity He would have seemed to condemn marriage, and to do away with the seed-plot of mankind, of which virginity itself is a growth. If He had cut off the root, how was He to expect fruit? If the foundations were not first laid, how was He to build the edifice, and put on the roof to cover all! Excavators toil hard to remove mountains; the bowels of the earth are pierced in the search for gold. And, when the tiny particles, first by the blast of the furnace, then by the hand of the cunning workman have been fashioned into an ornament, men do not call him blessed who has separated the gold from the dross, but him who wears the beautiful gold. Do not marvel then if, placed as we are, amid temptations of the flesh and incentives to vice, the angelic life be not exacted of us, but merely recommended. If advice be given, a man is free to proffer obedience; if there be a command, he is a servant bound to compliance. \"I have no commandment,\" he says, \"of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.\" If you have no commandment of the Lord, how dare you give judgement without orders? The Apostle will reply: Do you wish me to give orders where the Lord has offered a favour rather than laid down a law? The great Creator and Fashioner, knowing the weakness of the vessel which he made, left virginity open to those whom He addressed; and shall I, the teacher of the Gentiles, who have become all things to all men that I might gain all, shall I lay upon the necks of weak believers from the very first the burden of perpetual chastity? Let them[fn-62-P6208_1883228:63-nf] begin with short periods of release from the marriage bond, and give themselves unto prayer, that when they have tasted the sweets of chastity they may desire the perpetual possession of that wherewith they were temporarily delighted. The Lord, when tempted by the Pharisees, and asked whether according to the law of Moses it was permitted to put away a wife, forbade the practice altogether. After weighing His words the disciples said to Him:[fn-62-P6209_1883732:64-nf] \"If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. But He said unto them, all men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, which were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, which made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" The reason is plain why the Apostle said, \"concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord.\" Surely; because the Lord had previously said \"All men cannot receive the word, but they to whom it is given,\" and \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\"[fn-62-P6210_1884446:65-nf] The Master of the Christian race offers the reward, invites candidates to the course, holds in His hand the prize of virginity, points to the fountain of purity, and cries aloud[fn-62-P6211_1884691:66-nf] \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\" \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" He does not say, you must drink, you must run, willing or unwilling: but whoever is willingand able to run and to drink, he shall conquer, he shall be satisfied. And therefore Christ loves virgins more than others, because they willingly give what was not commanded them. And it indicates greater grace to offer what you are not bound to give, than to render what is exacted of you. The apostles, contemplating the burden of a wife, exclaimed, \"If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.\" Our Lord thought well of their view. You rightly think, said He, that it is not expedient for a man who is hastening to the kingdom of heaven to take a wife: but it is a hard matter, and all men do not receive the saying, but they to whom it has been given. Some are eunuchs by nature, others by the violence of men. Those eunuchs please Me who are such not of necessity, but of free choice. Willingly do I take them into my bosom who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake, and in order to worship Me have renounced the condition of their birth. We must now explain the words, \"Those who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\" If they who have made themselves eunuchs have the reward of the kingdom of heaven, it follows that they who have not made themselves such cannot be placed with those who have. He who is able, he says, to receive it, let him receive it. It is a mark of great faith and of great virtue, to be the pure temple of God, to offer oneself a whole burnt-offering, and, according to the same apostle, to be holy both in body and in spirit. These are the eunuchs, who thinking themselves dry trees because of their impotence, hear by the mouth of[fn-62-P6212_1886553:67-nf] Isaiah that they have a place prepared in heaven for sons and daughters. Their type is[fn-62-P6213_1886657:68-nf] Ebed-melech the eunuch in Jeremiah, and the eunuch of Queen Candace in the[fn-62-P6214_1886754:69-nf] Acts of the Apostles, who on account of the strength of his faith gained the name of a man. These are they to whom Clement, who was the successor of the Apostle Peter, and of whom the Apostle Paul makes mention, wrote letters, directing almost the whole of his discourse to the subject of virgin purity. After them there is a long series of apostolic men, martyrs, and men illustrious no less for holiness than for eloquence, with whom we may very easily become acquainted through their own writings.[fn-62-P6215_1887275:70-nf] \"I think, therefore,\" he says, \"that this is good for the present distress.\" What is this distress which, in contempt of the marriage tie, longs for the liberty of virginity?[fn-62-P6216_1887471:71-nf] \"Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.\" We have not here a condemnation of harlots and brothels, of whose damnation there is no doubt, but of the swelling womb, and wailing infancy, the fruit as well as the work of marriage. \"For it is good for a man so to be.\" If it is good for a man so to be, it is bad for a man not so to be.[fn-62-P6217_1887864:72-nf] \"Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.\" Each one of us has his appointed bounds; let me have what is mine, and keep your own. If thou art bound to a wife, give her not a bill of divorce. If I am loosed from a wife, I will not seek a wife. As I do not dissolve marriages once contracted: so you should not bind what is loosed. And at the same time the meaning of the words must be taken into account. He who has a wife is regarded as a debtor, and is said to be uncircumcised, to be the servant of his wife, and like bad servants to be bound. But he who has no wife, in the first place owes no man anything, then is circumcised, thirdly is free, lastly, is loosed.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":24,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But as the conquering power of things evil is on the increase-which is the characteristic of the last times[fn-12-P1284_350508:2-nf] -things good are now not allowed either to be born, so corrupted are the seminal principles; or to be trained, so deserted are studies; nor to be enforced, so dined are the laws.

Again, in another part of his letter, that is, towards the end of his own homilies, that he might cheat the ear of the ignorant, he makes a grand parade and noise about the Resurrection, but in ambiguous and balanced language.

I may be permitted to use the actual words and terms with which magic rings again, that inventor of all these odd opinions-with its Ostanes, and Typhon, and Dardanus, and Damigeron, and Nectabis, and Berenice. There is a well-known popular bit of writing,[fn-30-P3067_1109741:328-nf] which undertakes to summon up from the abode of Hades the souls which have actually slept out their full age, and had passed away by an honourable death, and had even been buried with full rites and proper ceremony. What after this shall we say about magic? Say, to be sure, what almost everybody says of it-that it is an imposture. But it is not we Christians only whose notice this system of imposture does not escape. We, it is true, have discovered these spirits of evil, not, to be sure, by a complicity with them, but by a certain knowledge which is hostile to them; nor is it by any procedure which is attractive to them, but by a power which subjugates them that we handle (their wretched system)-that manifold pest of the mind of man, that artificer of all error, that destroyer of our salvation and our soul at one swoop.[fn-30-P3068_1110593:329-nf] In this way, even by magic, which is indeed only a second idolatry, wherein they pretend that after death they become demons, just as they were supposed in the first and literal idolatry to become gods (and why not? since the gods are but dead things), the before-mentioned Aori Biaeothanati are actually invoked,-and not unfairly,[fn-30-P3069_1111060:330-nf] if one grounds his faith on this principle, that it is clearly credible for those souls to be beyond all others addicted to violence and wrong, which with violence and wrong have been hurried away by a cruel and premature death and which would have a keen appetite for reprisals. Under cover, however, of these souls, demons operate, especially such as used to dwell in them when they were in life, and who had driven them, in fact, to the fate which had at last carried them off. For, as we have already suggested,[fn-30-P3070_1111590:331-nf] there is hardly a human being who is unattended by a demon; and it is well known to many, that premature and violent deaths, which men ascribe to accidents, are in fact brought about by demons. This imposture of the evil spirit lying concealed in the persons of the dead, we are able, if I mistake not, to prove by actual facts, when in cases of exorcism (the evil spirit) affirms himself sometimes to be one of the relatives[fn-30-P3071_1112052:332-nf] of the person possessed by him, sometimes a gladiator or a bestiarius,[fn-30-P3072_1112153:333-nf] and sometimes even a god; always making it one of his chief cares to extinguish the very truth which we are proclaiming, that men may not readily believe that all souls remove to Hades, and that they may overthrow faith in the resurrection and the judgment. And yet for all that, the demon, after trying to circumvent the bystanders, is vanquished by the pressure of divine grace, and sorely against his will confesses all the truth. So also in that other kind of magic, which is supposed to bring up from Hades the souls now resting there, and to exhibit them to public view, there is no other expedient of imposture ever resorted to which operates more powerfully. Of course, why a phantom becomes visible, is because a body is also attached to it; and it is no difficult matter to delude the external vision of a man whose mental eye it is so easy to blind. The serpents which emerged from the magicians' rods, certainly appeared to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians as bodily substances. It is true that the verity of Moses swallowed up their lying deceit.[fn-30-P3073_1113321:334-nf] Many attempts were also wrought against the apostles by the sorcerers Simon and Elymas,[fn-30-P3074_1113429:335-nf] but the blindness which struck (them) was no enchanter's trick. What novelty is there in the effort of an unclean spirit to counterfeit the truth? At this very time, even, the heretical dupes of this same Simon (Magus) are so much elated by the extravagant pretensions of their art, that they undertake to bring up from Hades the souls of the prophets themselves. And I suppose that they can do so under cover of a lying wonder. For, indeed, it was no less than this that was anciently permitted to the Pythonic (or ventriloquistic) spirit[fn-30-P3075_1114000:336-nf] -even to represent the soul of Samuel, when Saul consulted the dead, after (losing the living) God.[fn-30-P3076_1114147:337-nf] God forbid, however, that we should suppose that the soul of any saint, much less of a prophet, can be dragged out of (its resting-place in Hades) by a demon. We know that \"Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light\"[fn-30-P3077_1114401:338-nf] -much more into a man of light-and that at last he will \"show himself to be even God,\"[fn-30-P3078_1114510:339-nf] and will exhibit \"great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, he shall deceive the very elect.\"[fn-30-P3079_1114646:340-nf] He hardly[fn-30-P3080_1114679:341-nf] hesitated on the before-mentioned occasion to affirm himself to be a prophet of God, and especially to Saul, in whom he was then actually dwelling. You must not imagine that he who produced the phantom was one, and he who consulted it was another; but that it was one and the same spirit, both in the sorceress and in the apostate (king), which easily pretended an apparition of that which it had already prepared them to believe as real-(even the spirit) through whose evil influence Saul's heart was fixed where his treasure was, and where certainly God was not. Therefore it came about, that he saw him through whose aid he believed that he was going to see, because he believed him through whose help he saw. But we are met with the objection, that in visions of the night dead persons are not unfrequently seen, and that for a set purpose.[fn-30-P3081_1115539:342-nf] For instance, the Nasamones consult private oracles by frequent and lengthened visits to the sepulchres of their relatives, as one may find in Heraclides, or Nymphodorus, or Herodotus;[fn-30-P3082_1115744:343-nf] and the Celts, for the game purpose, stay away all night at the tombs of their brave chieftains, as Nicander affirms. Well, we admit apparitions of dead persons in dreams to be not more really true than those of living persons; but we apply the same estimate to all alike-to the dead and to the living, and indeed to all the phenomena which are seen. Now things are not true because they appear to be so, but because they are fully proved to be so. The truth of dreams is declared from the realization, not the aspect. Moreover, the fact that Hades is not in any case opened for (the escape of) any soul, has been firmly established by the Lord in the person of Abraham, in His representation of the poor man at rest and the rich man in torment.[fn-30-P3083_1116509:344-nf] No one, (he said, ) could possibly be despatched from those abodes to report to us how matters went in the nether regions,-a purpose which, (if any could be, ) might have been allowable on such an occasion, to persuade a belief in Moses and the prophets. The power of God has, no doubt, sometimes recalled men's souls to their bodies, as a proof of His own transcendent rights; but there must never be, because of this fact, any agreement supposed to be possible between the divine faith and the arrogant pretensions of sorcerers, and the imposture of dreams, and the licence of poets. But yet in all cases of a true resurrection, when the power of God recalls souls to their bodies, either by the agency of prophets, or of Christ, or of apostles, a complete presumption is afforded us, by the solid, palpable, and ascertained reality (of the revived body), that its true form must be such as to compel one's belief of the fraudulence of every incorporeal apparition of dead persons.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":24,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But so far as regards this question of mental perturbations, we have answered these philosophers in the ninth book[fn-23-P2376_1333348:50-nf] of this work, showing that it is rather a verbal than a real dispute, and that they seek contention rather than truth.

And yet the more friends we have, and the more widely they are scattered, the more numerous are our fears that some portion of the vast masses of the disasters of life may light upon them. For we are not only anxious lest they suffer from famine, war, disease, captivity, or the inconceivable horrors of slavery, but we are also affected with the much more painful dread that their friendship may be changed into perfidy, malice, and injustice. And when these contingencies actually occur,-as they do the more frequently the more friends we have, and the more widely they are scattered,-and when they come to our knowledge, who but the man who has experienced it can tell with what pangs the heart is torn? We would, in fact, prefer to hear that they were dead, although we could not without anguish hear of even this. For if their life has solaced us with the charms of friendship, can it be that their death should affect us with no sadness? He who will have none of this sadness must, if possible, have no friendly intercourse. Let him interdict or extinguish friendly affection; let him burst with ruthless insensibility the bonds of every human relationship; or let him contrive so to use them that no sweetness shall distil into his spirit. But if this is utterly impossible, how shall we contrive to feel no bitterness in the death of those whose life has been sweet to us? Hence arises that grief which affects the tender heart like a wound or a bruise, and which is healed by the application of kindly consolation. For though the cure is affected all the more easily and rapidly the better condition the soul is in, we must not on this account suppose that there is nothing at all to heal. Although, then, our present life is afflicted, sometimes in a milder, sometimes in a more painful degree, by the death of those very dear to us, and especially of useful public men, yet we would prefer to hear that such men were dead rather than to hear or perceive that they had fallen from the faith, or from virtue,-in other words, that they were spiritually dead. Of this vast material for misery the earth is full, and therefore it is written, \"Is not human life upon earth a trial?\"[fn-36-P3658_2004920:16-nf] And with the same reference the Lord says. \"Woe to the world because of offenses!\"[fn-36-P3659_2005020:17-nf] and again, \"Because iniquity abounded, the love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-36-P3660_2005113:18-nf] And hence we enjoy some gratification when our good friends die; for though their death leaves us in sorrow, we have the consolatory assurance that they are beyond the ills by which in this life even the best of men are broken down or corrupted, or are in danger of both results.","title":"Book XIX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"121","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Having then this hope, let our souls be bound to Him who is faithful in His promises, and just in His judgments.

The same Saviour is spoken of in Daniel, where the Son of man appears before the Ancient of days, and receives a kingdom without end, that all nations may serve Him.[fn-14-P1497_805869:76-nf] In the passage quoted from Daniel by the Lord Himself, \"When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, let him that readeth understand,\"[fn-14-P1498_806092:77-nf] the number of weeks points not only to Christ, but to the very time of His advent. With the Jews, who look to Christ for salvation as we do, but deny that He has come and suffered, we can argue from actual events. Besides the conversion of the heathen, now so universal, as prophesied of Christ in their own Scriptures, there are the events in the history of the Jews themselves. Their holy place is thrown down, the sacrifice has ceased, and the priest, and the ancient anointing; which was all clearly foretold by Daniel when he prophesied of the anointing of the Most Holy.[fn-14-P1499_806690:78-nf] Now, that all these things have taken place, we ask the Jews for the anointed Most Holy, and they have no answer to give. But it is from the Old Testament that the Jews derive all the knowledge they have of Christ and His advent. Why do they ask John whether he is Christ? Why do they say to the Lord, \"How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.\" Why do Peter and Andrew and Philip say to Nathanael, \"We have found Messias, which is interpreted Christ,\" but because this name was known to them from the prophecies of their Scriptures? In no other nation were the kings and priests anointed, and called Anointed or Christs. Nor could this symbolical anointing be discontinued till the coming of Him who was thus prefigured. For among all their anointed ones the Jews looked for one who was to save them. But in the mysterious justice of God they were blinded; and thinking only of the power of the Messiah, they did not understand His weakness, in which He died for us. In the book of Wisdom it is prophesied of the Jews: \"Let us condemn him to an ignominious death; for he will be proved in his words. If he is truly the Son of God, He will aid him; and deliver him from the hand of his enemies. Thus they thought, and erred; for their wickedness blinded them.\"[fn-15-P1500_808009:79-nf] These words apply also to those who, in spite of all these evidences, in spite of such a series of prophecies, and of their fulfillment, still deny that Christ is foretold in the Scriptures. As often as they repeat this denial, we can produce fresh proofs, with the help of Him who has made such provision against human perversity, that proofs already given need not be repeated.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Now the devil was thus bound not only when the Church began to be more and more widely extended among the nations beyond Judea, but is now and shall be bound till the end of the world, when he is to be loosed. Because even now men are, and doubtless to the end of the world shall be, converted to the faith from the unbelief in which he held them. And this strong one is bound in each instance in which he is spoiled of one of his goods; and the abyss in which he is shut up is not at an end when those die who were alive when first he was shut up in it, but these have been succeeded, and shall to the end of the world be succeeded, by others born after them with a like hate of the Christians, and in the depth of whose blind hearts he is continually shut up as in an abyss. But it is a question whether, during these three years and six months when he shall be loose, and raging with all his force, any one who has not previously believed shall attach himself to the faith. For how in that case would the words hold good, \"Who entereth into the house of a strong one to spoil his goods, unless first he shall have bound the strong one?\" Consequently this verse seems to compel us to believe that during that time, short as it is, no one will be added to the Christian community, but that the devil will make war with those who have previously become Christians, and that, though some of these may be conquered and desert to the devil, these do not belong to the predestinated number of the sons of God. For it is not without reason that John, the same apostle as wrote this Apocalypse, says in his epistle regarding certain persons, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us.\"[fn-38-P3844_2116620:40-nf] But what shall become of the little ones? For it is beyond all belief that in these days there shall not be found some Christian children born, but not yet baptized, and that there shall not also be some born during that very period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their parents shall not find some way of bringing them to the laver of regeneration. But if this shall be the case, how shall these goods be snatched from the devil when he is loose, since into his house no man enters to spoil his goods unless he has first bound him? On the contrary, we are rather to believe that in these days there shall be no lack either of those who fall away from, or of those who attach themselves to the Church; but there shall be such resoluteness, both in parents to seek baptism for their little ones, and in those who shall then first believe, that they shall conquer that strong one, even though unbound,-that is, shall both vigilantly comprehend, and patiently bear up against him, though employing such wiles and putting forth such force as he never before used; and thus they shall be snatched from him even though unbound. And yet the verse of the Gospel will not be untrue, \"Who entereth into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?\" For in accordance with this true saying that order is observed-the strong one first bound, and then his goods spoiled; for the Church is so increased by the weak and strong from all nations far and near, that by its most robust faith in things divinely predicted and accomplished, it shall be able to spoil the goods of even the unbound devil. For as we must own that, \"when iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold,\"[fn-38-P3845_2118369:41-nf] and that those who have not been written in the book of life shall in large numbers yield to the severe and unprecedented persecutions and stratagems of the devil now loosed, so we cannot but think that not only those whom that time shall find sound in the faith, but also some who till then shall be without, shall become firm in the faith they have hitherto rejected and mighty to conquer the devil even though unbound, God's grace aiding them to understand the Scriptures, in which, among other things, there is foretold that very end which they themselves see to be arriving. And if this shall be so, his binding is to be spoken of as preceding, that there might follow a spoiling of him both bound and loosed; for it is of this it is said, \"Who shall enter into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?\"","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"There are many allusions to the last judgment in the Psalms, but for the most part only casual and slight.

But perhaps you believe the common report about Christ. Faustus makes a feeble suggestion of this kind as a last resource, to escape being obliged either to produce his worthless authorities, or to come under the power of those opposed to him. Well, if report is your authority, you should consider the consequences of trusting to such evidence. There are many bad things reported of you which you do not wish people to believe. Is it reasonable to make the same evidence true about Christ and false about yourselves? In fact, you deny the common report about Christ. For the report most widely spread, and which every one has heard repeated, is that which distinctly asserts that Christ was born of the seed of David, according to the promise made in the Hebrew Scriptures to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob: \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\" You will not admit this Hebrew testimony, but you do not seem to have any other. The authority of our books, which is confirmed by the agreement of so many nations, supported by a succession of apostles, bishops, and councils, is against you. Your books have no authority, for it is an authority maintained by only a few, and these the worshippers ofan untruthful God and Christ. If they are not following the example of the beings they worship, their testimony must be against their own false doctrine. And, once more, common report gives a very bad account of you, and invariably asserts, in opposition to you, that Christ was of the seed of David. You did not hear the voice of the Father from heaven. You did not see the works by which Christ bore witness to Himself. The books which tell of these things you profess to receive, that you may maintain a delusive appearance of Christianity; but when anything is quoted against you, you say that the books have been tampered with. You quote the passage where Christ says, \"If ye believe not me, believe the works;\" and again, \"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me;\" but you will not let us quote in reply such passages as these: \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think that ye have eternal life, and they are they that testify of me;\" \"If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me, for he wrote of me;\" \"They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them;\" \"If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe though one rose from the dead.\" What have you to say for yourselves? Where is your authority? If you reject these passages of Scripture, in spite of the weighty authority in their favor, what miracles can you show? However, if you did work miracles, we should be on our guard against receiving their evidence in your case; for the Lord has forewarned us: \"Many false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall do many signs and wonders, that they may deceive, if it were possible, the very elect: behold, I have told you before.\"[fn-15-P1528_826956:7-nf] This shows that the established authority of Scripture must outweigh every other; for it derives new confirmation from the progress of events which happen, as Scripture proves, in fulfillment of the predictions made so long before their occurrence.6. Are, then, your doctrines so manifestly true, that they require no support from miracles or from any testimony? Show us these self-evident truths, if you have anything of the kind to show. Your legends, as we have already seen, are long and silly, old wives fables for the amusement of women and children. The beginning is detached from the rest, the middle is unsound, and the end is a miserable failure. If you begin with the immortal, invisible, incorruptible God, what need was there of His fighting with the race of darkness? And as for the middle of your theory, what becomes of the incorruptibility and unchangeableness of God, when His members in fruits and vegetables are purified by your mastication and digestion? And for the end, is it just that the wretched soul should be punished with lasting confinement in the mass of darkness, because its God is unable to cleanse it of the defilement contracted from evil external to itself in the fulfillment of His own commission? You are at a loss for a reply. See the worthlessness of your boasted manuscripts, numerous and valuable as you say they are! Alas for the toils of the antiquaries! Alas for the property of the unhappy owners! Alas for the food of the deluded followers! Destitute as you are of Scripture authority, of the power of miracles, of moral excellence, and of sound doctrine, depart ashamed, and return penitent, confessing that true Christ, who is the Saviour of all who believe in Him, whose name and whose Church are now displayed as they were of old foretold, not by some being issuing from subterranean darkness, but by a nation in a distinct kingdom established for this purpose, that there those things might be figuratively predicted of Christ which are now in reality fulfilled, and the prophets might foretell in writing what the apostles now exhibit in their preaching.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_29_4_a_strain_of_the_judgment_of_the_lord_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"ANF-04","text":"180 And deeply moved are the high air's powers,[fn-29-P2977_665724:30-nf] ","title":"4.

But let us continue our explanation: \"Let it divide the waters froth the waters.\"[fn-21-P2152_638168:22-nf] The mass of waters, which from all directions flowed over the earth, and was suspended in the air, was infinite, so that there was no proportion between it and the other elements. Thus, as it has been already said, the abyss covered the earth. We give the reason for this abundance of water. None of you assuredly will attack our opinion; not even those who have the most cultivated minds, and whose piercing eye can penetrate this perishable and fleeting nature; you will not accuse me of advancing impossible or imaginary theories, nor will you ask me upon what foundation the fluid clement rests. By the same reason which makes them attract the earth, heavier than water, from the extremities of the world to suspend it in the centre, they will grant us without doubt that it is due both to its natural attraction downwards and its general equilibrium, that this immense quantity of water rests motionless upon the earth.[fn-21-P2153_639109:23-nf] Therefore the prodigious mass of waters was spread around the earth; not in proportion with it and infinitely larger, thanks to the foresight of the supreme Artificer, Who, from the beginning, foresaw what was to come, and at the first provided all for the future needs of the world. But what need was there for this superabundance of water? The essence of fire is necessary for the world, not only in the economy of earthly produce, but for the completion of the universe; for it would be imperfect[fn-21-P2154_639982:24-nf] if the most powerful and the most vital of its elements were lacking.[fn-21-P2155_640109:25-nf] Now fire and water are hostile to and destructive of each other. Fire, if it is the stronger, destroys water, and water, if in greater abundance, destroys fire. As, therefore, it was necessary to avoid an open struggle between these elements, so as not to bring about the dissolution of the universe by the total disappearance of one or the other, the sovereign Disposer created such a quantity of water that in spite of constant diminution from the effects of fire, it could last until the time fixed for the destruction of the world. He who planned all with weight and measure, He who, according to the word of Job, knows the number of the drops of rain,[fn-21-P2156_640985:26-nf] knew how long His work would last, and for how much consumption of fire He ought to allow. This is the reason of the abundance of water at the creation. Further, there is no one so strange to life as to need to learn the reason why fire is essential to the world. Not only all the arts which support life, the art of weaving, that of shoemaking, of architecture, of agriculture, have need of the help of fire, but the vegetation of trees, the ripening of fruits, the breeding of land and water animals, and their nourishment, all existed from heat from the beginning, and have been since maintained by the action of heat. The creation of heat was then indispensable for the formation and the preservation of beings, and the abundance of waters was no less so in the presence of the constant and inevitable consumption by fire.","title":"Homily III.-On the Firmament.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":24,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"446","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"To what has been said it must also be added that we must not affirm that after the ascension the Lord Christ is not Christ but only begotten Son.

The impudence, therefore, of Marcion's Christ will be evident, when he says that many will come in his name, whereas this name does not at all belong to him, since he is not the Christ and Jesus of the Creator, to whom these names do properly appertain; and more especially when he prohibits those to be received whose very equal in imposture he is, inasmuch as he (equally with them[fn-68-P6888_2005048:1535-nf] ) comes in a name which belongs to another-unless it was his business to warn off from a mendaciously assumed name the disciples (of One) who, by reason of His name being properly given to Him, possessed also the verity thereof. But when \"they shall by and by come and say, I am Christ,\"[fn-68-P6889_2005354:1536-nf] they will be received by you, who have already received one altogether like them.[fn-68-P6890_2005458:1537-nf] Christ, however, comes in His own name. What will you do, then, when He Himself comes who is the very Proprietor of these names, the Creator's Christ and Jesus? Will you reject Him? But how iniquitous, how unjust and disrespectful to the good God, that you should not receive Him who comes in His own name, when you have received another in His name! Now, let us see what are the signs which He ascribes to the times. \"Wars,\" I observe, \"and kingdom against kingdom, and nation against nation, and pestilence, and famines, and earthquakes, and fearful sights, and great signs from heaven\"[fn-68-P6891_2006143:1538-nf] -all which things are suitable for a severe and terrible God. Now, when He goes on to say that \"all these things must needs come to pass,\"[fn-68-P6892_2006307:1539-nf] what does He represent Himself to be? The Destroyer, or the Defender of the Creator? For He affirms thai these appointments of His must fully come to pass; but surely as the good God, He would have frustrated rather than advanced events so sad and terrible, if they had not been His own (decrees). \"But before all these,\" He foretells that persecutions and sufferings were to come upon them, which indeed were \"to turn for a testimony to them,\" and for their salvation.[fn-68-P6893_2006846:1540-nf] Hear what is predicted in Zechariah: \"The Lord of hosts[fn-68-P6894_2006926:1541-nf] shall protect them; and they shall devour them, and subdue them with sling-stones; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and they shall fill the bowls as it were of the altar. And the Lord shall save them in that day, even His people, like sheep; because as sacred stones they roll,\"[fn-68-P6895_2007273:1542-nf] etc. And that you may not suppose that these predictions refer to such sufferings as await them from so many wars with strangers,[fn-68-P6896_2007443:1543-nf] consider the nature (of the sufferings). In a prophecy of wars which were to be waged with legitimate arms, no one would think of enumerating stones as weapons, which are better known in popular crowds and unarmed tumults. Nobody measures the copious streams of blood which flow in war by bowlfuls, nor limits it to what is shed upon a single altar. No one gives the name of sheep to those who fall in battle with arms in hand, and while repelling force with force, but only to those who are slain, yielding themselves up in their own place of duty and with patience, rather than fighting in self-defence. In short, as he says, \"they roll as sacred stones,\" and not like soldiers fight. Stones are they, even foundation stones, upon which we are ourselves edified-\"built,\" as St. Paul says, \"upon the foundation of the apostles,\"[fn-68-P6897_2008294:1544-nf] who, like \"consecrated stones,\" were rolled up and down exposed to the attack of all men. And therefore in this passage He forbids men \"to meditate before what they answer\" when brought before tribunals,[fn-68-P6898_2008520:1545-nf] even as once He suggested to Balaam the message which he had not thought of,[fn-68-P6899_2008623:1546-nf] nay, contrary to what he had thought; and promised \"a mouth\" to Moses, when he pleaded in excuse the slowness of his speech,[fn-69-P6900_2008774:1547-nf] and that wisdom which, by Isaiah, He showed to be irresistible: \"One shall say, I am the Lord's, and shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe himself by the name of lsrµl.\"[fn-69-P6901_2008999:1548-nf] Now, what plea is wiser and more irresistible than the simple and open\"[fn-69-P6902_2009094:1549-nf] confession made in a martyr's cause, who \"prevails with God\"-which is what \"Israel\" means?[fn-69-P6903_2009202:1550-nf] Now, one cannot wonder that He forbade \"premeditation,\" who actually Himself received from the Father the ability of uttering words in season: \"The Lord hath given to me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season (to him that is weary); \"[fn-69-P6904_2009503:1551-nf] except that Marcion introduces to us a Christ who is not subject to the Father. That persecutions from one's nearest friends are predicted, and calumny out of hatred to His name,[fn-69-P6905_2009702:1552-nf] I need not again refer to. But \"by patience,\"[fn-69-P6906_2009775:1553-nf] says He, \"ye shall yourselves be saved.\"[fn-69-P6907_2009855:1554-nf] Of this very patience the Psalm says, \"The patient endurance of the just shall not perish for ever; \"[fn-69-P6908_2010006:1555-nf] because it is said in another Psalm, \"Precious (in the sight of the Lord) is the death of the just\"-arising, no doubt, out of their patient endurance, so that Zechariah declares: \"A crown shall be to them that endure.\"[fn-69-P6909_2010246:1556-nf] But that you may not boldly contend that it was as announcers of another god that the apostles were persecuted by the Jews, remember that even the prophets suffered the same treatment of the Jews, and that they were not the heralds of any other god than the Creator. Then, having shown what was to be the period of the destruction, even \"when Jerusalem should begin to be compassed with armies,\"[fn-69-P6910_2010774:1557-nf] He described the signs of the end of all things: \"portents in the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity-like the sea roaring-by reason of their expectation of the evils which are coming on the earth.\"[fn-69-P6911_2011047:1558-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":24,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_30_commentary_on_the_apocalypse_of_the_blessed_john","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-07","text":"1, 2. \"And when the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals, I saw, and heard one of the four living creatures saying, Come and see.

For [in proof that Mark's order is essentially the same as Matthew's, we need only notice that] in Mark's version also, after the account of the Lord's discussion with the Jews on the occasion when He asked them how they held Christ to be David's son, we have a narrative of what He said in warning them against the Pharisees and their hypocrisy,-a section which Matthew has presented on the amplest scale, introducing into it a larger number of the Lord's sayings on that occasion. Then after this paragraph, which has been handled briefly by Mark, and treated with great fulness by Matthew, Mark, as I have said, introduces the passage about the widow who was at once so extremely poor, and yet abounded so remarkably. And finally, without interpolating anything else, he subjoins a section in which he comes again into unison with Matthew,-namely, that relating to the destruction of the temple. In like manner, Luke first states the question which was propounded regarding Christ, as to how He was the son of David, and then mentions a few of the words which were spoken in cautioning them against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees.

Luke's method of putting it, again, is neither, \"And when ye shall see the abomination of desolation stand in the holy place,\" nor \"where it ought not,\" but, \"And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with an army, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.\"[fn-21-P2182_911023:535-nf] At that time, therefore, will the abomination of desolation be in the holy place.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":79,"source_paragraph":"313","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"150.

On the other hand, Luke's version proceeds thus: \"Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains.\"[fn-21-P2185_911588:537-nf] Thus far he agrees with the other two. But he presents what is subsequent to that in a different form. For he goes on to say, \"And let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto: for these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.\" Now these statements seem to present differences enough between each other. For the one, as it occurs in the first two evangelists, runs thus: \"Let him which is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house;\" whereas what is given by the third evangelist is to this effect: \"And let them which are in the midst of it depart out.\" The import, however, may be, that in the great agitation which will arise in the face of so mighty an impending peril, those shut up in the state of siege (which is expressed by the phrase, \"they which are in the midst of it\") will appear upon the housetop [or \"wall\"], amazed and anxious to see what terror hangs over them, or what method of escape may open. Still the question rises, How does this third evangelist say here, \"let them depart out,\" when he has already used these terms: \"And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with an army\"? For what is brought in after this-namely, the sentence, \"And let not them that are in the countries enter there-into \"-appears to form part of one consistent admonition; and we can perceive how those who are outside the city are not to enter into it; but the difficulty is to see how those who are in the midst of it are to depart out, when the city is already compassed with an army. Well, may not this expression, \"in the midst of it,\" indicate a time when the danger will be so urgent as to leave no opportunity open, so far as temporal means are concerned, for the preservation of this present life in the body, and that the fact that this will be a time when the soul ought to be ready and free, and neither taken up with, nor burdened by, carnal desires, is imported by the phrase employed by the first two writers-namely, \"on the house-top,\" or, \"on the wall\"? In this way the third evangelist's phraseology, \"let them depart out\" (which really means, let them no more be engrossed with the desire of this life, but let them be prepared to pass into another life), is equivalent in sense to the terms used by the other two,\" let him not come down to take anything out of his house\" (which really means, \"let not his affections turn towards the flesh, as if it could yield him anything to his advantage then\"). And in like manner the phrase adopted by the one, \"And let not them that are in the countries enter thereunto\" (which is to say, \"Let not those who, with good purpose of heart, have already placed themselves outside it, indulge again in any carnal lust or longing after it\"), denotes precisely what the other two evangelists embody in the sentence, \"Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes,\" which is much the same as to state that he should not again involve himself in cares of which he had been unburdened.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_25_book_vii_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"The emperor, about this period, condemned Eunomius to banishment.[fn-44-P4411_1967365:36-nf] This heretic had fixed his residence in the suburbs of Constantinople, and held frequent churches in private houses, where he read his own writings. He induced many to embrace his sentiments, so that the sectarians, who were named after him, became very numerous. He died not long after his banishment, and was interred at Dacora, his birthplace, a village of Cappadocia, situated near Mount Argeus, in the territory of Caesarea. Theophronius, who was also a native of Cappadocia, and who had been his disciple, continued to promulgate his doctrines. Having gotten a smattering, through the writings of Aristotle, he composed an introduction to the study of the syllogisms in them, which he entitled \"Exercises for the Mind.\" But he afterwards engaged, I have understood, in many unprofitable disputations, and soon ceased to confine himself to the doctrines of his master. But being eager for new things, he endeavored to prove, from the terms which are placed in the Sacred Scriptures, that though God foreknows that which is not, and knows that which is, and remembers what has happened, he does not always have that knowledge in the same manner with respect to the future and present, and changes his knowledge of the past. As this hypothesis appeared positively absurd to the Eunomians, they excommunicated him from their church; and he constituted himself the leader of a new sect, called, after his name, Theophronians. Not long after, Eutychus, one of the Eunomians, originated another sect in Constantinople, to which his own name was given. For the question had been proposed, as to whether the Son of God is or is not acquainted with the last hour; and for its solution, the words of the evangelist were quoted, in which it is stated that the day and hour are known only to the Father.[fn-44-P4412_1969236:37-nf] Eutychus, however, contended that this knowledge belongs also to the Son, inasmuch as He has received all things from the Father. The Eunomian presidents, having condemned this opinion, he seceded from communion with them, and went to join Eunomius in his place of banishment. A deacon, and some other individuals, who had been dispatched from Constantinople to accuse Eutychus, and, if necessary, to oppose him in argument, arrived first at the place of destination. When Eunomius was made acquainted with the object of their journey, he expressed himself in favor of the sentiments propounded by Eutychus; and, on his arrival, prayed with him, although it was not lawful to pray with any one who travels unprovided with letters written in sacred characters, attesting his being in communion. Eunomius died soon after this contention; and the Eunomian president, at Constantinople, refused to receive Eutychus into communion; for he antagonized him from jealousy because he was not even of clerical rank, and because he could not answer his arguments, and did not find it possible to solve his problems. Eutychus, therefore, separated those who had espoused his sentiments into a personal heresy. Many assert that he and Theophronius were the first who propounded the peculiar views entertained by the Eunomians concerning divine baptism. The above is a brief account of such details as I have been able to give in order to afford a succinct knowledge of the causes which led the Eunomians to be divided among themselves. I should be prolix were I to enter into further particulars; and, indeed, the subject would be by no means an easy one to me, since I have no such dialectic skill.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":24,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_114_letter_lx_to_adelphius_bishop_and_confessor_against_the_arians_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"7.

But these things have I told you, that when the hour shall come ye may remember them, because I told you.\"[fn-78-P7863_2634294:84-nf] And again: \"Verily, verily, I say unto yon, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.\"[fn-78-P7864_2634484:85-nf] And again: \"These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace; but in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good confidence, for I have overcome the world.\"[fn-78-P7865_2634685:86-nf] And when He was interrogated by His disciples concerning the sign of His coming, and of the consummation of the world, He answered and said: \"Take care lest any deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall begin to hear of wars, and rumours of wars; see that ye be not troubled: for these things must needs come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and earthquakes, and pestilences, in every place. But all these things are the beginnings of travailings. Then they shall deliver you up into affliction, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hateful to all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall arise, and shall seduce many; and because wickedness shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he who shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached through all the world, for a testimony to all nations; and then shall come the end. When, therefore, ye shall see the abomination of desolation which is spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who readeth understand), then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let him which is on the house-roof not go down to take anything from the house; and let him who is in the field not return back to carry away his clothes. But woe to them that are pregnant, and to those that are giving suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath-day: for there shall be great tribulation, such as has not arisen from the beginning of the world until now, neither shall arise. And unless those days should be shortened, no flesh should be saved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. Then if any one shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or, Lo, there; believe him not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, to cause error, if it be possible, even to the elect. But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. If, therefore, they shall say to you, Lo, he is in the desert; go not forth: lo, he is in the sleeping chambers; believe it not. For as the flashing of lightning goeth forth from the east, and appeareth even to the west, so also shall the coming of the Son of man be. Wheresoever the carcase shall be, there shall the eagles be gathered together. But immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be moved: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and all the tribes of the earth shall lament, and shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory. And He shall send His angels with a great trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the heights of heaven, even into the farthest bounds thereof.\"[fn-78-P7866_2637853:87-nf] And these are not new or sudden things which are now happening to Christians; since the good and righteous, and those who are devoted to God in the law of innocence and the fear of true religion, advance always through afflictions, and wrongs, and the severe and manifold penalties of troubles, in the hardship of a narrow path. Thus, at the very beginning of the world, the righteous Abel was the first to be shin by his brother; and Jacob was driven into exile, and Joseph was sold, and king Saul persecuted the merciful David; and king Ahab endeavoured to oppress Elias, who firmly and bravely asserted the majesty of God. Zacharias the priest was slain between the temple and the altar, that himself might there become a sacrifice where he was accustomed to offer sacrifices to God. So many martyrdoms of the righteous have, in fact, often been celebrated; so many examples of faith and virtue have been set forth to future generations. The three youths, Ananias, Azarias, and Misäel, equal in age, agreeing in love, stedfast in faith, constant in virtue, stronger than the flames and penalties that urged them, proclaim that they only obey God, that they know Him alone, that they worship Him alone, saying: \"O king Nebuchodonosor, there is no need for us to answer thee in this matter. For the God whom we serve is able to deliver us out of the furnace of burning fire; and He will deliver us from thy hands, O king. And if not, be it known unto thee, that we do not serve thy gods, and we do not adore the golden image which thou hast set up.\"[fn-78-P7867_2639427:88-nf] And Daniel, devoted to God, and filled with the Holy Spirit, exclaims and says: \"I worship nothing but the Lord my God, who founded the heaven and the earth.\"[fn-78-P7868_2639608:89-nf] Tobias also, although under a royal and tyrannical slavery, yet in feeling and spirit free, maintains his confession to God, and sublimely announces both the divine power and majesty, saying: \"In the land of my captivity I confess to Him, and I show forth His power in a sinful nation.\"[fn-78-P7869_2639924:90-nf] What, indeed, do we find in the Maccabees of seven brethren, equals alike in their lot of birth and virtues, filling up the number seven in the sacrament of a perfected completion? Seven brethren were thus associating in martyrdom. As the first seven days in the divine arrangement containing seven thousand of years,[fn-78-P7870_2640261:91-nf] as the seven spirits and seven angels which stand and go in and out before the face of God, and the seven-branched lamp in the tabernacle of witness, and the seven golden candlesticks in the Apocalypse, and the seven columns in Solomon upon which Wisdom built her house l so here also the number seven of the brethren, embracing, in the quantity of their number, the seven churches, as likewise in the first book of Kings we read that the barren hath borne seven. And in Isaiah seven women lay hold on one man, whose name they ask to be called upon them. And the Apostle Paul, who refers to this lawful and certain number, writes to the seven churches. And in the Apocalypse the Lord directs His divine and heavenly precepts to the seven churches and their angels, which number is now found in this case, in the seven brethren, that a lawful consummation may be completed. With the seven children is manifestly associated also the mother, their origin and root, who subsequently begat seven churches, she herself having been first, and alone founded upon a rock[fn-78-P7871_2641396:92-nf] by the voice of the Lord.[fn-78-P7872_2641526:93-nf] Nor is it of no account that in their sufferings the mother alone is with her children. For martyrs who witness themselves as the sons of God in suffering are now no more counted as of any father but God, as in the Gospel the Lord teaches, saying, \"Call no man your father upon earth; for one is your Father, which is in heaven.\"[fn-78-P7873_2641988:94-nf] ","title":"Treatise XI.

For not \"the world\" but the \"fashion of this world\" passeth away,[fn-57-P5790_1749089:24-nf] it is said; so it is usual for the Scriptures to call the change from an earlier form to a better and more comely state, destruction; just as when one calls by the name of destruction the change from a childish form into a perfect man, as the stature of the child is turned into manly size and beauty. We may expect that the creation will pass away, as if it were to perish in the burning, in order that it may be renewed, not however that it will be destroyed, that we who are renewed may dwell in a renewed world without taste of sorrow; according as it is said, \"When Thou lettest Thy breath go forth, they shall be made, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth; \"[fn-57-P5791_1749781:25-nf] God henceforth providing for the due temperature of that which surrounds it.

The second rule is about the twofold division of the body of the Lord; but this indeed is not a suitable name, for that is really no part of the body of Christ which will not be with Him in eternity. We ought, therefore, to say that the rule is about the true and the mixed body of the Lord, or the true and the counterfeit, or some such name; because, not to speak of eternity, hypocrites cannot even now be said to be in Him, although they seem to be in His Church. And hence this rule might be designated thus: Concerning the mixed Church. Now this rule requires the reader to be on his guard when Scripture, although it has now come to address or speak of a different set of persons, seems to be addressing or speaking of the same persons as before, just as if both sets constituted one body in consequence of their being for the time united in a common participation of the sacraments. An example of this is that passage in the Song of Solomon, \"I am black, but comely, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.\"[fn-52-P5226_2777735:68-nf] For it is not said, I was black as the tents of Kedar, but am now comely as the curtains of Solomon.

I think we should take the higher and truer view, and say at once that none of that evil in life, which is visible in all its business and in all its pursuits, can have any hold over a man, if he will not put himself in the fetters of this course. The truth of what we say will be clear thus. A man who, seeing through the illusion with the eye of his spirit purged, lifts himself above the struggling world, and, to use the words of the Apostle, slights it all as but dung, in a way exiling himself altogether from human life by his abstinence from marriage,-that man has no fellowship whatever with the sins of mankind, such as avarice, envy, anger, hatred, and everything of the kind. He has an exemption from all this, and is in every way free and at peace; there is nothing in him to provoke his neighbours' envy, because he clutches none of those objects round which envy in this life gathers. He has raised his own life above the world, and prizing virtue as his only precious possession he will pass his days in painless peace and quiet. For virtue is a possession which, though all according to their capacity should share it, yet will be always in abundance for those who thirst after it; unlike the occupation of the lands on this earth, which men divide into sections, and the more they add to the one the more they take from the other, so that the one person's gain is his fellow's loss; whence arise the fights for the lion's share, from men's hatred of being cheated. But the larger owner of this possession is never envied; he who snatches the lion's share does no damage to him who claims equal participation; as each is capable each has this noble longing satisfied, while the wealth of virtues in those who are already occupiers[fn-26-P2676_1829327:17-nf] is not exhausted. The man, then, who, with his eyes only on such a life, makes virtue, which has no limit that man can devise, his only treasure, will surely never brook to bend his soul to any of those low courses which multitudes tread. He will not admire earthly riches, or human power, or any of those things which folly seeks. If, indeed, his mind is still pitched so low, he is outside our band of novices, and our words do not apply to him. But if his thoughts are above, walking as it were with God, he will be lifted out of the maze of all these errors; for the predisposing cause of them all, marriage, has not touched him. Now the wish to be before others is the deadly sin of pride, and one would not be far wrong in saying that this is the seed-root of all the thorns of sin; but it is from reasons connected with marriage that this pride mostly begins. To show what I mean, we generally find the grasping man throwing the blame on his nearest kin; the man mad after notoriety and ambition generally makes his family responsible for this sin: \"he must not be thought inferior to his forefathers; he must be deemed a great man by the generation to come by leaving his children historic records of himself\": so also the other maladies of the soul, envy, spite, hatred and such-like, are connected with this cause; they are to be found amongst those who are eager about the things of this life. He who has fled from it gazes as from some high watch-tower on the prospect of humanity, and pities these slaves of vanity for their blindness in setting such a value on bodily well-being. He sees some distinguished person giving himself airs because of his public honours, and wealth, and power, and only laughs at the folly of being so puffed up. He gives to the years of human life the longest number, according to the Psalmist's computation, and then compares this atom-interval with the endless ages, and pities the vain glory of those who excite themselves for such low and petty and perishable things. What, indeed, amongst the things here is there enviable in that which so many strive for,-honour? What is gained by those who win it? The mortal remains mortal whether he is honoured or not. What good does the possessor of many acres gain in the end? Except that the foolish man thinks his own that which never belongs to him, ignorant seemingly in his greed that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof[fn-26-P2677_1831903:18-nf] ,\" for \"God is king of all the earth[fn-26-P2678_1831972:19-nf] .\" It is the passion of having which gives men a false title of lordship over that which can never belong to them. \"The earth,\" says the wise Preacher, \"abideth for ever[fn-26-P2679_1832174:20-nf] ,\" ministering to every generation, first one, then another, that is born upon it; but men, though they are so little even their own masters, that they are brought into life without knowing it by their Maker's will, and before they wish are withdrawn from it, nevertheless in their excessive vanity think that they are her lords; that they, now born, now dying, rule that which remains continually. One who reflecting on this holds cheaply all that mankind prizes, whose only love is the divine life, because \"all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass[fn-26-P2680_1832771:21-nf] ,\" can never care for this grass which \"to-day is and to-morrow is not\"; studying the divine ways, he knows not only that human life has no fixity, but that the entire universe will not keep on its quiet course for ever; he neglects his existence here as an alien and a passing thing; for the Saviour said, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away[fn-26-P2681_1833131:22-nf] ,\" the whole of necessity awaits its refashioning. As long as he is \"in this tabernacle[fn-26-P2682_1833243:23-nf] .\" exhibiting mortality, weighed down with this existence, he laments the lengthening of his sojourn in it; as the Psalmist-poet says in his heavenly songs. Truly, they live in darkness who sojourn in these living tabernacles; wherefore that preacher, groaning at the continuance of this sojourn, says, \"Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged[fn-26-P2683_1833604:24-nf] ,\" and he attributes the cause of his dejection to \"darkness\"; for we know that darkness is called in the Hebrew language \"kedar.\" It is indeed a darkness as of the night which envelops mankind, and prevents them seeing this deceit and knowing that all which is most prized by the living, and moreover all which is the reverse, exists only in the conception of the unreflecting, and is in itself nothing; there is no such reality anywhere as obscurity of birth, or illustrious birth, or glory, or splendour, or ancient renown, or present elevation, or power over others, or subjection. Wealth and comfort, poverty and distress, and all the other inequalities of life, seem to the ignorant, applying the test of pleasure, vastly different from each other. But to the higher understanding they are all alike; one is not of greater value than the other; because life runs on to the finish with the same speed through all these opposites, and in the lots of either class there remains the same power of choice to live well or ill, \"through armour on the right hand and on the left, through evil report and good report[fn-26-P2684_1834749:25-nf] .\" Therefore the clearseeing mind which measures reality will journey on its path without turning, accomplishing its appointed time from its birth to its exit; it is neither softened by the pleasures nor beaten down by the hardships; but, as is the way with travellers, it keeps advancing always, and takes but little notice of the views presented. It is the travellers way to press on to their journey's end, no matter whether they are passing through meadows and cultivated farms, or through wilder and more rugged spots; a smiling landscape does not detain them; nor a gloomy one check their speed. So, too, that lofty mind will press straight on to its self-imposed end, not turning aside to see anything on the way. It passes through life, but its gaze is fixed on heaven; it is the good steersman directing the bark to some landmark there. But the grosser mind looks down; it bends its energies to bodily pleasures as surely as the sheep stoop to their pasture; it lives for gorging and still lower pleasures[fn-26-P2685_1835784:26-nf] ; it is alienated from the life of God[fn-26-P2686_1836001:27-nf] , and a stranger to the promise of the Covenants; it recognizes no good but the gratification of the body. It is a mind such as this that \"walks in darkness[fn-26-P2687_1836188:28-nf] ,\" and invents all the evil in this life of ours; avarice, passions unchecked, unbounded luxury, lust of power, vain-glory, the whole mob of moral diseases that invade men's homes. In these vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one has entered all the rest seem to follow, dragging each other in a natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the first link, the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the motion of the first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity through the intervening links; so firmly are men's vices linked together by their very nature; when one of them has gained the mastery of a soul, the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this accursed chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it gives him is a victim to his thirst for fame; then a desire to increase his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame; he becomes grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then this grasping after money and superiority engenders either anger with his kith and kin, or pride towards his inferiors, or envy of those above him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured temper after that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of condemnation which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain; how all follows from one cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this inseparable train of moral diseases has entered once for all into the world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the life which involves this sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who has fled out of her looks back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt rooted to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave Egypt, that is, this life that lies under water[fn-26-P2688_1838191:29-nf] , and pass, not that Red Sea, but this black and gloomy Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil bondage, and, to use the Master's words, \"the truth shall not have made us free,\" how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of this world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his existence to be chained by nature run away from this captivity? An illustration will make our meaning clearer. A winter torrent[fn-26-P2689_1838684:30-nf] , which, impetuous in itself, becomes swollen and carries down beneath its stream trees and boulders and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger to those alone who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it rages in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life has to feel its force; only he has to receive those sufferings which nature's stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must, to be true to its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves this torrent, and these \"proud waters[fn-26-P2690_1839268:31-nf] ,\" he will escape from being \"a prey to the teeth\" of this life, as the Psalm goes on to say, and, as \"a bird from the snare,\" on virtue's wings. This simile, then, of the torrent holds; human life is a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping down to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it last till the seekers are satisfied; all that is carried to them by this stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so that the present moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep far away from such a stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should neglect eternity. How can a man keep for ever anything here, be his love for it never so passionate? Which of life's most cherished objects endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty? What wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and then melt away into their opposites. Who can continue in life's prime? Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not Nature made the bloom of beauty even more shortlived than the shows of spring? For they blossom in their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after another shedding they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits the human bloom only in the spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts of age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then pass behind the veil of oblivion. Nature's inevitable changes are many; they agonize him whose love is passionate. One way of escape is open: it is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get as far away as possible from the society of this emotional and sensual world; or rather, for a man to go outside the feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live for the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this amounts to living for the spirit only, and imitating all we can the employment of the world of spirits. There they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate the Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character from the Source of all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":24,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_123_tractate_cxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. Some one, perhaps, may inquire what is signified by the division that was made of His garments into so many parts, and of the casting of lots for the coat. The raiment of the Lord Jesus Christ parted into four, symbolized His quadripartite Church, as spread abroad over the whole world, which consists of four quarters, and equally, that is to say, harmoniously, distributed over all these quarters. On which account He elsewhere says, that He will send His angels to gather His elect from the four winds:[fn-37-P3755_2069521:5-nf] and what is that, but from the four quarters of the world, east, west, north, and south? But the coat, on which lots were cast, signifies the unity of all the parts, which is contained in the bond of charity. And when the apostle is about to speak of charity, he says, \"I show you a more excellent way;\"[fn-37-P3756_2069844:6-nf] and in another place, \"To know also the love of Christ, which far excelleth knowledge;\"[fn-37-P3757_2069951:7-nf] and still further elsewhere, \"And above all these things charity which is the bond of perfectness.\"[fn-37-P3758_2070068:8-nf] If, then, charity both has a more excellent way, and far excelleth knowledge, and is enjoined above all things, it is with great propriety that the garment, by which it is signified, is represented as woven from the top.[fn-37-P3759_2070306:9-nf] And it was without seam, that its sewing might never be separated; and came into the possession of one man, because He gathereth all into one. Just as in the case of the apostles, who formed the exact number of twelve, in other words, were divisible into four parts of three each, when the question was put to all of them, Peter was the only one that answered, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;\" and to whom it was said, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-37-P3760_2070814:10-nf] as if he alone received the power of binding and loosing: seeing, then, that one so spake in behalf of all, and received the latter along with all, as if personifying the unity itself; therefore one stands for all, because there is unity in all. Whence, also, after here saying, \"woven from the top,\" he added, \"throughout.\"[fn-37-P3761_2071167:11-nf] And this also, if referred to its meaning, implies that no one is excluded from a share thereof, who is discovered to belong to the whole: from which whole, as the Greek language indicates, the Church derives her name of Catholic. And by the casting of lots, what else is commended but the grace of God? For in this way in the person of one it reached to all, since the lot satisfied them all, because the grace of God also in its unity reacheth unto all; and when the lot is cast, the award is decided, not by the merits of each individual, hut by the secret judgment of God.","title":"Tractate CXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We must after all this turn our attention to those scriptures also which forbid our belief in such a resurrection as is held by your Animalists (for I will not call them Spiritualists),[fn-98-P9874_2728553:129-nf] that it is either to be assumed as taking place now, as soon as men come to the knowledge of the truth, or else that it is accomplished immediately after their departure from this life.

I will not here largely use the support of the other Gospels, which confirm our belief by the Lord's nativity: it is sufficient to remark that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by the angel himself as the Son of God: \"The Spirit of God shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10814_3033851:359-nf] On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth will prevail. Of course, they say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate[fn-108-P10815_3034077:360-nf] what, if it had been true, would have been written. Whom was he[fn-108-P10816_3034156:361-nf] so afraid of as not plainly to declare, \"God shall come upon thee, and the Highest shall overshadow thee? \"Now, by saying \"the Spirit of God\" (although the Spirit of God is God, ) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion[fn-108-P10817_3034435:362-nf] of the whole Godhead to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of \"the Son.\" The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same as the Word. For just as, when John says, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-108-P10818_3034811:363-nf] we understand the Spirit also in the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit, and the Two are One (and the same).[fn-108-P10819_3035093:364-nf] Now John must mean One when he speaks of Him as \"having been made flesh,\" and the angel Another when he announces Him as \"about to be born,\" if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of God is not actually He whose Word He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not actually He whose Spirit He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a personal subject,[fn-108-P10820_3035989:365-nf] and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of God, although He is an actually existing thing,[fn-108-P10821_3036396:366-nf] yet He cannot be God Himself[fn-108-P10822_3036449:367-nf] (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will \"the power of the Highest\" not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing thing, as being Spirit-in the same way as the wisdom (of God) and the providence (of God) is not God: these attributes are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance. Power is incidental to the Spirit, but cannot itself be the Spirit. These things, therefore, whatsoever they are-(I mean) the Spirit of God, and the Word and the Power-having been conferred on the Virgin, that which is born of her is the Son of God. This He Himself, in those other Gospels also, testifies Himself to have been from His very boyhood: \"Wist ye not,\" says He, \"that I must be about my Father's business? \"[fn-108-P10823_3037397:368-nf] Satan likewise knew Him to be this in his temptations: \"Since Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10824_3037505:369-nf] This, accordingly, the devils also acknowledge Him to be: \"we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10825_3037637:370-nf] His \"Father\" He Himself adores.[fn-108-P10826_3037704:371-nf] When acknowledged by Peter as the \"Christ (the Son) of God,\"[fn-108-P10827_3037815:372-nf] He does not deny the relation. He exults in spirit when He says to the Father, \"I thank Thee, O Father, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent.\"[fn-108-P10828_3038004:373-nf] He, moreover, affirms also that to no man is the Father known, but to His Son;[fn-108-P10829_3038104:374-nf] and promises that, as the Son of the Father, He will confess those who confess Him, and deny those who deny Him, before His Father.[fn-108-P10830_3038269:375-nf] He also introduces a parable of the mission to the vineyard of the Son (not the Father), who was sent after so many servants,[fn-108-P10831_3038419:376-nf] and slain by the husbandmen, and avenged by the Father. He is also ignorant of the last day and hour, which is known to the Father only.[fn-108-P10832_3038582:377-nf] He awards the kingdom to His disciples, as He says it had been appointed to Himself by the Father.[fn-108-P10833_3038704:378-nf] He has power to ask, if He will, legions of angels from the Father for His help.[fn-108-P10834_3038807:379-nf] He exclaims that God had forsaken Him.[fn-108-P10835_3038869:380-nf] He commends His spirit into the hands of the Father.[fn-108-P10836_3038946:381-nf] After His resurrection He promises in a pledge to His disciples that He will send them the promise of His Father;[fn-108-P10837_3039083:382-nf] and lastly, He commands them to baptize into the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, not into a unipersonal God.[fn-108-P10838_3039221:383-nf] And indeed it is not once only, but three times, that we are immersed into the Three Persons, at each several mention of Their names.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":24,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-04","text":"5. Again, we are taught as follows by the prophet Isaiah regarding another opposing power. The prophet says, \"How is Lucifer, who used to arise in the morning, fallen from heaven! He who assailed all nations is broken and beaten to the ground. Thou indeed saidst in thy heart, I shall ascend into heaven; above the stars of heaven shall I place my throne; I shall sit upon a lofty mountain, above the lofty mountains which are towards the north; I shall ascend above the clouds; I shall be like the Most High. Now shalt thou be brought down to the lower world, and to the foundations of the earth. They who see thee shall be amazed at thee, and shall say, This is the man who harassed the whole earth, who moved kings, who made the whole world a desert, who destroyed cities, and did not unloose those who were in chains. All the kings of the nations have slept in honour, every one in his own house; but thou shalt be cast forth on the mountains, accursed with the many dead who have been pierced through with swords, and have descended to the lower world. As a garment cloned with blood, and stained, will not be clean; neither shall thou be clean, because thou hast destroyed my land and slain my people: thou shall not remain for ever, most wicked seed. Prepare thy sons for death on account of the sins of thy father, lest they rise again and inherit the earth, and fill the earth with wars. And I shall rise against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and I shall cause their name to perish, and their remains, and their seed.\"[fn-63-P6393_1196685:100-nf] Most evidently by these words is he shown to have fallen from heaven, who formerly was Lucifer, and who used to arise in the morning. For if, as some think, he was a nature of darkness, how is Lucifer said to have existed before? Or how could he arise in the morning, who had in himself nothing of the light? Nay, even the Saviour Himself teaches us, saying of the devil, \"Behold, I see Satan fallen from heaven like lightning.\"[fn-63-P6394_1197138:101-nf] For at one time he was light. Moreover our Lord, who is the truth, compared the power of His own glorious advent to lightning, in the words, \"For as the lightning shineth from the height of heaven even to its height again, so will the coming of the Son of man be.\"[fn-63-P6395_1197422:102-nf] And notwithstanding He compares him to lightning, and says that he fell from heaven, that He might show by this that he had been at one time in heaven, and had had a place among the saints, and had enjoyed a share in that light in which all the saints participate, by which they are made angels. of light, and by which the apostles are termed by the Lord the light of the world. In this manner, then, did that being once exist as light before he went astray, and fell to this place, and had his glory turned into dust, which is peculiarly the mark of the wicked, as the prophet also says; whence, too, he was called the prince of this world, i.e., of an earthly habitation: for he exercised power over those who were obedient to his wickedness, since \"the whole of this world\"-for I term this place of earth, world-\"lieth in the wicked one,\"[fn-63-P6396_1198287:103-nf] and in this apostate. That he is an apostate, i.e., a fugitive, even the Lord in the book of Job says, \"Thou wilt take with a hook the apostate dragon,\" i.e., a fugitive.[fn-63-P6397_1198479:104-nf] Now it is certain that by the dragon is understood the devil himself. If then they are called opposing powers, and are said to have been once without stain, while spotless purity exists in the essential being of none save the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but is an accidental quality in every created thing; and since that which is accidental may also fall away, and since those opposite powers once were spotless, and were once among those which still remain unstained, it is evident from all this that no one is pure either by essence or nature, and that no one was by nature polluted. And the consequence of this is, that it lies within ourselves and in our own actions to possess either happiness or holiness; or by sloth and negligence to fall from happiness into wickedness and ruin, to such a degree that, through too great proficiency, so to speak, in wickedness (if a man be guilty of so great neglect), he may descend even to that state in which he will be changed into what is called an \"opposing power.\"","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":24,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_27_sermon_x_lx_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"7.

But perhaps this question is asked, If it be the understanding which prays and sings with the spirit, and if it be the same which receives both perfection and salvation, how is it that Peter says, \"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls? \"[fn-66-P6654_1346986:132-nf] If the soul neither prays nor sings with the spirit, how shall it hope for salvation? or when it attains to blessedness, shall it be no longer called a soul?[fn-66-P6655_1347164:133-nf] Let us see if perhaps an answer may be given in this way, that as the Saviour came to save what was lost, that which formerly was said to be lost is not lost when it is saved; so also, perhaps, this which is saved is called a soul, and when it has been placed in a state of salvation will receive a name from the Word that denotes its more perfect condition. But it appears to some that this also may be added, that as the thing which was lost undoubtedly existed before it was lost, at which time it was something else than destroyed, so also will be the case when it is no longer in a ruined condition. In like manner also, the soul which is said to have perished will appear to have been something at one time, when as yet it had not perished, and on that account would be termed soul, and being again freed from destruction, it may become a second time what it was before it perished, and be called a soul. But from the very signification of the name soul which the Greek word conveys, it has appeared to a few curious inquirers that a meaning of no small importance may be suggested. For in sacred language God is called a fire, as when Scripture says,\" Our God is a consuming fire.\"[fn-66-P6656_1349244:134-nf] Respecting the substance of the angels also it speaks as follows: \"Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a burning fire; \"[fn-66-P6657_1349400:135-nf] and in another place, \"The angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire in the bush.\"[fn-66-P6658_1349521:136-nf] We have, moreover, received a commandment to be \"fervent in spirit; \"[fn-66-P6659_1349610:137-nf] by which expression undoubtedly the Word of God is shown to be hot and fiery. The prophet Jeremiah also hears from Him, who gave him his answers, \"Behold, I have given My words into thy mouth a fire.\"[fn-66-P6660_1349832:138-nf] As God, then, is a fire, and the angels a flame of fire, and all the saints are fervent in spirit, so, on the contrary, those who have fallen away from the love of God are undoubtedly said to have cooled in their affection for Him, and to have become cold. For the Lord also says, that, \"because iniquity has abounded, the love of many will grow cold.\"[fn-66-P6661_1350277:139-nf] Nay, all things, whatever they are, which in holy Scripture are compared with the hostile power, the devil is said to be perpetually finding cold; and what is found to be colder than he? In the sea also the dragon is said to reign. For the prophet[fn-66-P6662_1350548:140-nf] intimates that the serpent and dragon, which certainly is referred to one of the wicked spirits, is also in the sea. And elsewhere the prophet says, \"I will draw out my holy sword upon the dragon the flying serpent, upon the dragon the crooked serpent, and will slay him.\"[fn-66-P6663_1350853:141-nf] And again he says: \"Even though they hide from my eyes, and descend into the depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.\"[fn-66-P6664_1351030:142-nf] In the book of Job also, he is said to be the king of all things in the waters.[fn-66-P6665_1351129:143-nf] The prophet[fn-66-P6666_1351168:144-nf] threatens that evils will be kindled by the north wind upon all who inhabit the earth. Now the north wind is described in holy Scripture as cold, according to the statement in the book of Wisdom, \"That cold north wind; \"[fn-66-P6667_1351408:145-nf] which same thing also must undoubtedly be understood of the devil. If, then, those things which are holy are named fire, and light, and fervent, while those which are of an opposite nature are said to be cold; and if the love of many is said to wax cold; we have to inquire whether perhaps the name soul, which in Greek is termed yukh/, be so termed from growing cold[fn-66-P6668_1351802:146-nf] out of a betterand more divine condition, and be thence derived, because it seems to have cooled from thatnatural and divine warmth, and therefore has been placed in its present position, and called by its present name. Finally, see if you caneasily find a place in holy Scripture where thesoul is properly mentioned in terms of praise: it frequently occurs, on the contrary, accompanied with expressions of censure, as in the passage, \"An evil soul ruins him who possesses it; \"[fn-66-P6669_1352309:147-nf] and, \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\"[fn-66-P6670_1352376:148-nf] For after it has been said, \"All souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine,\"[fn-66-P6671_1352521:149-nf] it seemed to follow that He would say, \"The soul that doeth righteousness, it shall be saved,\" and \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\" But now we see that He has associated with the soul what is censurable, and has been silent as to that which was deserving of praise. We have therefore to see if, perchance, as we have said is declared by the name itself, it was called yukh/, i.e., anima, because it has waxed cold from the fervour of just things,[fn-66-P6672_1353002:150-nf] and from participation in the divine fire, and yet has not lost the power of restoring itself to that condition of fervour in which it was at the beginning. Whence the prophet also appears to point out some such state of things by the words, \"Return, O my soul, unto thy rest.\"[fn-66-P6673_1353622:151-nf] From all which this appears to be made out, that the understanding, falling away from its status and dignity, was made or named soul; and that, if repaired and corrected, it returns to the condition of the understanding.[fn-66-P6674_1353863:152-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":24,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"299","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And Trypho said, \"I believe, however, that many of those who say that they confess Jesus, and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no means injured in consequence.\" And I replied, \"The fact that there are such men confessing themselves to be Christians, and admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching His doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are disciples of the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more faithful and stedfast in the hope announced by Him. For what things He predicted would take place in His name, these we do see being actually accomplished in our sight. For he said, `Many shall come in My name, clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.'\"[fn-43-P4316_882505:88-nf] And, `There shall be schisms and heresies.'[fn-43-P4317_882569:89-nf] And, `Beware of false prophets, who shall come to you clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.'[fn-43-P4318_882722:90-nf] And, `Many false Christs and false apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful.'[fn-43-P4319_882840:91-nf] There are, therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name of Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach to blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ, who was foretold by Him as coming, and the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, with whom we have nothing in common, since we know them to be atheists, impious, unrighteous, and sinful, and confessors of Jesus in name only, instead of worshippers of Him. Yet they style themselves Christians, just as certain among the Gentiles inscribe the name of God upon the works of their own hands, and partake in nefarious and impious rites.) Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians, and some Saturnilians, and others by other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion, just as each one of those who consider themselves philosophers, as I said before, thinks he must bear the name of the philosophy which he follows, from the name of the father of the particular doctrine. So that, in consequence of these events, we know that Jesus foreknew what would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events which He foretold would befall those who believed on and confessed Him, the Christ. For all that we suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold would take place; so that it is manifest no word or act of His can be found fault with. Wherefore we pray for you and for all other men who hate us; in order that you, having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him who, by His works, by the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the words He taught, by the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the blameless, and in all things irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on Him, may be saved in His second glorious advent, and may not be condemned to fire by Him.\"","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":24,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Concerning, then, the creation of the world, *83tion of Scripture can give us more information regarding it, than the account which Moses has transmitted respecting its origin? And although it comprehends matters of pro-founder significance than the mere historical narrative appears to indicate, and contains very many things that are to be spiritually understood, and employs the letter, as a kind of veil, in treating of profound and mystical subjects; nevertheless the language of the narrator shows that all visible things were created at a certain time. But with regard to the consummation of the world, Jacob is the first who gives any information, in addressing his children in the words: \"Gather yourselves together unto me, ye sons of Jacob, that I may tell you what shall be in the last days,\" or \"after the last days.\"[fn-72-P7252_1623965:375-nf] If, then, there be \"last days,\" or a period \"succeeding the last days,\" the days which had a beginning must necessarily come to an end. David, too, declares: \"The heavens shall perish, but Thou shall endure; yea, all of them shall wax old as doth a garment: as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall be changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall have no end.\"[fn-72-P7253_1624466:376-nf] Our Lord and Saviour, indeed, in the words, \"He who made them at the beginning, made them male and female,\"[fn-72-P7254_1624598:377-nf] Himself bears witness that the world was created; and again, when He says, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My word shall not pass away,\"[fn-72-P7255_1624763:378-nf] He points out that they are perishable, and must come to an end. The apostle, moreover, in declaring that \"the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God,\"[fn-72-P7256_1625141:379-nf] manifestly announces the end of the world; as he does also when he again says, \"The fashion of this world passeth away.\"[fn-72-P7257_1625288:380-nf] Now, by the expression which he employs, \"that the creature was made subject to vanity,\" he shows that there was a beginning to this world: for if the creature were made subject to vanity on account of some hope, it was certainly made subject from a cause; and seeing it was from a cause, it must necessarily have had a beginning: for, without some beginning, the creature could not be subject to vanity, nor could that (creature) hope to be freed from the bondage of corruption, which had not begun to serve.

This point, indeed, is not to be idly passed by, that the holy Scriptures have called the creation of the world by a new and peculiar name, terming it katabolh/, which has been very improperly translated into Latin by \"constitutio; \"for in Greek katabolh/ signifies rather \"dejicere,\" i.e., to cast downwards,-a word which has been, as we have already remarked, improperly translated into Latin by the phrase \"constitutio mun-di,\" as in the Gospel according to John, where the Saviour says, \"And there will be tribulation in those days, such as was not since the beginning of the world; \"[fn-72-P7266_1629788:386-nf] in which passage katabolh/ is rendered by beginning (constitutio), which is to be understood as above explained. The apostle also, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, has employed the same language, saying, \"Who hath chosen us before the foundation of the world; \"[fn-72-P7267_1630073:387-nf] and this foundation he calls katabolh/, to be understood in the same sense as before. It seems worth while, then, to inquire what is meant by this new term; and I am, indeed, of opinion[fn-72-P7268_1630277:388-nf] that, as the end and consummation of the saints will be in those (ages) which are not seen, and are eternal, we must conclude (as frequently pointed out in the preceding pages), from a contemplation of that very end, that rational creatures had also a similar beginning. And if they had a beginning such as the end for which they hope, they existed undoubtedly from the very beginning in those (ages) which are not seen, and are eternal.[fn-72-P7269_1633366:389-nf] And if this is so, then there has been a descent from a higher to a lower condition, on the part not only of those souls who have deserved the change by the variety of their movements, but also on that of those who, in order to serve the whole world, were brought down from those higher and invisible spheres to these lower and visible ones, although against their will-\"Because the creature was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected the same in hope; \"[fn-72-P7270_1634287:390-nf] so that both sun, and moon, and stars, and angels might discharge their duty to the world, and to those souls which, on account of their excessive mental defects, stood in need of bodies of a grosser and more solid nature; and for the sake of those for whom this arrangement was necessary, this visible world was also called into being. From this it follows, that by the use of the word a descent from a higher to a lower condition, shared by all in common, would seem to be pointed out. The hope indeed of freedom is entertained by the whole of creation-of being liberated from the corruption of slavery-when the sons of God, who either fell away or were scattered abroad,[fn-72-P7271_1634992:391-nf] shall be gathered together into one, or when they shall have fulfilled their other duties in this world, which are known to God alone, the Disposer of all things. We are, indeed, to suppose that the world was created of such quality and capacity as to contain not only all those souls which it was determined should be trained in this world, but also all those powers which were prepared to attend, and serve, and assist them. For it is established by many declarations that all rational creatures are of one nature: on which ground alone could the justice of God in all His dealings with them be defended, seeing every one has the reason in himself, why he has been placed in this or that rank in life.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":24,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_38_book_iv_of_the_institutes_of_the_renunciants_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Beware therefore lest at any time you take again any of those things which you renounced and forsook, and, contrary to the Lord's command, return from the field of evangelical work, and be found to have clothed yourself again in your coat which you had stripped off;[fn-23-P2394_1014228:46-nf] neither sink back to the low and earthly lusts and desires of this world, and in defiance of Christ's word come down from the rod of perfection and dare to take up again any of those things which you have renounced and forsaken.

David also said, The wicked shall turn back to Sheol.[fn-46-P4672_1574388:36-nf] We say that to Sheol, in which Korah and his\ncompanions were swallowed up, thither shall the wicked be turned back. For God has power, if He\nchooses, to give inheritance of life in heaven, and if it please Him, in the earth. Jesus our Lord\nsaid, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.[fn-46-P4673_1574721:37-nf] And to one of those who were crucified with Him,\nwho believed on him He swore:-Thou shalt be with Me to-day in the garden Eden.[fn-46-P4674_1574865:38-nf] And the Apostle said, When the righteous shall\nrise again, they shall fly upwards to meet our Redeemer.[fn-46-P4675_1574991:39-nf] But, however, we say thus: That which our\nRedeemer said to us is true:-Heaven and earth shall pass away.[fn-46-P4676_1575118:40-nf] And the Apostle said, Hope which is seen is\nnot hope.[fn-46-P4677_1575193:41-nf] And the Prophet said, The\nheavens shall pass away as smoke, and the earth as a garment shall wear away; and its inhabitants\nshall become like it.[fn-46-P4678_1575359:42-nf] And Job said\nconcerning those that sleep, Till the heavens wear out, they shall not be aroused, nor shall they\nwake out of their sleep.[fn-46-P4679_1575511:43-nf] From these\nthings be thou persuaded that this earth, in which the children of Adam are sown, and the firmament\nthat is over men, (even) that firmament which is set to divide the upper heavens from the earth and\nthis life, shall pass away, and wear out, and be destroyed. And God will make a new thing for the\nchildren of Adam, and they shall inherit inheritances in the Kingdom of Heaven. If He shall give them\ninheritance in the earth, it shall be called the kingdom of heaven. And if in Heaven, it is easy for\nHim to do. For with the kings of the earth also, although each one of them abides in his own place,\nyet every place to which their authority extends, is called their kingdom. So the sun is a luminary\nset in the heaven, yet for every place to which its rays extend, its authority suffices, whether on\nsea or on land. And observe that the princes of the world also have banquetings and delights, and in\nevery place or state into which they go, their banquetings are with them; and in whatever place\npleases them, they make a prison-house. For the sun in twelve hours circles round, from the east unto\nthe west; and when he has accomplished his course, his light is hidden in the night-time, and the\nnight is not disturbed by his power. And in the hours of the night the sun turns round in his rapid\ncourse, and turning round begins to run in his accustomed path. As for the sun that is with thee,\nthou wise man, from thy childhood till the completion of thy old age, thou knowest not where he runs\nin the night-time, so as to circle round to the place of its course.

However, we must distinguish between the case of those who unwittingly join the ranks of these heretics, under the impression that they are entering the true Church of Christ, and those who know that there is no other Catholic Church save that which, according to the promise, is spread abroad throughout the whole world, and extends even to the utmost limits of the earth; which, rising amid tares, and seeking rest in the future from the weariness of offenses, says in the Book of Psalms, \"From the end of the earth I cried unto Thee, while my heart was in weariness: Thou didst exalt me on a rock.\"[fn-30-P3048_1792364:7-nf] But the rock was Christ, in whom the apostle says that we are now raised up, and set together in heavenly places, though not yet actually, but only in hope.[fn-30-P3049_1792562:8-nf] And so the psalm goes on to say, \"Thou wast my guide, because Thou art become my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy.\"[fn-30-P3050_1792713:9-nf] By means of His promises, which are like spears and javelins stored up in a strongly fortified place, the enemy is not only guarded against, but overthrown, as he clothes his wolves in sheep's clothing,[fn-30-P3051_1792958:10-nf] that they may say, \"Lo, here is Christ, or there;\"[fn-30-P3052_1793029:11-nf] and that they may separate many from the Catholic city which is built upon a hill, and bring them down to the isolation of their own snares, so as utterly to destroy them. And these men, knowing this, choose to receive the baptism of Christ without the limits of the communion of the unity of Christ's body, though they intend afterwards, with the sacrament which they have received elsewhere, to pass into that very communion. For they propose to receive Christ's baptism in antagonism to the Church of Christ, well knowing that it is so even on the very day on which they receive it. And if this is a sin, who is the man that will say, Grant that for a single day I may commit sin? For if he proposes to pass over to the Catholic Church, I would fain ask why. What other answer can he give, but that it is ill to belong to the party of Donatus, and not to the unity of the Catholic Church? Just so many days, then, as you commit this ill, of so many days' sin are you going to be guilty. And it may be said that there is greater sin in more days' commission of it, and less in fewer; but in no wise can it be said that no sin is committed at all. But what is the need of allowing this accursed wrong for a single day, or a single hour? For the man who wishes this license to be granted him, might as well ask of the Church, or of God Himself, that for a single day he should be permitted to apostatize. For there is no reason why he should fear to be an apostate for a day, if he does not shrink from being for that time a schismatic or a heretic.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"ANF-04","text":"This Jew of Celsus continues, after the above, in the following fashion: \"Although he could state many things regarding the events of the life of Jesus which are true, and not like those which are recorded by the disciples, he willingly omits them.\" What, then, are those true statements, unlike the accounts in the Gospels, which the Jew of Celsus passes by without mention? Or is he only employing what appears to be a figure of speech,[fn-80-P8085_1985022:48-nf] in pretending to have something to say, while in reality he had nothing to produce beyond the Gospel narrative which could impress the hearer with a feeling of its truth, and furnish a clear ground of accusation against Jesus and His doctrine? And he charges the disciples with having invented the statement that Jesus foreknew and foretold all that happened to Him; but the truth of this statement we shall establish, although Celsus may not like it, by means of many other predictions uttered by the Saviour, in which He foretold what would befall the Christians in after generations. And who is there who would not be astonished at this prediction: \"Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles; \"[fn-80-P8086_1985817:49-nf] and at any others which He may have delivered respecting the future persecution of His disciples? For what system of opinions ever existed among men on account of which others are punished, so that any one of the accusers of Jesus could say that, foreseeing the impiety or falsity of his opinions to be the ground of an accusation against them he thought that this would redound to his credit, that he had so predicted regarding it long before? Now if any deserve to be brought, on account of their opinions, before governors and kings, what others are they, save the Epicureans, who altogether deny the existence of providence? And also the Peripatetics, who say that prayers are of no avail, and sacrifices offered as to the Divinity? But some one will say that the Samaritans suffer persecution because of their religion. In answer to whom we shall state that the Sicarians,[fn-80-P8087_1986713:50-nf] on account of the practice of circumcision, as mutilating themselves contrary to the established laws and the customs permitted to the Jews alone, are put to death. And you never hear a judge inquiring whether a Sicarian who strives to live according to this established religion of his will be released from punishment if he apostatizes, but will be led away to death if he continues firm; for the evidence of the circumcision is sufficient to ensure the death of him who has undergone it. But Christians alone, according to the prediction of their Saviour, \"Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake,\" are urged up to their last breath by their judges to deny Christianity, and to sacrifice according to the public customs; and after the oath of abjuration, to return to their homes, and to live in safety. And observe whether it is not with great authority that this declaration is uttered: \"Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father who is in heaven. And whosoever shall deny Me before men,\"[fn-80-P8088_1987989:51-nf] etc. And go back with me in thought to Jesus when He uttered these words, and see His predictions not yet accomplished. Perhaps you will say, in a spirit of incredulity, that he is talking folly, and speaking to no purpose, for his words will have no fulfilment; or, being in doubt about assenting to his words, you will say, that if these predictions be fulfilled, and the doctrine of Jesus be established, so that governors and kings think of destroying those who acknowledge Jesus, then we shall believe that he utters these prophecies as one who has received great power from God to implant this doctrine among the human race, and as believing that it will prevail. And who will not be filled with wonder, when he goes back in thought to Him who then taught and said, \"This Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles,\"[fn-80-P8089_1988886:52-nf] and beholds, agreeably to His words, the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached in the whole world under heaven to Greeks and Barbarians, wise and foolish alike? For the word, spoken with power, has gained the mastery over men of all sorts of nature, and it is impossible to see any race of men which has escaped accepting the teaching of Jesus. But let this Jew of Celsus, who does not believe that He foreknew all that happened to Him, consider how, while Jerusalem was still standing, and the whole Jewish worship celebrated in it, Jesus foretold what would befall it from the hand of the Romans. For they will not maintain that the acquaintances and pupils of Jesus Himself handed down His teaching contained in the Gospels without committing it to writing, and left His disciples without the memoirs of Jesus contained in their works.[fn-80-P8090_1989740:53-nf] Now in these it is recorded, that \"when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed about with armies, then shall ye know that the desolation thereof is nigh.\"[fn-80-P8091_1990396:54-nf] But at that time there were no armies around Jerusalem, encompassing and enclosing and besieging it; for the siege began in the reign of Nero, and lasted till the government of Vespasian, whose son Titus destroyed Jerusalem, on account, as Josephus says, of James the Just, the brother of Jesus who was called Christ, but in reality, as the truth makes dear, on account of Jesus Christ the Son of God.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":24,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":50,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Jesus, accordingly, in turning away the minds of His disciples, not merely from giving heed to sorcerers in general, and those who profess in any other manner to work miracles-for His disciples did not need to be so warned-but from such as gave themselves out as the Christ of God, and who tried by certain apparent[fn-82-P8259_2057034:111-nf] miracles to gain over to them the disciples of Jesus, said in a certain passage: \"Then, if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore, if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth; behold, he is in the secret chambers, believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even to the west, so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.\"[fn-82-P8260_2057676:112-nf] And in another passage: \"Many will say unto Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and drunk in Thy name, and by Thy name have cast out demons, and done many wonderful works? And then will I say unto them, Depart from Me, because ye are workers of iniquity.\"[fn-82-P8261_2057968:113-nf] But Celsus, wishing to assimilate the miracles of Jesus to the works of human sorcery, says in express terms as follows: \"O light and truth! he distinctly declares, with his own voice, as ye yourselves have recorded, that there will come to you even others, employing miracles of a similar kind, who are wicked men, and sorcerers; and he calls him who makes use of such devices, one Satan. So that Jesus himself does not deny that these works at least are not at all divine, but are the acts of wicked men; and being compelled by the force of truth, he at the same time not only laid open the doings of others, but convicted himself of the same acts. Is it not, then, a miserable inference, to conclude from the same works that the one is God and the other sorcerers? Why ought the others, because of these acts, to be accounted wicked rather than this man, seeing they have him as their witness against himself? For he has himself acknowledged that these are not the works of a divine nature, but the inventions of certain deceivers, and of thoroughly wicked men.\" Observe, now, whether Celsus is not clearly convicted of slandering the Gospel by such statements, since what Jesus says regarding those who are to work signs and wonders is different from what this Jew of Celsus alleges it to be. For if Jesus had simply told His disciples to be on their guard against those who professed to work miracles, without declaring what they would give themselves out to be, then perhaps there would have been some ground for his suspicion. But since those against whom Jesus would have us to be on our guard give themselves out as the Christ-which is not a claim put forth by sorcerers-and since He says that even some who lead wicked lives will perform miracles in the name of Jesus, and expel demons out of men, sorcery in the case of these individuals, or any suspicion of such, is rather, if we may so speak, altogether banished, and the divinity of Christ established, as well as the divine mission[fn-82-P8262_2060020:114-nf] of His disciples; seeing that it is possible that one who makes use of His name, and who is wrought upon by some power, in some way unknown, to make the pretence that he is the Christ, should seem to perform miracles like those of Jesus, while others through His name should do works resembling those of His genuine disciples.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":24,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_48_oration_xxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"II.

First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first \"gift\" is that which is concerned with the remission of sins; by which blessing \"we are delivered from the power of darkness;\"[fn-39-P3958_1709098:72-nf] and the prince of this world,[fn-39-P3959_1709145:73-nf] who worketh in the children of disobedience\"[fn-39-P3960_1709209:74-nf] by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of sin, is \"cast out\" by our faith.

In the beginning, therefore, did God form Adam, not as if He stood in need of man, but that He might have [some one] upon whom to confer His benefits.

For to follow the Saviour is to be a partaker of salvation, and to follow light is to receive light. But those who are in light do not themselves illumine the light, but are illumined and revealed by it: they do certainly contribute nothing to it, but, receiving the benefit, they are illumined by the light. Thus, also, service [rendered] to God does indeed profit God nothing, nor has God need of human obedience; but He grants to those who follow and serve Him life and in-corruption and eternal glory, bestowing benefit upon those who serve [Him], because they do serve Him, and on His followers, because they do follow Him; but does not receive any benefit from them: for He is rich, perfect, and in need of nothing. But for this reason does God demand service from men, in order that, since He is good and merciful, He may benefit those who continue in His service. For, as much as God is in want of nothing, so much does man stand in need of fellowship with God. For this is the glory of man, to continue and remain permanently in God's service.

And, in the next place, since evil is specially characterized by its diffusion, and attains its greatest height when it simulates the appearance of the good, for that reason are signs, and marvels, and lying miracles found to accompany evil, through the co-operation of its father the devil. For, far surpassing the help which these demons give to jugglers (who deceive men for the basest of purposes), is the aid which the devil himself affords in order to deceive the human race.

Those nations however, who did not of themselves raise up their eyes unto heaven, nor returned thanks to their Maker, nor wished to behold the light of truth, but who were like blind mice concealed in the depths of ignorance, the word justly reckons \"as waste water from a sink, and as the turning-weight of a balance-in fact, as nothing; \"[fn-92-P9299_2716929:250-nf] so far useful and serviceable to the just, as stubble conduces towards the growth of the wheat, and its straw, by means of combustion, serves for working gold.

And we can clearly see that the same system holds good in that most fruitful garden of the Scriptures of the Spirit, in which some things shine forth clear and bright in their literal sense, in such a way that while they have no need of any higher interpretation, they furnish abundant food and nourishment in the simple sound of the words, to the hearers: as in this passage: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord;\" and: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.\"[fn-46-P4631_1685849:4-nf] But there are some which, unless they are weakened down by an allegorical interpretation, and softened by the trial of the fire of the spirit cannot become wholesome food for the inner man without injury and loss to him; and damage rather than profit will accrue to him from receiving them: as with this passage: \"But let your loins be girded up and your lights burning;\" and: \"whosoever has no sword, let him sell his coat and buy himself a sword;\" and: \"whosoever taketh not up his cross and followeth after Me is not worthy of Me;\"[fn-46-P4632_1686410:5-nf] a passage which some most earnest monks, having \"indeed a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge\"[fn-46-P4633_1686538:6-nf] understood literally, and so made themselves wooden crosses, and carried them about constantly on their shoulders, and so were the cause not of edification but of ridicule on the part of all who saw them. But some are capable of being taken suitable and properly in both ways, i.e., the historical and allegorical, so that either explanation furnishes a healing draught to the soul; as this passage: \"If any one shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also;\" and: \"when they persecute you in one city, flee to another;\" and: \"if thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me.\"[fn-46-P4634_1687276:7-nf] It produces indeed \"grass for the cattle\" also, (and of this food all the fields of Scripture are full); viz., plain and simple narratives of history, by which simple folk, and those who are incapable of perfect and sound understanding (of whom it is said \"Thou, Lord, wilt save both man and beast\")[fn-46-P4635_1687591:8-nf] may be made stronger and more vigorous for their hard work and the labour of actual life, in accordance with the state and measure of their capacity.

See, they say, in Christian times it is that Rome perishes. Perhaps Rome is not perishing; perhaps she is only scourged, not utterly destroyed; perhaps she is chastened, not brought to nought. It may be so; Rome will not perish, if the Romans do not perish. And perish they will not if they praise God; perish they will if they blaspheme Him. For what is Rome, but the Romans? For the question is not of her wood and stones, of her lofty insulated[fn-44-P4421_1880446:33-nf] palaces, and all her spacious walls. All this was made only on this condition that it should fall some other day. When man built it, he laid stone on stone; and when man destroyed it, he removed stone from stone. Man made it, man destroyed it. Is any injury done to Rome, because it is said, \"She is falling\"? No, not to Rome, but to her builder perhaps. Do we then its builder any injury, because we say, Rome is falling, which Romulus built? This world itself will be burnt with fire, which God built. But neither does what man has made fall to ruin, except when God wills it; nor what God has made, except when He wills. For if the work of man fall not without God's will, how can God's work fall by the will of man? Yet God both made the world that was one day to fall for thee; and therefore made He thee as one who was one day to die. Man himself, the city's ornament, man himself, the city's inhabitant, ruler, governor, comes on this condition that he may go, is born on this condition that he may die, entered into the world on this condition that he may pass away; \"Heaven and earth shall pass away:\"[fn-44-P4422_1881572:34-nf] what wonder then if some time or other there should be an end of a single city? And yet peradventure the city's end is not come now; yet some time or other come it will. But why does Rome perish amid the sacrifices of Christians? Why was her mother Troy burnt amid the sacrifices of Heathens? The gods in whom the Romans have placed all their hope, yea the Roman gods in whom the Heathen Romans placed their hope, removed from the flames of Troy to found Rome. These very gods of Rome were originally the gods of Troy. Troy was burnt, and Aeneas took the fugitive gods; yea rather himself a fugitive he took away these senseless gods. For they could be carried by the fugitive; but they could not flee away themselves. And coming with these gods into Italy, with these false gods, he founded Rome. It is too long to go through the whole story; yet would I briefly mention what their own writings contain. An author of theirs well known to all speaks thus; \"As I have received the account, the Trojans who under the guidance of Aeneas were wandering about as fugitives without any settled abode, originally built and inhabited Rome.\"[fn-44-P4423_1882725:35-nf] So they had their gods with them, they builded Rome in Latium, and there they placed the gods to be worshipped, which before were worshipped in Troy. Juno is introduced by their poet, incensed against Aeneas and the fugitive Trojans, saying,","title":"Sermon XXXI. [LXXXI.

For the New Testament arose out of the Old, and bears witness to the Old; if then they reject this, how can they receive what proceeds from it? Thus Paul was an Apostle of the Gospel, `which God promised afore by His prophets in the holy Scriptures[fn-39-P3939_1655212:21-nf] :' and our Lord Himself said, `ye search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me[fn-39-P3940_1655323:22-nf] .' How then shall they confess the Lord unless they first search the Scriptures which are written concerning Him? And the disciples say that they have found Him, `of whom Moses and the Prophets did write[fn-39-P3941_1655544:23-nf] .' And what is the Law to the Sadducees if they receive not the Prophets[fn-39-P3942_1655634:24-nf] ? For God who gave the Law, Himself promised in the Law that He would raise up Prophets also, so that the same is Lord both of the Law and of the Prophets, and he that denies the one must of necessity deny the other also. And again, what is the Old Testament to the Jews, unless they acknowledge the Lord whose coming was expected according to it? For had they believed the writings of Moses, they would have believed the words of the Lord; for He said, `He wrote of Me[fn-39-P3943_1656165:25-nf] .' Moreover, what are the Scriptures to him[fn-39-P3944_1656226:26-nf] of Samosata, who denies the Word of God and His incarnate Presence[fn-39-P3945_1656330:27-nf] , which is signified and declared both in the Old and New Testament? And of what use are the Scriptures to the Arians also, and why do they bring them forward, men who say that the Word of God is a creature, and like the Gentiles `serve the creature more than' God `the Creator[fn-39-P3946_1656629:28-nf] ?' Thus each of these heresies, in respect of the peculiar impiety of its invention, has nothing in common with the Scriptures. And their advocates are aware of this, that the Scriptures are very much, or rather altogether, opposed to the doctrines of every one of them; but for the sake of deceiving the more simple sort (such as are those of whom it is written in the Proverbs, `The simple believeth every word[fn-39-P3947_1657059:29-nf] ),' they pretend like their `father the devil[fn-39-P3948_1657125:30-nf] ' to study and to quote the language of Scripture, in order that they may appear by their words to have a right belief, and so may persuade their wretched followers to believe what is contrary to the Scriptures. Assuredly in every one of these heresies the devil has thus disguised himself, and has suggested to them words full of craftiness. The Lord spake concerning them, that `there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, so that they shall deceive many[fn-39-P3949_1657610:31-nf] .' Accordingly the devil has come, speaking by each and saying, `I am Christ, and the truth is with me;' and he has made them, one and all, to be liars like himself. And strange it is, that while all heresies are at variance with one another concerning the mischievous inventions which each has framed, they are united together only by the common purpose of lying[fn-39-P3950_1657995:32-nf] . For they have one and the same father that has sown in them all the seeds, of falsehood. Wherefore the faithful Christian and true disciple of the Gospel, having grace to discern spiritual things, and having built the house of his faith upon a rock, stands continually firm and secure from their deceits. But the simple person, as I said before, that is not thoroughly grounded in knowledge, such an one, considering only the words that are spoken and not perceiving their meaning, is immediately drawn away by their wiles. Wherefore it is good and needful for us to pray that we may receive the gift of discerning spirits, so that every one may know, according to the precept of John, whom he ought to reject, and whom to receive as friends and of the same faith. Now one might write at great length concerning these things, if one desired to go rate details respecting them; for the impiety and perverseness of heresies will appear to be manifold and various, and the craft of the deceivers to be very terrible. But since holy Scripture is of all things most sufficient[fn-39-P3951_1659094:33-nf] for us, therefore recommending to those who desire to know more of these matters, to read the Divine word, I now hasten to set before you that which most claims attention, and for the sake of which principally I have written these things.","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":24,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_18_part_ii_dogmatical_and_historical_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-05","text":"62.

For no uniform crown of perfection can be offered to all men, because all have not the same virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and different measures of perfection itself. And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For though they are called blessed, whose is the kingdom of heaven, and blessed are they who shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed are they who shall be filled, yet we believe that there is a great difference between the habitations of the kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and also between the reception of consolation and the fulness and satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. \"For there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-51-P5193_1875211:36-nf] While therefore in accordance with this rule holy Scripture praises those who fear God, and says \"Blessed are all they that fear the Lord,\"[fn-51-P5194_1875375:37-nf] and promises them for this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: \"There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment.

The previous order of our discourse had brought us to the exposition of the system of spiritual gifts, which we have learnt from the tradition of the Elders is a threefold one. The first indeed is for the sake of healing, when the grace of signs accompanies certain elect and righteous men on account of the merits of their holiness, as it is clear that the apostles and many of the saints wrought signs and wonders in accordance with the authority of the Lord Who says: \"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\"[fn-55-P5597_1999267:1-nf] The second when for the edification of the church or on account of the faith of those who bring their sick, or of those whoare to be cured, the virtue of health proceeds even from sinners and men unworthy of it. Of whom the Saviour says in the gospel: \"Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils, and in Thy name done many mighty works? And then I will confess to them, I never knew you: Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity.\"[fn-55-P5598_1999785:2-nf] And on the other hand, if the faith of those who bring them or of the sick is wanting, it prevents those onwhom the gifts of healing are conferred from exercising their powers of healing. On which subject Luke the Evangelist says: \"And Jesus could not there do any mighty work because of their unbelief.\"[fn-55-P5599_2000115:3-nf] Whence also the Lord Himself says:\"Many lepers were in Israel in the days of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.\"[fn-56-P5600_2000287:4-nf] The third method of healing is copied by the deceit and contrivance of devils, that, when a man who is enslaved to evident sins is out of admiration for his miracles regarded as a saint and a servant of God, men may be persuaded to copy his sins and thus an opening being made for cavilling, the sanctity of religion may be brought into disgrace, or else that he, who believes that he possesses the gift of healing, may be puffed up by pride of heart and so fall more grievously. Hence it is that invoking the names of those, who, as they know, have no merits of holiness or any spiritual fruits, they pretend that by their merits they are disturbed and made to flee from the bodies they have possessed. Of which it says in Deuteronomy: \"If there rise up in the midst of thee a prophet, or one who says that he has seen a dream, and declare a sign and a wonder, and that which he hath spoken cometh to pass, and he say to thee: Let us go and follow after other gods whom thou knowest not, and let us serve them: thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or of that dreamer, for the Lord thy God is tempting thee that it may appear whether thou lovest Him or not, with all thy heart and with all thy soul.\"[fn-56-P5601_2001517:5-nf] And in the gospel it says: \"There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great signs and wonders, so that, if it were possible, even the elect should be led astray.\"[fn-56-P5602_2001725:6-nf] ","title":"XV.

What is it then, Brethren? Let us treat now of the five wise and the five foolish virgins. They wished to go to meet the Bridegroom. What is the meaning of \"to go and meet the Bridegroom\"? To go with the heart, to bewaiting for his coming. But he tarried. \"While he tarries, they all slept.\" What is \"all\"? Both the foolish and the wise, \"all slumbered and slept.\" Think we is this sleep good? What is this sleep? Is it that at the tarrying of the Bridegroom, \"because iniquity aboundeth, the love of many waxeth cold\"? Are we to understand this sleep so? I like it not. I will tell you why. Because among them are the wise virgins; and certainly when the Lord said, \"Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold;\" He went on to say, \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\"[fn-49-P4984_2129326:14-nf] Where would ye have those wise virgins be? Are they not among those that \"shall endure unto the end\"? They would not be admitted within at all, Brethren, for any other reason, than because they have \"endured unto the end.\" No coldness of love then crept over them, in them love did not wax cold; but preserves its glow even unto the end. And because it glows even unto the end, therefore are the gates of the Bridegroom opened to them; therefore are they told to enter in, as that excellent servant, \"Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"[fn-49-P4985_2129890:15-nf] What then is the meaning of they \"all slept\"?[fn-49-P4986_2129956:16-nf] There is another sleep which no one escapes.

For, notwithstanding iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxes cold, and the waves do swell, the darkness grows and the wind rages, yet the ship is moving forward; \"for he that perseveres to the end, the same shall be saved.\"[fn-12-P1229_769900:8-nf] Nor is that number of furlongs to be lightly regarded. For it cannot really be that nothing is meant, when it is said that, \"when they had rowed twenty-five or thirty furlongs, Jesus came to them.\" It were enough to say, \"twenty-five,\" so likewise \"thirty;\" especially as it was an estimate, not an assertion of the narrator. Could the truth be aught endangered by a mere estimate, if he had said nearly thirty furlongs, or nearly twenty-five furlongs? But from twenty-five he made thirty. Let us examine the number twenty-five. Of what does it consist? of what is it made up? Of the quinary, or number five. That number five pertains to the law. The same are the five books of Moses, the same are those five porches containing the sick folk, the same are the five loaves feeding the five thousand men. Accordingly the number twenty-five signifies the law, because five by five-that is, five times five-make twenty-five, or the number five squared. But this law lacked perfection before the gospel came. Moreover, perfection is comprised in the number six. Therefore in six days God finished, or perfected, the world, and the same five are multiplied by six, that the law may be completed by the gospel, that six times five become thirty. To them that fulfill the law, therefore. Jesus comes. And how does He come? Walking upon the waves, keeping all the swellings of the world under His feet, pressing down all its heights. Thus it goes on, so long as time endures, so long as the ages roll. Tribulations increase, calamities increase, sorrows increase, all these swell and mount up: Jesus passeth on treading upon the waves.","title":"Tractate XXV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_32_tractate_xxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"12.

He abode even to temptation, abode even to tyrannical questioning, abode even to bitterest threatening, abode even to destruction;-that were a trifle, abode even to savage torture. For he was not put to death quickly, but tormented in the fire: he was allowed to live a long time; nay, not allowed to live a long time, but forced to die a slow, lingering death. Then, in that lingering death, in those torments, because he had well eaten and well drunk, as one who had feasted on that meat, as one intoxicated with that cup, he felt not the torments. For He was there who said, \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth.\" For the flesh indeed was burning, but the Spirit was quickening the soul. He shrunk not back, and he mounted into the kingdom. But the holy martyr Xystus, whose day we celebrated five days ago, had said to him, \"Mourn not, my son;\" for Xystus was a bishop, he was a deacon. \"Mourn not,\" said he; \"thou shall follow me after three days.\" He said three days, meaning the interval between the day of Saint Xystus's suffering and that of Saint Laurence's suffering, which falls on to-day. Three days is the interval. What comfort! He says not, \"Mourn not, my son; the persecution will cease, and thou wilt be safe;\" but, \"do not mourn: whither I precede thou shall follow; nor shall thy pursuit be deferred: three days will be the interval, and thou shall be with me.\" He accepted the oracle, vanquished the devil, and attained to the triumph.","title":"Tractate XXVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"54.

And again, hearing from the Saviour the events of the end, they desired to learn the time of it, that they might be kept from error themselves, and might be able to teach others; as, for instance, when they had learned, they set right the Thessalonians[fn-56-P5682_2254367:325-nf] , who were going wrong.

When then the Lord appeared in the midst of His disciples when the doors were shut, and wished to make clear to the Apostles the reality of His body, when the Apostle Thomas felt His flesh and handled His side and examined His wounds-what was it that he declared, when he was convinced of the reality of the body shown to him? \"My Lord,\" he said, \"and my God.\"[fn-70-P7059_2563627:26-nf] Did he say what you say, that it was a man and not God? Christ and not Divinity? He surely touched the body of his Lord and answered that He was God. Did he make any separation between man and God? or did he call that flesh Theotocos, to use your expression, i.e., that which received Divinity? or did he, after the fashion of your blasphemy, declare that He whom he touched was to be honoured not for His own sake, but for the sake of Him whom He had received into Himself? But perhaps God's Apostle knew nothing of that subtle separation of yours, and had no experience of the fine distinctions of your judgment, as he was a rude countryman, ignorant of the dialectic art, and of the method of philosophic disputation; for whom the Lord's teaching was amply sufficient, and as he was one who knew nothing whatever except what he learnt from the instruction of the Lord! And so his words contain heavenly doctrine; his faith is a Divine lesson. He had never learnt to separate, as you do, the Lord from His body: and had no idea how to rend God asunder from Himself. He was holy, straightforward, upright: filled with practical innocence, unalloyed faith, and pure knowledge: having a simple understanding joined with prudence, a wisdom entirely free from all evil, together with perfect simplicity: ignorant of any corruption, and free from all heretical perversity, and as one who had experienced in himself the force of the Divine lesson, he held fast everything which he had learnt. And so he-countryman and ignorant fellow as you fancy him-shuts you up with a brief answer, and destroys your position with a few words of his. What then did the Apostle Thomas touch when he drew near to handle his God? Certainly it was Christ without any doubt. But what did he exclaim? \"My Lord,\" he said, \"and my God.\" Now, if you can, separate Christ from God, and change this Saying, if you are able to. Make use of all dialectic art-all the prudence of this world, and that foolish wisdom which consists in wordy subtlety. Turn yourself about in every direction, and draw in your horns. Do whatever you can with ingenuity and art. Say what you like, and do what you like; you cannot possibly get out of this without confessing that what the Apostle touched was God. And indeed, if the thing can, possibly be done, perhaps you will want to alter the statement of the gospel story, so that we may not read that the Apostle Thomas touched the body of the Lord, or that he called Christ Lord and God. But it is absolutely impossible to alter what is written in the gospel of God. For \"heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words\" of God \"shall not pass away.\"[fn-70-P7060_2566305:27-nf] For lo, even now he who then bore his witness, the Apostle Thomas, proclaims to you: \"Jesus whom I touched is God. It is God whose limbs I handled. I did not feel what was incorporeal, not handle what was intangible: I touched not a Spirit with my hand, so that it might be believed that I said of it alone `It is God.' For `a spirit,' as my Lord Himself said, `hath not flesh and bones.'[fn-70-P7061_2566718:28-nf] I touched the body of my Lord. I handled flesh and bones. I put my fingers into the prints of the wounds: and I declared of Christ my Lord, whom I had handled: 'My Lord and my God.' For I know not how to make a separation between Christ and God, and I cannot insert blasphemous distinctions between Jesus and God, or rend my Lord asunder from Himself. Away from me, whoever is of a different opinion, and whoever says anything different. I know not that Christ is other than God. This faith I held together with my fellow apostles: this I delivered to the Churches: this I preached to the Gentiles: this I proclaim to thee also, Christ is God, Christ is God.

Shall we say that one is doing greater works than all that Christ did who is working out his own salvation with fear and trembling?[fn-27-P2722_1591213:8-nf] A work which Christ is certainly working in him, but not without him; and one which I might, without hesitation, call greater than the heavens and the earth, and all in both within the compass of our vision. For both heaven and earth shall pass away,[fn-27-P2723_1591481:9-nf] but the salvation and justification of those predestinated thereto, that is, of those whom He foreknoweth, shall continue forever. In the former there is only the working of God, but in the latter there is also His image. But there are also in the heavens, thrones, governments, principalities, powers, archangels, and angels, which are all of them the work of Christ; and is it, then, greater works also than these that he doeth, who, with Christ working in him, is a co-worker in his own eternal salvation and justification? I dare not call for any hurried decision on such a point: let him who can, understand, and let him who can, judge whether it is a greater work to create righteous beings than to make righteous the ungodly. For at least, if there is equal power employed in both, there is greater mercy in the latter, For \"this is the great mystery of godliness which was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\"[fn-27-P2724_1592528:10-nf] But when He said, \"Greater works than these shall he do,\" there is no necessity requiring us to suppose that all of Christ's works are to be understood. For He spake, perhaps, only of these He was now doing; and the work He was doing at that time was uttering the words of faith, and of such works specially had He spoken just before when He said, \"The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself: but the Father, that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works.\" His words, accordingly, were Hisworks. And it is assuredly something less to preach the words of righteousness, which He did apart from us, than to justify the ungodly, which He does in such a way in us that we also are doing it ourselves. It remains for us to inquire how the words are to be understood, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it.\" Because of the many things His believing ones ask, and receive not, there is no small question claiming our attention; but as this discourse must now be concluded, we must allow at least a little delay for its consideration and discussion.","title":"Tractate LXXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":24,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-06","text":"35. These things, moreover. he has said with the view of showing us that all others who may come alter him will be false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed, like an angel of light. What great thing therefore is it, if his ministers also be transformed into the ministers of righteousness?-whose end shall be according to their works.[fn-36-P3621_1005288:348-nf] He indicates, further, what manner of men these were, and points out by whom they were being circumvented. And when the Galatians are minded to turn away from the Gospel, he says to them: \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would turn you away[fn-36-P3622_1005837:349-nf] from the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which has been delivered to you, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3623_1006023:350-nf] And again he says: \"To me, who am the least of all the apostles,[fn-36-P3624_1006108:351-nf] is this grace given; \"[fn-36-P3625_1006165:352-nf] and,\" I fill up that which was behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-36-P3626_1006266:353-nf] And once more, in another place, he declares of himself that he was a minister of Christ more than all others,[fn-36-P3627_1006396:354-nf] as though after him none other was to be looked for at all; for he enjoins that not even an angel from heaven is thus to be received. And how, then, shall we credit the professions of this Manes, who comes from Persis,[fn-36-P3628_1006637:355-nf] and declares himself to be the Paraclete? By this very thing, indeed, I rather recognise in him one of those men who transform themselves, and of whom the Apostle Paul, that elect vessel, has given us very clear indication when he says: \"Now in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; for-bidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received[fn-36-P3629_1007318:356-nf] with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-36-P3630_1007567:357-nf] The Spirit in the evangelist Matthew is also careful to give note of these words of our Lord Jesus Christ: \"Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. But if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false apostles,[fn-36-P3631_1007948:358-nf] and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. If they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: if they shall say, Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.\"[fn-36-P3632_1008388:359-nf] And yet, after all these directions, this man, who has neither sign nor portent of any kind to show, who has no affinity to exhibit, who never even had a place among the number of the disciples, who never was a follower of our departed Lord, in whose inheritance we rejoice,-this man, I say, although he never stood by our Lord in His weakness, and although he never came forward as a witness of His testament, yea rather, although he never came even within the acquaintance of those who ministered to Him in His sickness, and, in fine, although he obtains the testimony of no person whatsoever, desires us to believe this profession which he makes of being the Paraclete; whereas, even were you to do signs and wonders, we would still have to reckon you a false Christ, and a false prophet, according to the Scriptures. And therefore it is well for us to act with the greater caution, in accordance with the warning which the sainted apostle gives us, when, in the epistle which he wrote to the Colossians, he speaks in the following terms: \"Continue in the faith grounded and rooted,[fn-36-P3633_1009506:360-nf] and not to be moved away[fn-36-P3634_1009548:361-nf] from the hope of the Gospel, which we have heard,[fn-36-P3635_1009616:362-nf] and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.\"[fn-36-P3636_1009699:363-nf] And again: \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him; rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any one spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead.\"[fn-36-P3637_1010095:364-nf] And after all these matters have been thus carefully set forth, the blessed apostle, like a father speaking to his children, adds the following words, which serve as a sort of seal to his testament: \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,[fn-36-P3638_1010371:365-nf] I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\"[fn-36-P3639_1010695:366-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":24,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-06","text":"36.

Yea, even although you were to work signs and wonders, although you were to raise the dead, although you were to present to us the very image of Paul himself, you would remain accursed still.[fn-36-P3643_1011265:369-nf] For we have been instructed beforehand with regard to you: we have been both warned and armed against you by the Holy Scriptures.

And so it is that your king, Antichrist, has despatched you in a similar character, and as it were destined to death, to us who are a people placed under the administration of the good and holy King. And this I do not say inconsiderately or without due inquiry; but from the fact that I see you perform no miracle, I hold myself entitled to entertain such sentiments concerning you. For we are given to understand beforehand that the devil himself is to be transformed into an angel of light, and that his servants are to make their appearance in similar guise, and that they are to work signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, the very elect should be deceived.[fn-36-P3645_1012986:371-nf] But who, pray, are you then, to whose lot no such position of kinship has been assigned by your father Satan?[fn-36-P3646_1013119:372-nf] For whom have you raised from the dead? What issue of blood do you ever staunch? What[fn-36-P3647_1013406:373-nf] eyes of the blind do you ever anoint with clay, and thus cause them to have vision? When do you ever refresh a hungering multitude with a few loaves? Where do you ever walk upon the water, or who of those who dwell in Jerusalem has ever seen you? O Persian barbarian, you have never been able to have a knowledge of the language of the Greeks, or of the Egyptians, or of the Romans, or of any other nation; but the Chaldean tongue alone has been known to you, which verily is not a language prevalent among any great number of people,[fn-36-P3648_1014009:374-nf] and you are not capable of understanding any one of another nationality when he speaks. Not thus is it with the Holy Spirit: God forbid; but He divides to all, and knows all kinds of tongues, and has understanding of all things, and is made all things to all men, so that the very thoughts of the heart cannot escape His cognizance.

Is it not accordant with all that is fitting, that you should multiply yourself like the tares, until that same mighty father of yours comes, raising the dead, as he will profess to do, and persecuting almost to hell itself all those who refuse to yield to his bidding, keeping multitudes in check by that terror of arrogance in which he entrenches himself, and employing threatenings against others, and making sport of them by the changing of his countenance and his deceitful dealing?[fn-36-P3654_1016238:380-nf] And yet beyond that he shall proceed no further; for his folly shall be made manifest to all men, as was the case with Jamnes and Mambres.[fn-36-P3655_1016922:381-nf] The judges said: As we have heard now from you, as Paul himself also seems to tell us, and, further, as we have learned likewise from the earlier account given in the Gospel, an introduction to preaching, or teaching, or evangelizing, or prophesying, is not, in this life at least, held out on the same terms to any person in times subsequent to the apostle's:[fn-36-P3656_1017308:382-nf] and if the opposite appears ever to be the case, the person can only be held to be a false prophet or a false Christ. Now, since yon have alleged that the Paraclete was in Paul, and that He attested all things in him, how is it that Paul himself said, \"We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away? \"[fn-36-P3657_1017906:383-nf] What other one did he look for, when he uttered these words? For if he professes himself to be looking for some perfect one, and if some one must needs come, show us who it is of whom he speaks; lest that word of his perchance appear to carry us back to this man, Manes, or to him who has sent him, that is to say, Satan, according to your affirmation. But if you admit that that which is perfect is yet to come, then this excludes Satan; and if you look for the coming of Satan, then that excludes the perfect.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":24,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_209_letter_cxci","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"ON reading the letter of your reverence I heartily thanked God.

No one ought to cherish a grudge against the sinner who repents, but heartily to forgive him.[fn-29-P2942_965744:47-nf] He who says that he has repented of a sin ought not only to be pricked with compunction for his sin, but also to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.[fn-29-P2943_965917:48-nf] He who has been corrected in first faults, and received pardon, if he sins again prepares for himself a judgment of wrath worse than the former.[fn-29-P2944_966079:49-nf] He, who after the first and second admonition[fn-29-P2945_966146:50-nf] abides in his fault, ought to be brought before the person in authority,[fn-29-P2946_966238:51-nf] if haply after being rebuked by more he may be ashamed.[fn-29-P2947_966420:52-nf] If even thus he fail to be set right he is to be cut off from the rest as one that maketh to offend, and regarded as a heathen and a publican,[fn-29-P2948_966584:53-nf] for the security of them that are obedient, according to the saving, When the impious fall the righteous tremble.[fn-29-P2949_966720:54-nf] He should be grieved over as a limb cut from the body. The sun ought not to go down upon a brother's wrath,[fn-29-P2950_966854:55-nf] lest haply night come between brother and brother, and make the charge stand in the day of judgment. A Christian ought not to wait for an opportunity for his own amendment,[fn-29-P2951_967045:56-nf] because there is no certainty about the morrow; for many after many devices bare not reached the morrow. He ought not to be beguiled by over eating, whence come dreams in the night. He ought not to be distracted by immoderate toil, nor overstep the bounds of sufficiency, as the apostle says, \"Having food and raiment let us be therewith content;\"[fn-29-P2952_967432:57-nf] unnecessary abundance gives appearance of covetousness, and covetousness is condemned as idolatry.[fn-29-P2953_967550:58-nf] A Christian ought not to be a lover of money,[fn-29-P2954_967614:59-nf] nor lay up treasure for unprofitable ends. He who comes to God ought to embrace poverty in all things, and to be riveted in the fear of God, according to the words, \"Rivet my flesh in thy fear, for I am afraid of thy judgments.\"[fn-29-P2955_967884:60-nf] The Lord grant that you may receive what I have said with full conviction and shew forth fruits worthy of the Spirit to the glory of God, by God's good pleasure, and the cooperation of our Lord Jesus Christ.","title":"Letter XXII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":24,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_56_letter_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"4. Now the proper way to direct our investigation seems to me to be as follows. We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, \"But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.\"[fn-31-P3112_1012024:7-nf] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God;[fn-31-P3113_1012350:8-nf] for we are taught by Holy Scripture that \"All things were made by Him,\"[fn-31-P3114_1012794:9-nf] and \"by Him consist.\"[fn-31-P3115_1012831:10-nf] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.[fn-31-P3116_1013067:11-nf] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,[fn-31-P3117_1013181:12-nf] which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
