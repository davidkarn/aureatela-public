{"verses":["Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who\ntaking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.","And five of them were foolish and five wise.","But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil\nwith them.","But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.","And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.","And at midnight there was a cry made:  Behold the bridegroom\ncometh.  Go ye forth to meet him.","Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.","And the foolish said to the wise:  Give us of your oil, for our\nlamps are gone out.","The wise answered, saying:  Lest perhaps there be not enough for\nus and for you, go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves.","Now whilst they went to buy the bridegroom came:  and they that\nwere ready went in with him to the marriage.  And the door was shut.","But at last came also the other virgins, saying:  Lord, Lord,\nopen to us.","But he answering said:  Amen I say to you, I know you not.","Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.","For even as a man going into a far country called his servants\nand delivered to them his goods;","And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to\nanother one, to every one according to his proper ability:  and\nimmediately he took his journey.","And he that had received the five talents went his way and\ntraded with the same and gained other five.","And in like manner he that had received the two gained other\ntwo.","But he that had received the one, going his way, digged into the\nearth and hid his lord's money.","But after a long time the lord of those servants came and\nreckoned with them.","And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other\nfive talents, saying:  Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents.\nBehold I have gained other five over and above.","His lord said to him:  Well done, good and faithful servant,\nbecause thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee\nover many things.  Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","And he also that had received the two talents came and said:\nLord, thou deliveredst two talents to me.  Behold I have gained other\ntwo.","His lord said to him:  Well done, good and faithful servant:\nbecause thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee\nover many things.  Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","But he that had received the one talent, came and said:  Lord, I\nknow that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown\nand gatherest where thou hast not strewed.","And being afraid, I went and hid thy talent in the earth.  Behold\nhere thou hast that which is thine.","And his lord answering, said to him:  Wicked and slothful\nservant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not and gather where I\nhave not strewed.","Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the\nbankers:  and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.","Take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it him that\nhath ten talents.","For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound:\nbut from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be\ntaken away.","And the unprofitable servant, cast ye out into the exterior\ndarkness.  There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the\nangels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.","And all nations shall be gathered together before him:  and he\nshall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the\nsheep from the goats:","And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on\nhis left.","Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand:\nCome, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you\nfrom the foundation of the world.","For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat:  I was thirsty, and you\ngave me to drink:  I was a stranger, and you took me in:","Naked, and you covered me:  sick, and you visited me:  I was in\nprison, and you came to me.","Then shall the just answer him, saying:  Lord, when did we see\nthee hungry and fed thee:  thirsty and gave thee drink?","Or when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in?  Or naked\nand covered thee?","Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and came to thee?","And the king answering shall say to them:  Amen I say to you, as\nlong as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.","Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand:\nDepart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared\nfor the devil and his angels.","For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat:  I was thirsty and\nyou gave me not to drink.","I was a stranger and you took me not in:  naked and you covered\nme not:  sick and in prison and you did not visit me.","Then they also shall answer him, saying:  Lord, when did we see\nthee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and\ndid not minister to thee?","Then he shall answer them, saying:  Amen:  I say to you, as long\nas you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.","And these shall go into everlasting punishment:  but the just,\ninto life everlasting."]}
