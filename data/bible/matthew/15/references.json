With all this, no one is pressed to endure hardships for which he is unfit; nothing is imposed on any one against his will; nor is he condemned by the rest because he confesses himself too feeble to imitate them: for they bear in mind how strongly Scripture enjoins charity on all: they bear in mind \"To the pure all things are pure,\"[fn-5-P539_241192:98-nf] and \"Not that which entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out of it.\"[fn-5-P540_241302:99-nf] Accordingly, all their endeavors are concerned not about the rejection of kinds of food as polluted, but about the subjugation of inordinate desire and the maintenance of brotherly love. They remember, \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them;\"[fn-5-P541_241612:100-nf] and again, \"Neither if we eat shall we abound, nor if we refrain from eating shall we be in want;\"[fn-5-P542_241733:101-nf] and, above all, this: \"It is good, my brethren, not to eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother is offended;\" for this passage shows that love is the end to be aimed at in all these things. \"For one man,\" he says, \"believes that he can eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. He that eateth, let him not despise him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath approved him. Who art thou that thou shouldest judge another man's servant?

Let us not, then, any more judge one another: but judge this rather, that ye place no stumbling-block, or cause of offence, in the way of a brother. I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing common in itself: but to him that thinketh anything to be common, to him it is common.\" Could he have shown better that it is not in the things we eat, but in the mind, that there is a power able to pollute it, and therefore that even those who are fit to think lightly of these things, and know perfectly that they are not polluted if they take any food in mental superiority, without being gluttons, should still have regard to charity?

For the apostle says, \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.\"[fn-4-P411_85270:3-nf] But the Saviour also, who cleanseth all meats, says, \"Not that which goeth into a man defileth the man, but that which cometh out.\"[fn-4-P412_85420:4-nf] And this meets the case of the captive women defiled by the barbarians, who outraged their bodies. But if the previous life of any such person convicted him of going, as it is written, after the eyes of fornicators, the habit of fornication evidently becomes an object of suspicion also in the time of captivity. And one ought not readily to have communion with such women in prayers. If any one, however, has lived in the utmost chastity, and has shown in time past a manner of life pure and free from all suspicion, and now falls into wantonness through force of necessity, we have an example for our guidance,-namely, the instance of the damsel in Deuteronomy, whom a man finds in the field, and forces her and lies with her. \"Unto the damsel,\" he says, \"ye shall do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: the damsel cried, and there was none to help her.\"[fn-4-P413_86403:5-nf] ","title":"Canonical Epistle.","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_07_on_the_morals_of_the_manichaeans_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"31.

For at the time when the apostle wrote, the flesh of sacrifices was often sold in the market. And because wine, too, was used in libations to the gods of the Gentiles, many weaker brethren, accustomed to purchase such things, preferred to abstain entirely from flesh and wine rather than run the risk of having fellowship, as they considered it, with idols, even ignorantly. And, for their sakes, even those who were stronger, and had faith enough to see the insignificance of these things, knowing that nothing is unclean except from an evil conscience, and holding by the saying of the Lord, \"Not that which entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out of it,\"[fn-6-P648_299826:15-nf] still, lest these weaker brethren should stumble, were bound to abstain from these things. And this is not a mere theory, but is clearly taught in the epistles of the apostle himself. For you are in the habit of quoting only the words, \"It is good, brethren, neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine,\" without adding what follows, \"nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended or is made weak.\" These words show the intention of the apostle in giving the admonition.","title":"On the Morals of the Manichaeans.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"244","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Pardon, I beseech you, an aggrieved man: if I speak in tears and in anger it is because I have been injured.

But if any one thinks it hard or reprehensible that I have placed the same interval between virginity and wedlock as there is between fine corn and barley, let him read the book of the holy Ambrose \"On Widows,\" and he will find, among other statements concerning virginity and marriage, the following:[fn-16-P1642_382084:1137-nf] \"The apostle has not expressed his preference for marriage so unreservedly as to quench in men the aspiration after virginity; he commences with a recommendation of continence, and it is only subsequently that he stoops to mention the remedies for its opposite. And although to the strong he has pointed out the prize of their high calling,[fn-16-P1643_382485:1138-nf] yet he suffers none to faint by the way;[fn-16-P1644_382550:1139-nf] whilst he applauds those who lead the van, he does, not despise those who bring up the rear. For he had himself learned that the Lord Jesus gave to some barley bread, lest they should faint by the way, but offered to others His own body, that they should strive to attain His kingdom;\"[fn-16-P1645_382859:1140-nf] and immediately afterwards: \"The nuptial tie, then, is not to be avoided as a crime, but to be refused as a hard burden. For the law binds the wife to bring forth children in labor and in sorrow. Her desire is to be to her husband that he should rule over her.[fn-16-P1646_383161:1141-nf] It is not the widow, then, but the bride, who is handed over to labor and sorrow in childbearing. It is not the virgin, but the married woman, who is subjected to the sway of a husband.\" And in another place, \"Ye are bought,\" says the apostle, \"with a price;[fn-16-P1647_383443:1142-nf] be not therefore the servants of men.\"[fn-16-P1648_383522:1143-nf] You see how clearly he defines the servitude which attends the married state. And a little farther on: \"If, then, even a good marriage is servitude, what must a bad one be, in which husband and wife cannot sanctify, but only mutually destroy each other?\" What I have said about virginity and marriage diffusely, Ambrose has stated tersely and pointedly, compressing much meaning into a few words. Virginity is described by him as a means of recommending continence, marriage as a remedy for incontinence. And when he descends from broad principles to particular details, he significantly holds out to virgins the prize of the high calling, yet comforts the married, that they may not faint by the way. While eulogizing the one class, he does not despise the other. Marriage he compares to the barley bread set before the multitude, virginity to the body of Christ given to the disciples. There is much less difference, it seems to me, between barley and fine corn than between barley and the body of Christ. Finally, he speaks of marriage as a hard burden, to be avoided if possible, and as a badge of the most unmistakable servitude.

For your dignity said that this covetousness that dwells in our bodies is the root of evils; since therefore there is no desire of evil out of our bodies, from that source contrary nature dwells in the whole world. For the apostle designated that, namely covetousness, as the root of evils, not one evil which you have called the root of all evils. But not in one manner is covetousness, which you have said is the root of all evils, understood, as if of that which dwells in our bodies alone; for it is certain that this evil which dwells in us descends from an evil author and that this root as you call it is a small portion of evil, so that it is not the root itself, but is a small portion of evil, of that evil which dwells everywhere. Which root and tree our Lord called evil, as never bearing good fruit, which his Father did not plant, and which is deservedly rooted up and cast into the fire.[fn-8-P897_469020:3-nf] For as you say, that sin ought to be imputed to the contrary nature, that nature belongs to evil; and that this is sin of the soul, if after the warning of our Saviour and his wholesome instruction, the soul shall have segregated itself from its contrary and hostile race, adorning itself also with purer things; that otherwise it cannot be restored to its own substance.

He has quoted the following words of our Teacher: \"For my part I should be inclined to say that this title of the Ungenerate, however fitting it may seem to express our ideas, yet, as nowhere found in Scripture and as forming the alphabet of Eunomius' blasphemy, may very well be suppressed, when we have the word Father meaning the same thing; for One who essentially and alone is Father comes from none else; and that which comes from none else is equivalent to the Ungenerate.\" Now let us hear what proof he brings of the `folly' of these words: \"Overhastiness and shameless dishonesty prompt. him to put this dose of words[fn-8-P845_435970:134-nf] anomalously used into his attempts; he turns completely round, because his judgment is wavering and his powers of reasoning are feeble.\" Notice how well-directed that blow is; how skilfully, with all his mastery of logic, he takes Basil's words to pieces and puts a conception more consistent with piety in their place! \"Anomalous in phrase,\" \"hasty and dishonest in judgment,\" \"wavering and turning round from feebleness of reasoning.\" Why this? what has exasperated this man, whose own judgment is so firm and reasoning so sound? What is it that he most condemns in Basil's words? Is it, that he accepts the idea of the Ungenerate, but says that the actual word, as misused by those who pervert it, should be suppressed? Well; is the Faith in jeopardy only as regards words and outward expressions, and need we take no account of the correctness of the thought beneath?

For `we are a sweet savour of Christ in them that are being saved[fn-98-P9809_3502695:2-nf] ,' as the Apostle says. But since the devil's darts are varied and subtle, and he contrives to trouble those who are of simpler mind, and tries to hinder the ordinary exercises of the brethren, scattering secretly among them thoughts of uncleanness and defilement; come let us briefly dispel the error of the evil one by the grace of the Saviour, and confirm the mind of the simple. For `to the pure all things are pure,' but both the conscience and all that belongs to the unclean are defiled[fn-98-P9810_3503206:3-nf] . I marvel also at the craft of the devil, in that, although he is corruption and mischief itself, he suggests thoughts under the show of purity; but with the result of a snare rather than a test. For with the object, as I said before, of distracting ascetics from their customary and salutary meditation, and of appearing to overcome them, he stirs some such buzzing thoughts as are of no profit in life, vain questions and frivolities which one ought to put aside. For tell me, beloved and most pious friend, what sin or uncleanness there is in any natural secretion,-as though a man were minded to make a culpable matter of the cleanings of the nose or the sputa from the mouth? And we may add also the secretions of the belly, such as are a physical necessity of animal life. Moreover if we believe man to be, as the divine Scriptures say, a work of God's hands, how could any defiled work proceed from a pure Power? and if, according to the divine Acts of the Apostles[fn-98-P9811_3504195:4-nf] , `we are God's offspring,' we have nothing unclean in ourselves. For then only do we incur defilement, when we commit sin, that foulest of things. But when any bodily excretion takes place independently of will, then we experience this, like other things, by a necessity of nature. But since those whose only pleasure is to gainsay what is said aright, or rather what is made by God, pervert even a saying in the Gospels, alleging that `not that which goeth in defileth a man, but that which goeth out[fn-98-P9812_3504717:5-nf] ,' we are obliged to make plain this unreasonableness,-for I cannot call it a question-of theirs. For firstly, like unstable persons, they wrest the Scriptures[fn-98-P9813_3504894:6-nf] to their own ignorance. Now the sense of the divine oracle is as follows. Certain persons, like these of today, were in doubt about meats. The Lord Himself, to dispel their ignorance, or it may be to unveil their deceitfulness, lays down that, not what goes in defiles the man, but what goes out. Then he adds exactly whence they go out, namely from the heart. For there, as he knows, are the evil treasures of profane thoughts and other sins. But the Apostle teaches the same thing more concisely, saying, `But meat shall not bring us before God[fn-98-P9814_3505460:7-nf] .' Moreover, one might reasonably say no natural secretion will bring us before him for punishment. But possibly medical men (to put these people to shame even at the hands of outsiders) will support us on this point, telling us that there are certain necessary passages accorded to the animal body, to provide for the dismissal of the superfluity of what is secreted in our several parts; for example, for the superfluity of the head, the hair and the watery discharges from the head, and the purgings of the belly, and that superfluity again of the seminative channels. What sin then is there in God's name, elder most beloved of God, if the Master who made the body willed and made these parts to have such passages? But since we must grapple with the objections of evil persons, as they may say, `If the organs have been severally fashioned by the Creator, then there is no sin in their genuine use,' let us stop them by asking this question: What do you mean by use? That lawful use which God permitted when He said, `Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth[fn-98-P9815_3506549:8-nf] ,' and which the Apostle approves in the words, `Marriage is honourable and the bed undefiled[fn-98-P9816_3506658:9-nf] ,' or that use which is public, yet carried on stealthily and in adulterous fashion? For in other matters also which go to make up life, we shall find differences according to circumstances. For example, it is not right to kill, yet in war it is lawful and praiseworthy to destroy the enemy; accordingly not only are they who have distinguished themselves in the field held worthy of great honours, but monuments are put up proclaiming their achievements. So that the same act is at one time and under some circumstances unlawful, while under others, and at the right time, it is lawful and permissible. The same reasoning applies to the relation of the sexes. He is blessed who, being freely yoked in his youth, naturally begets children. But if he uses nature licentiously, the punishment of which the Apostle[fn-98-P9817_3507488:10-nf] writes shall await whoremongers and adulterers.","title":"Letter XLVIII. Letter to Amun .

But faith, of which we are compelled, by reason of the arrangement of our subject, to dispute somewhat more at length in this book: faith I say, which they who have are called the faithful, and they who have not, unbelievers, as were those who did not receive the Son of God coming to His own; although it is wrought in us by hearing, yet does not belong to that sense of the body which is called hearing, since it is not a sound; nor to the eyes of this our flesh, since it is neither color nor bodily form; nor to that which is called touch, since it has nothing of bulk; nor to any sense of the body at all, since it is a thing of the heart, not of the body; nor is it without apart from us, but deeply seated within us; nor does any man see it in another, but each one in himself. Lastly, it is a thing that can both be feigned by pretence, and be thought to be in him in whom it is not. Therefore every one sees his own faith in himself; but does not see, hut believes, that it is in another; and believes this the more firmly, the more he knows the fruits of it, which faith is wont to work by love.[fn-16-P1620_799427:4-nf] And therefore this faith is common to all of whom the evangelist subjoins, \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;\" common I say, not as any form of a bodily object is common, as regards sight, to the eyes of all to whom it is present, for in some way the gaze of all that behold it is informed by the same one form; but as the human countenance can be said to be common to all men; for this is so said that yet each certainly has his own. We say certainly with perfect truth, that the faith of believers is impressed from one doctrine upon the heart of each several person who believes the same thing. But that which is believed is a different thing from the faith by which it is believed. For the former is in things which are said either to be, or to have been or to be about to be; but the latter is in the mind of the believer, and is visible to him only whose it is; although not indeed itself but a faith like it, is also in others. For it is not one in number, but in kind; yet on account of the likeness, and the absence of all difference, we rather call it one than many. For when, too, we see two men exceedingly alike, we wonder, and say that both have one countenance.

And yet He who says, \"O woman, great is thy faith;\"[fn-16-P1623_801203:7-nf] and to another, \"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?[fn-16-P1624_801289:8-nf] intimates that each has his own faith.

Some thoughts, then, are speeches of the heart, wherein the Lord also shows that there is a mouth, when He says, \"Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, that defileth a man.\" In one sentence He has comprised two diverse mouths of the man, one of the body, one of the heart. For assuredly, that from which they thought the man to be defiled, enters into the mouth of the body; but that from which the Lord said the man was defiled, proceedeth out of the mouth of the heart. So certainly He Himself explained what He had said. For a little after, He says also to His disciples concerning the same thing: \"Are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is east out into the draught?\" Here He most certainly pointed to the mouth of the body.

Heal us, O my Master; every time that we see Thy Feast, may it cause rumours that we have heard to pass away. Our mind wanders amid these voices. O Voice of the Father, still [other] voices; the world is noisy, in Thee let it gain itself quiet; for by Thee the sea was stilled from its storms. The devils rejoiced when they heard the voice of blasphemy: let the Watchers rejoice in us as they are wont.[fn-25-P2567_956576:10-nf] From amongst Thy fold there is the voice of sorrowfulness; O Thou that makest all rejoice,[fn-25-P2568_956688:11-nf] let Thy flock rejoice! as for our murmur, O my Master, in it reject us not: our mouth murmurs since it is sinful. Let Thy day, O Lord, give us all manner of joy, with the flowers[fn-25-P2569_956884:12-nf] of peace, let us keep Thy passover. In the day of Thy Ascension we are lifted up:[fn-25-P2570_957031:13-nf] with the new Bread shall be the memorial thereof. O Lord, increase our peace, that we may keep three feasts of the Godhead. Great is Thy day, Lord, let us not be despised. All men honour the day of Thy birth. Thou righteous One, keep Thou the glory of Thy birth; for even Herod honoured the day of His birth! The dances of the impure one pleased the tyrant; to Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women be sweet! Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women please, whose bodies Thou guardest holily. The day of Herod was like him: Thy day too is like Thee! The day of the troubled one was troubled with sin; and fair as Thou art is Thy fair day! The feast of the tyrant killed the preacher; in Thy feast every man preaches glory. On the day of the murderer, the Voice[fn-25-P2571_957815:14-nf] was put to silence; but on Thy day are the voices of the feast. The foul one in his feast put out the Light, that darkness might cover the adulterers. The season of the Holy One trims lamps, that darkness may flee with the hidden things thereof. The day of that fox[fn-25-P2572_958170:15-nf] stank like himself; but holy is the feast of the True Lamb.[fn-25-P2573_958250:16-nf] The day of the transgressor passed[fn-25-P2574_958448:17-nf] away like himself; Thy day like Thyself abideth for ever. The day of the tyrant raged like himself, because with his chain it put to silence the righteous Voice. The feast of the Meek One is tranquil like Himself, because His sum shines upon His persecutors. The tyrant was conscious that He was not a king, therefore to the King of kings he gave place. The whole day, Lord, suffices me not to balance Thy praise with his blame. May Thy Gracious day cause my sin to pass away, seeing that it is with the day of the impure one, that I have weighed Thy day! For great is Thy day beyond comparison! nor can it be compared with our days. The day of man is as of the earthy: the day of God is as of God! Thy day, Lord, is greater than those of the prophets,[fn-25-P2575_959261:18-nf] and I have taken and set it beside that of the murderer!

With much wine also He filled the waterpots; they drew it out, yet it failed though it was abundant: of the Cup that He gave though the draught was small, very great was its strength, so that there is no stint thereto. A Cup is He[fn-25-P2581_960863:24-nf] that contains all strong wines, and also a Mystery in the midst of which He Himself is! The one Bread that He brake has no bound, and the one Cup that He mingled has no stint![fn-25-P2582_961055:25-nf] The Wheat that was sown,[fn-25-P2583_961098:26-nf] on the third day came up and filled the Garner of Life.[fn-25-P2584_961172:27-nf] The spiritual Bread, as the Giver of it, quickens the spiritual spiritually, and he that receives it carnally, receives it rashly to no profit.

Then, what had he to do with Galilee, if he did not belong to the Creator by whom[fn-54-P5417_1673261:165-nf] that region was destined (for His Christ) when about to enter on His ministry?[fn-54-P5418_1673352:166-nf] As Isaiah says: \"Drink in this first, and be prompt, O region of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, and ye others who (inhabit) the sea-coast, and that of Jordan, Galilee of the nations, ye people who sit in darkness, behold a great light; upon you, who inhabit (that) land, sitting in the shadow of death, the light hath arisen.\"[fn-54-P5419_1673715:167-nf] It is, however, well that Marcion's god does claim to be the enlightener of the nations, that so he might have the better reason for coming down from heaven; only, if it must needs be,[fn-54-P5420_1674551:168-nf] he should rather have made Pontus his place of descent than Galilee. But since both the place and the work of illumination according to the prophecy are compatible with Christ, we begin to discern[fn-54-P5421_1674766:169-nf] that He is the subject of the prophecy, which shows that at the very outset of His ministry, He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them;[fn-54-P5422_1674953:170-nf] for Marcion has erased the passage as an interpolation.[fn-54-P5423_1675029:171-nf] It will, however, be vain for him to deny that Christ uttered in word what He forthwith did partially indeed. For the prophecy about place He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the synagogue. As the adage runs: \"The business on which we are come, do at once.\" Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; \"[fn-54-P5424_1675421:172-nf] and, \"It is not meet to take the children'sbread, and to cast it to dogs,\"[fn-54-P5425_1675517:173-nf] -in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely (this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to Israelites first that He offers the \"bread\" of His doctrine; surely it is because they are \"children\" that He shows them this priority.[fn-54-P5426_1675958:174-nf] Observe, He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as \"dogs.\" For to whom else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the synagogue-one so abruptly appearing,[fn-54-P5427_1676287:175-nf] so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus-that most faithful witness of the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that He must not be admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right of entering[fn-54-P5428_1676727:176-nf] the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But \"they were all astonished at His doctrine.\" Of course they were; \"for, says (St. Luke), \"His word was with power[fn-54-P5429_1677113:177-nf] -not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets. No doubt, His divine discourse[fn-54-P5430_1677231:178-nf] gave forth both power and grace, building up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. Otherwise, instead of \"astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also, without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity, Inasmuch, then, as the Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally[fn-54-P5431_1677982:179-nf] shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact).

As the adage runs: \"The business on which we are come, do at once.\" Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; \"[fn-54-P5424_1675421:172-nf] and, \"It is not meet to take the children'sbread, and to cast it to dogs,\"[fn-54-P5425_1675517:173-nf] -in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely (this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to Israelites first that He offers the \"bread\" of His doctrine; surely it is because they are \"children\" that He shows them this priority.[fn-54-P5426_1675958:174-nf] Observe, He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as \"dogs.\" For to whom else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the synagogue-one so abruptly appearing,[fn-54-P5427_1676287:175-nf] so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus-that most faithful witness of the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that He must not be admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right of entering[fn-54-P5428_1676727:176-nf] the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But \"they were all astonished at His doctrine.\" Of course they were; \"for, says (St. Luke), \"His word was with power[fn-54-P5429_1677113:177-nf] -not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets. No doubt, His divine discourse[fn-54-P5430_1677231:178-nf] gave forth both power and grace, building up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. Otherwise, instead of \"astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also, without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity, Inasmuch, then, as the Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally[fn-54-P5431_1677982:179-nf] shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged as belonging to Him,[fn-54-P5432_1678239:180-nf] in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged a deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In the same passage, \"the spirit of an unclean devil\" exclaims: \"What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God.\"[fn-54-P5433_1678598:181-nf] I do not here raise the question whether this appellation was suitable to one who ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by the Creator.[fn-54-P5434_1678771:182-nf] Elsewhere[fn-54-P5435_1678806:183-nf] there has been already given a full consideration of His titles.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_22_psalm_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"15. That happy man, then, will become like unto this tree when he shall be transplanted, as the thief was, into the garden and set to grow beside the rills of water: and his planting will be that happy new planting which cannot be uprooted, to which the Lord refers in the Gospels when He curses the other kind of planting and says: Every planting that My Father hath not planted shall be rooted up[fn-24-P2458_1568466:17-nf] .

But delay in point of time depends upon the fulness of times. For the dispensation of yielding fruit waits upon the fulness of time. Now what, you ask, is this fruit that is to be dispensed? That assuredly of which this same Apostle is speaking when he says: And He will change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like His glorious body[fn-24-P2462_1569853:21-nf] .

Matthew, accordingly, proceeds with his narrative, after the notice of that discourse which the Lord delivered in the presence of the Pharisees on the subject of the unwashed hands. Preserving also the order of the succeeding events, as far as it is indicated by the transitions from the one to the other, he introduces this account into the context in the following manner: \"And Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But He answered her not a word,\" and so on, down to the words, \"O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.\"[fn-19-P1959_812847:414-nf] This story of the woman of Canaan is recorded also by Mark, who keeps the same order of events, and gives no occasion to raise any question as to a want of harmony, unless it be found in the circumstance that he tells us how the Lord was in the house at the time when the said woman came to Him with the petition on behalf of her daughter.[fn-19-P1960_813211:415-nf] Now we might readily suppose that Matthew has simply omitted mention of the house, while nevertheless relating the same occurrence. But inasmuch as he states that the disciples made the suggestion to Him in these terms, \"Send her away, for she crieth after us,\" he seems to imply distinctly that the woman gave utterance to these cries of entreaty behind the Lord as He walked on. In what sense, then, could it have been \"in the house,\" unless we are to take Mark to have intimated the fact, that she had gone into the place where Jesus then was, when he mentioned at the beginning of the narrative that He was in the house? But when Matthew says that \"He answered her not a word,\" he has given us also to understand what neither of the two evangelists has related explicitly,-namely, the fact that during that silence which He maintained Jesus went out of the house. And in this manner all the other particulars arebrought into a connection which from this point onwards presents no kind of appearance of discrepancy. For as to what Mark records with respect to the answer which the Lord gave her, to the effect that it was not meet to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs, that, reply was returned only after the interposition of certain sayings which Matthew has not left unrecorded. That is to say, [we are to suppose that] there came in first the request which the disciples addressed to Him in regard to the woman's case, and the answer He gave them, to the effect that He was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; that next there was her own approach, or, in other words, her coming after Him, and worshipping Him, saying, \"Lord, help me;\" and that then, after all these incidents, those words were spoken which have been recorded by both the evangelists.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":52,"source_paragraph":"240","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"104. Matthew proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: \"And when Jesus had departed from thence, He came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. And great multitudes came unto Him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them; insomuch that the multitudes wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. Then Jesus called His disciples unto Him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat,\" and so on, down to the words, \"And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.\"[fn-19-P1964_816011:416-nf] This other miracle of the seven loaves and the few little fishes is recorded also by Mark, and that too in almost the same order; the exception being that he inserts before it a narrative given by no other,-namely, that relating to the deaf man whose ears the Lord opened, when He spat and said, \"Effeta,\" that is, Be opened.[fn-19-P1965_816361:417-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":53,"source_paragraph":"243","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"106.

In this case, indeed, Mark also keeps the same order; and after his account of the miracle of the seven loaves, subjoins the same intimation as is given us in Matthew, only with this difference, that Matthew's expression for the locality is not Dalmanutha, as is read in certain codices, but Magedan.[fn-19-P1975_819959:423-nf] There is no reason, however, for questioning the fact that it is the same place that is intended under both names. For most codices, even of Mark's Gospel, give no other reading than that of Magedan.[fn-19-P1976_820185:424-nf] Neither should any difficulty be felt in the fact that Mark does not say, as Matthew does, that in the answer which the Lord returned to those who sought after a sign, He referred to Jonah, but mentions simply that He replied in these terms: \"There shall no sign be given unto it.\" For we are given to understand what kind of sign they asked-namely, one from heaven. And he has simply omitted to specify the words which Matthew has introduced regarding Jonas.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"24. We have already said as much as appeared desirable of the curse pronounced on every one that hangs on a tree. Enough has been said to show that the command to kill any prophet or prince who tried to turn away the children of Israel from their God, or to break any commandment, is not directed against Christ. The more we consider the words and actions of our Lord Jesus Christ, the more clearly will this appear; for Christ never tried to turn away any of the Israelites from their God. The God whom Moses taught the people to love and serve, is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, whom the Lord Jesus Christ speaks of by this name, using the name in refutation of the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection of the dead. He says, \"Of the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what God said from the bush to Moses, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him.\"[fn-17-P1723_966801:44-nf] In the same words with which Christ answered the Sadducees we may answer the Manichaeans, for they too deny the resurrection, though in a different way. Again, when Christ said, in praise of the centurion's faith, \"Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel,\" He added, \"And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom shall go into outer darkness.\"[fn-17-P1724_967367:45-nf] If, then, as Faustus must admit, the God of whom Moses spoke was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, of whom Christ also spoke, as these passages prove, it follows that Christ did not try to turn away the people from their God. On the contrary, He warned them that they would go into outer darkness, because He saw that they were turned away from their God, in whose kingdom He says the Gentiles called from the whole world will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; implying that they would believe in the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. So the apostle also says: \"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-17-P1725_968148:46-nf] It is implied that those who are blessed in the seed of Abraham shall imitate the faith of Abraham. Christ, then, did not try to turn away the Israelites from their God, but rather charged them with being turned away. The idea that Christ broke one of the commandments given by Moses is not a new one, for the Jews thought so; but it is a mistake, for the Jews were in the wrong. Let Faustus mention the commandment which he supposes the Lord to have broken, and we will point out his mistake, as we have done already, when it was required. Meanwhile it is enough to say, that if the Lord had broken any commandment, He could not have found fault with the Jews for doing so. For when the Jews blamed His disciples for eating with unwashen hands, in which they transgressed not a commandment of God, but the traditions of the elders, Christ said, \"Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, that ye may observe your traditions?\" He then quotes a commandment of God, which we know to have been given by Moses. \"For God said,\" He adds, \"Honor thy father and mother, and he that curseth father or mother shall die the death. But ye say, Whoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, is not obliged to honor his father. So ye make the word of God of none effect by your traditions.\"[fn-17-P1726_969509:47-nf] From this several things maybe learned: that Christ did not turn away the Jews from their God; that He not only did not Himself break God's commandments, but found fault with those who did so; and that it was God Himself who gave these commandments by Moses.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"31. You follow Adimantus in saying that Christ made no distinction in food, except in entirely prohibiting the use of animal food to His disciples, while He allowed the laity to eat anything that is eatable; and declared that they were not polluted by what enters into the mouth, but that the unseemly things which come out of the mouth are the things which defile a man. These words of yours are unseemly indeed, for they express notorious falsehood. If Christ taught that the evil things which come out of the mouth are the only things that defile a man, why should they not be the only things to defile His disciples, so as to make it unnecessary that any food should be forbidden or unclean? Is it only the laity that are not polluted by what goes into the mouth, but by what comes out of it? In that case, they are better protected from impurity than the saints, who are polluted both by what goes in and by what comes out. But as Christ, comparing Himself with John, who came neither eating nor drinking, says that He came eating and drinking, I should like to know what He ate and drank. When exposing the perversity which found fault with both, He says: \"John came neither eating nor drinking; and ye say, He hath a devil. The Son of man cometh eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.\"[fn-17-P1747_985673:61-nf] We know what John ate and drank. For it is not said that he drank nothing, but that he drank no wine or strong drink; so he must have drunk water. He did not live without food, but his food was locusts and wild honey.[fn-17-P1748_985914:62-nf] When Christ says that John did not eat or drink, He means that he did not use the food which the Jews used. And because the Lord used this food, He is spoken of, in contrast with John, as eating and drinking. Will it be said that it was bread and vegetables which the Lord ate, and which John did not eat?It would be strange if one was said not to eat, because he used locusts and honey, while the other is said to eat simply because he used bread and vegetables. But whatever may be thought of the eating, certainly no one could be called a wine-bibber unless he used wine. Why then do you call wine unclean? It is not in order to subdue the body by abstinence that you prohibit these things, but because they are unclean, for you say that they are the poisonous filth of the race of darkness; whereas the apostle says, \"To the pure all things are pure.\"[fn-17-P1749_986790:63-nf] Christ, according to this doctrine, taught that all food was alike, but forbade His disciples to use what the Manichaeans call unclean. Where do you find this prohibition? You are not afraid to deceive men by falsehood; but in God's righteous providence, you are so blinded that you provide us with the means of refuting you. For I cannot resist quoting for examination the whole of that passage of the Gospel which Faustus uses against Moses; that we may see from it the falsehood of what was said first by Adimantus, and here by Faustus, that the Lord Jesus forbade the use of animal food to His disciples, and allowed it to the laity. After Christ's reply to the accusation that His disciples ate with unwashen hands, we read in the Gospel as follows: \"And He called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear and understand. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. Then came His disciples, and said unto Him, Knowest Thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?\" Here, when addressed by His disciples, He ought certainly, according to the Manichaeans, to have given them special instructions to abstain from animal food, and to show that His words, \"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man, but that which goeth out of the mouth,\" applied to the multitude only. Let us hear, then, what, according to the evangelist, the Lord replied, not to the multitude, but to His disciples: \"But He answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.\" The reason of this was, that in their desire to observe their own traditions, they did not understand the commandments of God. As yet the disciples had not asked the Master how they were to understand what He had said to the multitude. But now they do so; for the evangelist adds: Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Declare unto us this parable.\" This shows that Peter thought that when the Lord said, \"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man, but that which goeth out of the mouth,\" He did not speak plainly and literally, but, as usual, wished to convey some instruction under the guise of a parable. When His disciples, then, put this question in private, does He tell them, as the Manichaeans say, that all animal food is unclean, and that they must never touch it? Instead of this, He rebukes them for not understanding His plain language, and for thinking it a parable when it was not. We read: \"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the drought? But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.\"[fn-17-P1750_989915:64-nf] ","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_28_homily_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"7.

Wherefore a few witnesses, which the Lord deigns to suggest to my mind, I proceed to mention, from out the teaching of Christ concerning humility, such as perhaps may be enough for my purpose. His discourse, the first which He delivered to His disciples at greater length, began from this. \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"[fn-39-P3985_1894979:81-nf] And these without all controversy we take to be humble. The faith of that Centurion He on this account chiefly praised, and said that He had not found in Israel so great faith, because he believed with so great humility as to say, \"I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.\"[fn-39-P3986_1895286:82-nf] Whence also Matthew for no other reason said that he \"came\" unto Jesus, (whereas Luke most plainly signifies that he came not unto Him himself, but sent his friends,) save that by his most faithful humility he himself came unto Him more than they whom he sent. Whence also is that of the Prophet, \"The Lord is very high, and hath respect unto things that are lowly: but what are very high He noteth afar off;\"[fn-39-P3987_1895735:83-nf] assuredly as not coming unto Him. Whence also He saith to that woman of Canaan, \"O woman, great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou wilt;\"[fn-39-P3988_1895903:84-nf] whom above He had called a dog, and had made answer that the bread of the sons was not to be cast to her. And this she taking with humility had said, \"Even so, Lord; for the dogs also eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\" And thus what by continual crying she obtained not, by humble confession she earned.[fn-39-P3989_1896251:85-nf] Hence also those two are set forth praying in the Temple, the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican, for the sake of those who seem to themselves just and despise the rest of men, and the confession of sins is set before the reckoning up of merits. And assuredly the Pharisee was rendering thanks unto God by reason of those things wherein he was greatly self-satisfied. \"I render thanks to Thee,\" saith he, \"that I am not even as the rest of men, unjust, extortioners, adulterers, even as also this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things whatsoever I possess. But the Publican was standing afar off, not daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven, but beating his breast, saying, God be merciful unto me a sinner.\" But there follows the divine judgment, \"Verily I say unto you, the Publican went down from the Temple justified more than that Pharisee.\"[fn-39-P3990_1897144:86-nf] Then the cause is shown, why this is just; \"Forasmuch as he who exalteth himself shall be humbled, and whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.\" Therefore it may come to pass, that each one both shun real evils, and reflect on real goods in himself, and render thanks for these unto \"the Father of lights, from Whom cometh down every best gift, and every perfect gift,\"[fn-39-P3991_1897538:87-nf] and yet be rejected by reason of the sin of haughtiness, if through pride, even in his thought alone, which is before God, he insult other sinners, and specially when confessing their sins in prayer, unto whom is due not upbraiding with arrogance, but pity without despair. What is it that, when His disciples were questioning among themselves, who of them should be greater, He set a little child before their eyes, saying, \"Unless ye shall be as this child, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?\"[fn-39-P3992_1898064:88-nf] Did He not chiefly commend humility, and set in it the desert of greatness? Or when unto the sons of Zebedee desiring to be at His side in lofty seats He so made answer,[fn-39-P3993_1898257:89-nf] as that they should rather think of having to drink the Cup of His Passion, wherein He humbled Himself even unto death, even the death of the Cross,[fn-39-P3994_1898429:90-nf] than with proud desire demand to be preferred to the rest; what did He show, save, that He would be a bestower of exaltation upon them, who should first follow Him as a teacher of humility? And now, in that, when about to go forth unto His Passion, He washed the feet of His disciples, and most openly taught them to do for their fellow-disciples and fellow-servants this, which He their Lord and Master had done for them; how greatly did He commend humility?[fn-39-P3995_1898908:91-nf] And in order to commend this He chose also that time, wherein they were looking on Him, as immediately about to die, with great longing; assuredly about to retain in their memory this especially, which their Master, Whom they were to imitate, had pointed out to them as the last thing.

Thus then what is written, \"The mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul;\"[fn-43-P4333_2085250:49-nf] of what mouth it speaketh, is the question. For in general when the Scripture speaks of the mouth, it signifies the very seat of our conception[fn-43-P4334_2085412:50-nf] in the heart, where is approved and decreed whatever also by the voice, when we speak the truth, is uttered: so that he lieth with the heart who approveth a lie; yet that man may possibly not lie with the heart, who uttereth other than is in his mind, in such sort that he knows it to be for the sake of avoiding a greater evil that he admitteth an evil, disapproving withal both the one and the other. And they who assert this, say that thus also is to be understood that which is written, \"He that speaketh the truth in his heart:[fn-43-P4335_2085965:51-nf] because always in the heart truth must be spoken; but not always in the mouth of the body, if any cause of avoiding a greater evil require that other than is in the mind be uttered with the voice. And that there is indeed a mouth of the heart, may be understood even from this, that where there is speech, there a mouth is with no absurdity understood: nor would it be right to say, \"Who speaketh in his heart,\" unless it were right to understand that there is also a mouth in the heart. Though in that very place where it is written, \"The mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul,\" if the context of the lesson be considered, it may peradventure be taken for no other than the mouth of the heart. For there is an obscure response there, where it is hidden from men, to whom the mouth of the heart, unless the mouth of the body sound therewith, is not audible. But that mouth, the Scripture in that place saith, doth reach to the hearing of the Spirit of the Lord, Who hath filled the whole earth; at the same time mentioning lips and voice and tongue in that place; yet all these the sense permitteth not to be taken, but concerning the heart, because it saith of the Lord, that what is spoken is not hidden from Him: now that which is spoken with that sound which reacheth to our ears, is not hidden from men either. Thus, namely, is it written: \"The Spirit of wisdom is loving, and will not acquit an evil-speaker of his lips: for of his reins God is witness, and of his heart a true searcher, and of his tongue a hearer. For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole earth, and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: but neither shall the judgment when it punisheth pass by him. For in the thoughts of the ungodly shall there be interrogation; and the hearing of his words shall come from the Lord, to the punishment of his iniquities.[fn-43-P4336_2087902:52-nf] For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmurings will not be hid. Therefore keep yourselves from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and from backbiting refrain your tongue: because an obscure response will not go into the void.[fn-43-P4337_2088195:53-nf] But the mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul.\"[fn-43-P4338_2088347:54-nf] It seems then to threaten them who think that to be obscure and secret, which they agitate and turn over in their heart. And this, it would show, is so clear to the ears of God, that it even calls it \"tumult.\"32. Manifestly also in the Gospel we find the mouth of the heart: so that in one place the Lord is found to have mentioned the mouth both of the body and of the heart, where he saith, \"Are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things which defile a man.\"[fn-43-P4339_2089182:55-nf] Here if thou understand but one mouth, that of the body, how wilt thou understand, \"Those things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart;\" since spitting also and vomiting proceed out of the mouth? Unless peradventure a man is but then defiled when he eateth aught unclean, but is defiled when he vomits it up. But if this be most absurd, it remains that we understand the mouth of the heart to have been expounded by the Lord, when He saith, \"The things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart.\" For being that theft: also can be, and often is, perpetrated with silence of the bodily voice and mouth; one must be out of his mind so to understand it as then to account a person to be contaminated by the sin of theft, when he confesses or makes it known, but when he commits it and holds his peace, then to think him undefiled. But, in truth, if we refer what is said to the mouth of the heart, no sin whatever can be committed tacitly: for it is not committed unless it proceed from that mouth which is within.","title":"On Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_128_on_the_glory_of_martyrdom_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-05","text":"17.

For it is the very voice of Christ who speaks, and says, \"Whosoever shall lose his life for my name's sake, shall receive in this world a hundred fold, and in the world to come shall possess eternal life.\"[fn-97-P9730_3025071:20-nf] And we ought assuredly to reckon nothing greater, nothing more advantageous, than this. For although in the nature of your costly garments the purple dye flows into figures, and in the slackening threads the gold strays into a pattern, and the weighty metals to which you devote yourselves are not wanting in your excavated treasures; still, unless I am mistaken, those things will be esteemed vain and purposeless, if, while all things else are added to you, salvation alone is found to be wanting; even as the Holy Spirit declares that we can give nothing in exchange for our soul. For He says, \"If you should gain the whole world, and lose your own soul, what shall it profit you, or what exchange shall a man give for his soul? \"[fn-97-P9731_3025823:21-nf] For all those things which we behold are worthless, and such as resting on weak foundations, are unable to sustain the weight of their own mass. For whatever is received from the world is made of no account by the antiquity of time. Whence, that nothing should be sweet or dear that might be preferred to the desires of eternal life, things which are of personal right and individual law are cut off by the Lord's precepts; so that in the undergoing of tortures, for instance, the son should not soften the suffering father, and private affection should not change the heart that was previously pledged to enduring strength, into another disposition. Christ of His own right ordained that truth and salvation alone must be embraced in the midst of great sufferings, under which wife, and children, and grandchildren, under which all the offspring of one's bowels, must be forsaken, and the victory be claimed.

What then is that bread? and why is itcalled daily? Because this is necessary as the other; for without it we cannot live; withoutbread we cannot live. It is shamelessness to askfor wealth from God; it is no shamelessness toask for daily bread. That which ministereth to pride is one thing, that which ministereth to life another. Nevertheless, because this breadwhich may be seen and handled, is given both to the good and bad; there is a daily bread, for which the children pray. That is the word of God, which is dealt out to us day by day. Our bread is daily bread; and by it live not our bodies, but our souls. It is necessary for us who are even now labourers in the vineyard,-it is our food, not our hire. For he that hires the labourer into the vineyard owes him two things; food, that he faint not, and his hire, wherewith he may rejoice. Our daily food then in this earth is the word of God, which is dealt out always in the Churches: our hire after labour is called eternal life. Again, if by this our daily bread thou understand what the faithful[fn-33-P3316_1450717:23-nf] receive, what ye shall receive, when ye have been baptized, it is with good reason that we ask and say, \"Give us this day our daily bread;\" that we may live in such sort, as that we be not separated from the Holy Altar.","title":"Sermon VI.

Then, again, in dealing with the question, \"Art thou the prophet? \"Heracleon does not regard the addition of the article as having any special force, and says, \"They asked him if he were a prophet, wishing to know this more general fact.\" Again, not Heracleon alone, but, so far as I am informed, all those who diverge from our views, as if they had not been able to deal with a trifling ambiguity and to draw the proper distinction, suppose John to be greater than Elijah and than all the prophets.

But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\"[fn-78-P7867_1667783:42-nf] And though He had not laid bare the interpretation, but still continued to use metaphorical language, the disciples would have understood that the discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called leaven, which the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. So long, then, as we have Jesus with us fulfilling the promise which runs, \"Lo, I am with you always unto the consummation of the age,\"[fn-78-P7868_1668211:43-nf] we cannot fast nor be in want of food, so that, because of want of it we should desire to take and eat the forbidden leaven, even from the Pharisees and Sadducees. Now there may sometimes be a time, when He is with us, that we are without food, as is spoken of in the passage above, \"They continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat; \"[fn-78-P7869_1668582:44-nf] but, even though this should happen, being unwilling to send us away fasting lest we faint on the way, He gives thanks over the loaves which were with the disciples, and causes us to have the seven baskets over from the seven loaves, as we have recorded. And moreover this also is to be observed, in view of those who think that the divinity of the Saviour is not at all demonstrable from the Gospel of Matthew, that the fact that, when the disciples were reasoning among themselves and saying, \"We have no loaves,\" Jesus knew their reasonings and said, \"Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves,\"[fn-78-P7870_1669239:45-nf] was beyond the power of man; for the Lord alone, as Solomon says in the third Book of Kings, knows the hearts of men.[fn-78-P7871_1669376:46-nf] But since the disciples understood, when Jesus said, \"Beware of the leaven,\"[fn-78-P7872_1669475:47-nf] that He did not tell them to beware of the loaves but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you will understand that whenever leaven is named it is put figuratively for teaching, whether in the law, or in the Scriptures which come after the law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not right that prayers should take the form of teaching, but should only be supplications of good things from God. But one might inquire, on account of what has been said about disciples who came to the other side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as one of little faith, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what was done by Jesus. But it is not difficult, I think, to say to this, that in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of which \"that which is in part shall be done away,\"[fn-78-P7873_1670341:48-nf] all our faith here is little faith, and in regard to that, we who know in part do not yet know nor remember; for we are not able to obtain a memory which is sufficient and able to attain to the magnitude of the nature of the speculations.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":15,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":141,"source_paragraph":"623","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"For another mystery was accomplished and predicted in the days of Noah, of which you are not aware. It is this: in the blessings wherewith Noah blessed his two sons, and in the curse pronounced on his son's son. For the Spirit of prophecy would not curse the son that had been by God blessed along with [his brothers]. But since the punishment of the sin would cleave to the whole descent of the son that mocked at his father's nakedness, he made the curse originate with his son.[fn-51-P5189_1188726:533-nf] Now, in what he said, he foretold that the descendants of Shem would keep in retention the property and dwellings of Canaan: and again that the descendants of Japheth would take possession of the property of which Shem's descendants had dispossessed Canaan's descendants; and spoil the descendants of Shem, even as they plundered the sons of Canaan. And listen to the way in which it has so come to pass. For you, who have derived your lineage from Shem, invaded the territory of the sons of Canaan by the will of God; and you possessed it. And it is manifest that the sons of Japheth, having invaded you in turn by the judgment of God, have taken your land from you, and have possessed it. Thus it is written: `And Noah awoke from the wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him; and he said, Cursed be Canaan, the servant; a servant shall he be unto his brethren. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. May the Lord enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the houses of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.'[fn-51-P5190_1189976:534-nf] Accordingly, as two peoples were blessed,-those from Shem, and those from Japheth,-and as the offspring of Shem were decreed first to possess the dwellings of Canaan, and the offspring of Japheth were predicted as in turn receiving the same possessions, and to the two peoples there was the one people of Canaan handed over for servants; so Christ has come according to the power given Him from the Almighty Father, and summoning men to friendship, and blessing, and repentance, and dwelling together, has promised, as has already been proved, that there shall be a future possession for all the saints in this same land.

Again, if you ask why, of all the kinds of food prohibited in the former typical dispensation, we abstain only from food offered to idols and from what dies of itself, you shall hear, if for once you will prefer the truth to idle calumnies. The reason why it is not expedient for a Christian to eat food offered to idols is given by the apostle: \"I would not,\" he says, \"that ye should have fellowship with demons.\" Not that he finds fault with sacrifice itself, as offered by the fathers to typify the blood of the sacrifice with which Christ has redeemed us. For he first says, \"The things which the Gentiles offer, they offer to demons, and not to God;\" and then adds these words: \"I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons.\"[fn-25-P2502_1511627:24-nf] If the uncleanness were in the nature of sacrificial flesh. it would necessarily pollute even when eaten in ignorance. But the reason for not partaking knowingly is not in the nature of the food, but, for conscience sake, not to seem to have fellowship with demons. As regards what dies of itself, I suppose the reason why such food was prohibited was that the flesh of animals which have died of themselves is diseased, and is not likely to be wholesome, which is the chief thing in food. The observance of pouring out the blood which was enjoined in ancient times upon Noah himself after the deluge,[fn-25-P2503_1512248:25-nf] the meaning of which we have already explained, is thought by many to be what is meant in the Acts of the Apostles, where we read that the Gentiles were required to abstain from fornication, and from things sacrificed, and from blood,[fn-25-P2504_1512500:26-nf] that is, from flesh of which the blood has not been poured out. Others give a different meaning to the words, and think that to abstain from blood means not to be polluted with the crime of murder. It would take too long to settle this question, and it is not necessary. For, allowing that the apostles did on that occasion require Christians to abstain from the blood of animals, and not to eat of things strangled, they seem to me to have consulted the time in choosing an easy observance that could not be burdensome to any one, and which the Gentiles might have in common with the Israelities, for the sake of the Corner-stone, who makes both one in Himself;[fn-25-P2505_1513181:27-nf] while at the same time they would be reminded how the Church of all nations was prefigured by the ark of Noah, when God gave this command,-a type which began to be fulfilled in the time of the apostles by the accession of the Gentiles to the faith. But since the close of that period during which the two walls of the circumcision and the uncircumcision, although united in the Corner-stone, still retained some distinctive peculiarities, and now that the Church has become so entirely Gentile that none who are outwardly Israelites are to be found in it, no Christian feels bound to abstain from thrushes or small birds because their blood has not been poured out, or from hares because they are killed by a stroke on the neck without shedding their blood. Any who still are afraid to touch these things are laughed at by the rest: so general is the conviction of the truth, that \"not what entereth into the mouth defileth you, but what cometh out of it;\"[fn-25-P2506_1514159:28-nf] that evil lies in the commission of sin, and not in the nature of any food in ordinary use.","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_43_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"You seem to me here to speak a little too hardly of the devil, and to assail the accuser of all with false accusations. You say `he is the universal cause of sin;' and, while you make him the author of all crimes, you free men from fault, and take away the freedom of the will. Our Lord says that[fn-92-P9259_2491178:11-nf] `from our heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses, railings,' and of Judas we read in the Gospel;[fn-92-P9260_2491346:12-nf] \"After the sop Satan entered into him,\" that is, because he had before the sop sinned voluntarily, and had not been brought to repentance either by humbling himself or by the forbearance of the Saviour. So also the Apostle says;[fn-92-P9261_2491595:13-nf] \"Such men I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.\" He delivered to Satan as to a torturer, with a view to their punishment, those who, before they had been delivered to him learned to blaspheme by their own will. David also draws the distinction in a few words between the faults due to his own will and the incentives of vice when he says[fn-92-P9262_2491981:14-nf] \"Cleanse thou me from my secret faults, and keep back thy servant from alien sins.\" We read also in Ecclesiastes[fn-92-P9263_2492131:15-nf] \"If the spirit of a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;\" from which we may clearly see that we commit sin if we give opportunity to the power which rises up, and if we fail to hurl down headlong the enemy who is scaling our walls. As to your threatening your brothers, that is, those who accuse you, with eternal fire in company with the devil, it seems to me that you do not so much drag your brethren down as raise the devil up, since he, according to you, is to be punished only with the same fires as Christian men. But you well know, I think, what eternal fires mean according to the ideas of Origen, namely, the sinners' conscience, and the remorse which galls their hearts within. These ideas he thinks are intended in the words of Isaiah:[fn-92-P9264_2492908:16-nf] \"Their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched.\" And in the words addressed to Babylon:[fn-92-P9265_2493031:17-nf] \"Thou hast coals of fire, thou shalt sit upon them, these shall be thy help.\" So also in the Psalm it is said to the penitent;[fn-92-P9266_2493420:18-nf] \"What shall be given to thee, or what shall be done more for thee against thee false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with desolating coals;\" which means (according to him) that the arrows of God's precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in another place,[fn-92-P9267_2493718:19-nf] \"I lived in misery while a thorn pierces me\") should wound and strike through the crafty tongue, and make an end of sins in it. He also interprets the place where the Lord testifies saying:[fn-92-P9268_2493970:20-nf] \"I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish that it may burn\" as meaning \"I wish that all may repent, and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I am he of whom it is written,[fn-92-P9269_2494197:21-nf] \"Our God is a consuming fire;\" it is no great thing then to say this of the devil, since it is prepared also for men.\" You ought rather to have said, if you wished to avoid the suspicion of believing in the salvation of the devil;[fn-92-P9270_2494461:22-nf] \"Thou hast become perdition and shalt not be for ever;\" and as the Lord speaks to Job concerning the devil,[fn-92-P9271_2494600:23-nf] \"Behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast down. I will not arouse him as one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance? Who has first given to me that I may return it to him? for all things beneath the heaven are mine.

But, because that word is admissible in a carnal sense too, it cannot be so used without the religious remembrance withal of spiritual Discipline; for (the Lord) commands that bread be prayed for, which is the only food necessary for believers; for \"all other things the nations seek after.\"[fn-118-P11822_3314545:43-nf] The like lesson He both inculcates by examples, and repeatedly handles in parables, when He says, \"Doth a father take away bread from his children, and hand it to dogs? \"[fn-118-P11823_3314735:44-nf] and again, \"Doth a father give his son a stone when he asks for bread? \"[fn-118-P11824_3314871:45-nf] For He thus shows what it is that sons expect from their father.

We must guard against speaking anything while eating: for the voice becomes disagreeable and inarticulate when it is confined by full jaws; and the tongue, pressed by the food and impeded in its natural energy; gives forth a compressed utterance. Nor is it suitable to eat and to drink simultaneously. For it is the very extreme of intemperance to confound the times whose uses are discordant. And \"whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God,\"[fn-37-P3755_1140452:38-nf] aiming after true frugality, which the Lord also seems to me to have hinted at when He blessed the loaves and the cooked fishes with which He feasted the disciples, introducing a beautiful example of simple food. That fish then which, at the command of the Lord, Peter caught, points to digestible and God-given and moderate food. And by those who rise from the water to the bait of righteousness, He admonishes us to take away luxury and avarice, as the coin from the fish; in order that He might displace vainglory; and by giving the stater to the tax-gatherers, and \"rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's,\" might preserve \"to God the things which are God's.\"[fn-37-P3756_1141146:39-nf] The staler is capable of other explanations not unknown to us, but the present is not a suitable occasion for their treatment. Let the mention we make for our present purpose suffice, as it is not unsuitable to the flowers of the Word; and we have often done this, drawing to the urgent point of the question the most beneficial fountain, in order to water those who have been planted by the Word. \"For if it is lawful for me to partake of all things, yet all things are not expedient.\"[fn-37-P3757_1141654:40-nf] For those that do all that is lawful, quickly fall into doing what is unlawful. And just as righteousness is not attained by avarice, nor temperance by excess; so neither is the regimen of a Christian formed by indulgence; for the table of truth is far from lascivious dainties. For though it was chiefly for men's sake that all things were made, yet it is not good to use all things, nor at all times. For the occasion, and the time, and the mode, and the intention, materially turn the balance with reference to what is useful, in the view of one who is rightly instructed; and this is suitable, and has influence in putting a stop to a life of gluttony, which wealth is prone to choose, not that wealth which sees clearly, but that abundance which makes a man blind with reference to gluttony. No one is poor as regards necessaries, and a man is never overlooked. For there is one God who feeds the fowls and the fishes, and, in a word, the irrational creatures; and not one thing whatever is wanting to them, though \"they take no thought for their food.\"[fn-37-P3758_1142732:41-nf] And we are better than they, being their lords, and more closely allied to God, as being wiser; and we were made, not that we might eat and drink, but that we might devote ourselves to the knowledge of God. \"For the just man who eats is satisfied in his soul, but the belly of the wicked shall want,\"[fn-37-P3759_1143052:42-nf] filled with the appetites of insatiable gluttony. Now lavish expense is adapted not for enjoyment alone, but also for social communication. Wherefore we must guard against those articles of food which persuade us to eat when we are not hungry, bewitching the appetite. For is there not within a temperate simplicity a wholesome variety of eatables? Bulbs,[fn-37-P3760_1143428:43-nf] olives, certain herbs, milk, cheese, fruits, all kinds of cooked food without sauces; and if flesh is wanted, let roast rather than boiled be set down. Have you anything to eat here? said the Lord[fn-37-P3761_1143686:44-nf] to the disciples after the resurrection; and they, as taught by Him to practise frugality, \"gave Him a piece of broiled fish; \"and having eaten before them, says Luke, He spoke to them what He spoke. And in addition to these, it is not to be overlooked that those who feed according to the Word are not debarred from dainties in the shape of honey-combs. For of articles of food, those are the most suitable which are fit for immediate use without fire, since they are readiest; and second to these are those which are simplest, as we said before. But those who bend around inflammatory tables, nourishing their own diseases, are ruled by a most lickerish demon, whom I shall not blush to call the Belly-demon, and the worst and most abandoned of demons. He is therefore exactly like the one who is called the Ventriloquist-demon. It is far better to be happy[fn-37-P3762_1144569:45-nf] than to have a demon dwelling with us. And happiness is found in the practice of virtue. Accordingly, the apostle Matthew partook of seeds, and nuts,[fn-37-P3763_1144773:46-nf] and vegetables, without flesh. And John, who carded temperance to the extreme, \"ate locusts and wild honey.\" Peter abstained from swine; \"but a trance fell on him,\" as is written in the Acts of the Apostles, \"and he saw heaven opened, and a vessel let down on the earth by the four corners, and all the four-looted beasts and creeping things of the earth and the fowls of heaven in it; and there came a voice to him, Rise, and slay, and eat. And Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten what is common or unclean. And the voice came again to him the second time, What God hath cleansed, call not thou common.\"[fn-37-P3764_1145429:47-nf] The use of them is accordingly indifferent to us. \"For not what entereth into the mouth defileth the man,\"[fn-37-P3765_1145556:48-nf] but the vain opinion respecting uncleanness. For God, when He created man, said, \"All things shall be to you for meat.\"[fn-37-P3766_1145695:49-nf] \"And herbs, with love, are better than a calf with fraud.\"[fn-37-P3767_1145774:50-nf] This well reminds us of what was said above, that herbs are not love, but that our meals are to be taken with love;[fn-37-P3768_1145909:51-nf] and in these the medium state is good. In all things, indeed, this is the case, and not least in the preparation made for feasting, since the extremes are dangerous, and middle courses good. And to be in no want of necessaries is the medium. For the desires which are in accordance with nature are bounded by sufficiency. The Jews had frugality enjoined on them by the law in the most systematic manner. For the Instructor, by Moses, deprived them of the use of innumerable things, adding reasons-the spiritual ones hidden; the carnal ones apparent, to which indeed they have trusted; in the case of some animals, because they did not part the hoof, and others because they did not ruminate their food, and others because alone of aquatic animals they were devoid of scales ; so that altogether but a few were left appropriate for their food. And of those that he permitted them to touch, he prohibited such as had died, or were offered to idols, or had been strangled; for to touch these was unlawful. For since it is impossible for those who use dainties to abstain from partaking of them, he appointed the opposite mode of life, till he should break down the propensity to indulgence arising from habit. Pleasure has often produced in men harm and pain; and full feeding begets in the soul uneasiness, and forgetfulness, and foolishness. And they say that the bodies of children, when shooting up to their height, are made to grow right by deficiency in nourishment. For then the spirit, which pervades the body in order to its growth, is not checked by abundance of food obstructing the freedom of its course. Whence that truth-seeking philosopher Plato, fanning the spark of the Hebrew philosophy when condemning a life of luxury, says: \"On my coming hither, the life which is here called happy, full of Italian and Syracusan tables, pleased me not by any means, [consisting as it did] in being filled twice a day, and never sleeping by night alone, and whatever other accessories attend the mode of life. For not one man under heaven, if brought up from his youth in such practices, will ever turn out a wise man, with however admirable a natural genius he may be endowed.\" For Plato was not unacquainted with David, who \"placed the sacred ark in his city in the midst of the tabernacle ; \"and bidding all his subjects rejoice \"before the Lord, divided to the whole host of Israel, man and woman, to each a loaf of bread, and baked bread, and a cake from the frying-pan.\"[fn-37-P3769_1148436:52-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":15,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_53_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"ANF-02","text":"From filthy speaking we ourselves must entirely abstain, and stop the mouths of those who practise it by stern looks and averting the face, and by what we call making a mock of one: often also by a harsher mode of speech. \"For what proceedeth out of the mouth,\" He says, \"defileth a man,\"[fn-39-P3911_1193756:120-nf] -shows him to be unclean, and heathenish, and untrained, and licentious, and not select, and proper, and honourable, and temperate.[fn-39-P3912_1193909:121-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":15,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_140_on_the_jewish_meats_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And thus there was a certain ancient time, wherein those shadows or figures were to be used, that meats should be abstained from which had indeed been commended by their creation, but had been prohibited by the law.

Now, we may say that it is that process of reason which, from what is admitted, procures faith in what is disputed. Now, faith being twofold-the faith of knowledge and that of opinion-nothing prevents us from calling demonstration twofold, the one resting on knowledge, the other on opinion; since also knowledge and foreknowledge are designated as twofold, that which is essentially accurate, that which is defective. And is not the demonstration, which we possess, that alone which is true, as being supplied out of the divine Scriptures, the sacred writings, and out of the \"God-taught wisdom,\" according to the apostle? Learning, then, is also obedience to the commandments, which is faith in God. And faith is a power of God, being the strength of the truth.

For the highest demonstration, to which we have alluded, produces intelligent faith by the adducing and opening up of the Scriptures to the souls of those who desire to learn; the result of which is knowledge (gnosis). For if what is adduced in order to prove the point at issue is assumed to be true, as being divine and prophetic, manifestly the conclusion arrived at by inference from it will consequently he inferred truly; and the legitimate result of the demonstration will be knowledge. When, then, the memorial of the celestial and divine food was commanded to be consecrated in the golden pot, it was said, \"The omer was the tenth of the three measures.\"[fn-57-P5798_1762320:111-nf] For in ourselves, by the three measures are indicated three criteria; sensation of objects of sense, speech,-of spoken names and words, and the mind,-of intellectual objects. The Gnostic, therefore, will abstain from errors in speech, and thought, and sensation, and action, having heard \"that he that looks so as to lust hath committed adultery; \"[fn-57-P5799_1762735:112-nf] and reflecting that \"blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; \"[fn-58-P5800_1762833:113-nf] and knowing this, \"that not what enters into the mouth defileth, but that it is what cometh forth by the mouth that defileth the man. For out of the heart proceed thoughts.\"[fn-58-P5801_1763032:114-nf] This, as I think, is the true and just measure according to God, by which things capable of measurement are measured, the decad which is comprehensive of man; which summarily the three above-mentioned measures pointed out. There are body and soul, the five senses, speech, the power of reproduction-the intellectual or the spiritual faculty, or whatever you choose to call it. And we must, in a word, ascending above all the others, stop at the mind; as also certainly in the universe overleaping the nine divisions, the first consisting of the four elements put in one place for equal interchange: and then the seven wandering stars and the one that wanders not, the ninth, to the perfect number, which is above the nine,[fn-58-P5802_1763774:115-nf] and the tenth division, we must reach to the knowledge of God, to speak briefly, desiring the Maker after the creation. Wherefore the tithes both of the ephah and of the sacrifices were presented to God; and the paschal feast began with the tenth day, being the transition from all trouble, and from all objects of sense.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":15,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"ANF-02","text":"What is involuntary is not matter for judgment.

It is allowable for an earthly and temporal king, though he is [but] a man, to grant to his subjects greater advantages at times: shall not this then be lawful for God, since He is [ever] the same, and is always willing to confer a greater [degree of] grace upon the human race, and to honour continually with many gifts those who please Him?

For they are eager in amassing wealth which they never had before, or else do not give up that which they had, or which is still sadder, they actually strive to augment it under this excuse; viz., that they assert that it is right that they should always support with it their relations or the brethren, or they hoard it under pretence of starting congregations which they imagine that they can preside over as Abbots. But if only they would sincerely seek after the way of perfection, they would rather endeavour with all their might and main to attain to this: viz., that they might strip themselves not only of their wealth but of all their former likings and occupations, and place themselves unreservedly and entirely under the guidance of the Elders so as to have no anxiety not merely about others, but even about themselves. But on the contrary we find that while they are eager to be set over their brethren, they are never subject to their Eiders themselves, and, with pride for their starting point, while they are quite ready to teach others they take no trouble to learn themselves or to practise what they are to teach: and so it is sure to end in their becoming, as the Saviour said,\" blind leaders of the blind \"so that \"both fall into the ditch.\"[fn-40-P4076_1504449:26-nf] And this pride though there is only one kind of it, yet takes a twofold form. One form continually puts on the appearance of seriousness and gravity, the other breaks out with unbridled freedom into silly giggling and laughing. The former delights in not talking: the latter thinks it hard to be kept to the restraint of silence, and has no scruples about talking freely on matters that are unsuitable and foolish, while it is ashamed to be thought inferior to or less well informed than others. The one on account of pride seeks clerical office, the other looks down upon it, since it fancies that it is unsuitable or beneath its former dignity and life and the deserts of its birth. And which of these two should be accounted the worse each man must consider and decide for himself. At any rate the kind of disobedience is one and the same, if a man breaks the Elder's commands whether it be owing to zeal in work, or to love of ease: and it is as hurtful to upset the rules of the monastery for the sake of sleep, as it is for the sake of vigilance, and it is just the same to transgress the Abbot's orders in order to read, as it is to slight them in order to sleep: nor is there any difference in the incentive to pride if you neglect a brother, whether it is because of your fast or because of your breakfast: except that those faults which seem to show themselves under the guise of virtues and in the form of spirituality are worse and less likely to be cured than those which arise openly and from carnal pleasures. For these latter, like sicknesses which are perfectly plain and visible, are grappled with and cured, while the former, since they are covered under the cloak of virtue, remain uncured, and cause their victims to fall into a more dangerous and deadly state of ill health.","title":"IV.

For if it had the power of itself to speak, to discern, to understand, and to reply to what was spoken by the woman, there would have been nothing to prevent every serpent from doing this also. If, however, they say again that it was according to the divine will and dispensation that this [serpent] spake with a human voice to Eve, they render God the author of sin. Neither was it possible for the evil demon to impart speech to a speechless nature, and thus from that which is not to produce that which is; for if that were the case, he never would have ceased (with the view of leading men astray) from conferring with and deceiving them by means of serpents, and beasts, and birds. From what quarter, too, did it, being a beast, obtain information regarding the injunction of God to the man given to him alone, and in secret, not even the woman herself being aware of it? Why also did it not prefer to make its attack upon the man instead of the woman? And if thou sayest that it attacked her as being the weaker of the two, [I reply that], on the contrary, she was the stronger, since she appears to have been the helper of the man in the transgression of the commandment. For she did by herself alone resist the serpent, and it was after holding out for a while and making opposition that she ate of the tree, being circumvented by craft; whereas Adam, making no fight whatever, nor refusal, partook of the fruit handed to him by the woman, which is an indication of the utmost imbecility and effeminacy of mind. And the woman indeed, having been vanquished in the contest by a demon, is deserving of pardon; but Adam shall deserve none, for he was worsted by a woman,-he who, in his own person, had received the command from God. But the woman, having heard of the command from Adam, treated it with contempt, either because she deemed it unworthy of God to speak by means of it, or because she had her doubts, perhaps even held the opinion that the command was given to her by Adam of his own accord. The serpent found her working alone, so that he was enabled to confer with her apart. Observing her then either eating or not eating from the trees, he put before her the fruit of the [forbidden] tree. And if he saw her eating, it is manifest that she was partaker of a body subject to corruption. \"For everything going in at the mouth, is cast out into the draught.\"[fn-95-P9502_2786007:22-nf] If then corruptible, it is obvious that she was also mortal. But if mortal, then there was certainly no curse; nor was that a [condemnatory] sentence, when the voice of God spake to the man, \"For earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return,\"[fn-95-P9503_2786273:23-nf] as the true course of things proceeds [now and always]. Then again, if the serpent observed the woman not eating, how did he induce her to eat who never had eaten? And who pointed out to this accursed man-slaying serpent that the sentence of death pronounced against them by God would not take [immediate] effect, when He said, \"For in the day that ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die? \"And not this merely, but that along with the impunity[fn-95-P9504_2786733:24-nf] [attending their sin] the eyes of those should be opened who had not seen until then?

And thereafter she journeyed diligently to her relation Elisabeth in the hill-country. \"And she entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth,\"[fn-12-P1218_313343:26-nf] in imitation of the angel. \"And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leapt with joy in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-12-P1219_313544:27-nf] Thus the voice of Mary wrought with power, and filled Elisabeth with the Holy Ghost. And by her tongue, as from an ever-flowing fountain, she sent forth a stream of gracious gifts in the way of prophecy to her relation; and while the feet of her child were bound in the womb,[fn-12-P1220_313837:28-nf] she prepared to dance and leap. And that was the sign of a marvellous jubilation. For wherever she was who was highly favoured, there she filled all things with joy. \"And Elisabeth spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? Blessed art thou among women.\"[fn-12-P1221_314287:29-nf] For thou hast become to women the beginning of the new creation.[fn-12-P1222_314373:30-nf] Thou hast given to us boldness of access into paradise, and thou hast put to flight our ancient woe. For after thee the race of woman shall no more be made the subject of reproach. No more do the successors of Eve fear the ancient curse, or the pangs of childbirth. For Christ, the Redeemer of our race, the Saviour of all nature, the spiritual Adam who has healed the hurt of the creature of earth, cometh forth from thy holy womb. \"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.\" For He who bears all blessings for us is manifested as thy fruit. This we read in the clear words of her who was barren; but yet more clearly did the holy Virgin herself express this again when she presented to God the song replete with thanksgiving, and acceptance, and divine knowledge; announcing ancient things together with what was new; proclaiming along with things which were of old, things also which belong to the consummation of the ages; and summing up in a short discourse the mysteries of Christ. \"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour,\" and so forth. \"He hath holpen His servant Israel in remembrance of His mercy, and of the covenant which He established with Abraham and with his seed for ever.\"[fn-12-P1223_315666:31-nf] Thou seest how the holy Virgin has surpassed even the perfection of the patriarchs, and how she confirms the covenant which was made with Abraham by God, when He said, \"This is the covenant which I shall establish between me and thee.\"[fn-12-P1224_315924:32-nf] Wherefore He has come and confirmed the covenant with Abraham, having received mystically in Himself the sign of circumcision, and having proved Himself the fulfilment of the law and the prophets. This song of prophecy, therefore, did the holy mother of God render to God, saying, \"My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour: for He that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is His name.\" For having made me the mother of God, He has also preserved me a virgin; and by my womb the fulness of all generations is headed up together for sanctification. For He hath blessed every age, both men and women, both young men and youths, and old men. \"He hath made strength with His arm,\"[fn-12-P1225_316682:33-nf] on our behalf, against death and against the devil, having torn the handwriting of our sins. \"He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts; \"yea, He hath scattered the devil himself, and all the demons that serve under him. For he was overweeningly haughty in his heart, seeing that he dared to say, \"I will set my throne above the clouds, and I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-12-P1226_317092:34-nf] And now, how He scattered him the prophet has indicated in what follows, where he says, \"Yet now thou shalt be brought down to hell,\"[fn-12-P1227_317245:35-nf] and all thy hosts with thee. For He has overthrown everywhere his altars and the worship of vain gods, and He has prepared for Himself a peculiar people out of the heathen nations. \"He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.\" In these terms is intimated in brief the extrusion of the Jews and the admission of the Gentiles. For the elders of the Jews and the scribes in the law, and those who were richly privileged with other prerogatives, because they used their riches ill and their power lawlessly, were cast down by Him from every seat, whether of prophecy or of priesthood, whether of legislature or of doctrine, and were stripped of all their ancestral wealth, and of their sacrifices and multitudinous festivals, and of all the honourable privileges of the kingdom. Spoiled of all these boons, as naked fugitives they were cast out into captivity. And in their stead the humble were exalted, namely, the Gentile peoples who hungered after righteousness. For, discovering their own lowliness, and the hunger that pressed upon them for the knowledge of God, they pleaded for the divine word, though it were but for crumbs of the same, like the woman of Canaan;[fn-12-P1228_318467:36-nf] and for this reason they were filled with the riches of the divine mysteries. For the Christ who was born of the Virgin, and who is our God, has given over the whole inheritance of divine blessings to the Gentiles. \"He hath holpen His servant Israel.\"[fn-12-P1229_318738:37-nf] Not any Israel in general, indeed, but His servant, who in very deed maintains the true nobility of Israel. And on this account also did the mother of God call Him servant (Son) and heir. For when He had found the same labouring painfully in the letter and the law, He called him by grace. It is such an Israel, therefore, that He called and hath holpen in remembrance of His mercy. \"As He spake to our fathers, I to Abraham and to his seed for ever.\" In these few words is comprehended the whole mystery of the economy. For, with the purpose of saving the race of men, and fulfilling the covenant that was made with our fathers, Christ has once \"bowed the heavens and come down.\"[fn-12-P1230_319436:38-nf] And thus He shows Himself to us as we are capable of receiving Him, in order that we might have power to see Him, and handle Him, and hear Him when the speaketh. And on this account did God the Word deem it meet to take to Himself the flesh and the perfect humanity by a woman, the holy Virgin; and He was born a man, in order that He might discharge our debt, and fulfil even in Himself[fn-12-P1231_319843:39-nf] the ordinances of the covenant made with Abraham, in its rite of circumcision, and all the other legal appointments connected with it. And after she had spoken these words the holy Virgin went to Nazareth; and from that a decree of Caesar led her to come again to Bethlehem; and so, as proceeding herself from the royal house, she was brought to the royal house of David along with Joseph her espoused husband. And there ensued there the mystery which transcends all wonders,-the Virgin brought forth and bore in her hand Him who bears the whole creation by His word. \"And there was no room for them in the inn.\"[fn-12-P1232_320479:40-nf] He found no room who founded the whole earth by His word. She nourished with her milk Him who imparts sustenance and life to everything that hath breath. She wrapped Him in swaddling-clothes who binds the whole creation fast with His word. She laid Him in a manger who rides seated upon the cherubim.[fn-12-P1233_320797:41-nf] A light from heaven shone round about Him who lighteneth the whole creation. The hosts of heaven attended Him with their doxologies who is glorified in heaven from before all ages. A star with its torch guided them who had come from the distant parts of earth toward Him who is the true Orient. From the East came those who brought gifts to Him who for our sakes became poor. And the holy mother of God kept these words, and pondered them in her heart, like one who was the receptacle of all the mysteries. Thy praise, O most holy Virgin, surpasses all laudation, by reason of the God who received the flesh and was born man of thee. To thee every creature, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, offers the meet offering of honour. For thou hast been indeed set forth as the true cherubic throne. Thou shinest as the very brightness of light in the high places of the kingdoms of intelligence;[fn-12-P1234_321741:42-nf] where the Father, who is without beginning, and whose power thou hadst overshadowing thee, is glorified; where also the Son is worshipped, whom thou didst bear according to the flesh; and where the Holy Spirit is praised, who effected in thy womb the generation of the mighty King. Through thee, O thou that art highly favoured, is the holy and consubstantial Trinity known in the world. Together with thyself, deem us also worthy to be made partakers of thy perfect grace in Jesus Christ our Lord: with whom, and with the Holy Spirit, be glory to the Father, now and ever, and unto the ages of the ages.

For had they believed this, they would not dare to act contrary to them, nor imitate the malice of the Jews who slew the Lord. For God having given them a commandment, `Honour thy father and thy mother,' and, `He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death[fn-43-P4341_1806481:5-nf] ;' that people established a contrary law, changing the honour into dishonour, and alienating to other uses the money which was due from the children to their parents. And though they had read what David did, they acted in contradiction to his example, and accused the guiltless for plucking the ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands on the Sabbath day[fn-43-P4342_1806858:6-nf] . Not that they cared either for the laws, or for the Sabbath, for they were guilty of greater transgressions of the law on that day: but being wicked-minded, they grudged the disciples the way of salvation, and desired that their own private notions should have the sole pre-eminence.

And these men likewise, not less than they, seem to me to have received their punishment already in their ignorance of their own folly. For they understand not what they say, but think that they know things of which they are ignorant; while the only knowledge that is in them is to do evil, and to frame devices more and more wicked day by day. Thus they reproach us with our present flight, not for the sake of virtue, as wishing us to shew manliness by coming forward (how is it possible that such a wish can be entertained by enemies in behalf of those who run not with them in the same career of madness?); but being full of malice, they pretend this, and buzz[fn-43-P4344_1808034:8-nf] all around that such is the case, thinking, foolish as indeed they are, that through fear of their revilings, we shall yet be induced to give ourselves up to them.

And this too we can prove by the instances of calls in the gospels. For He chose Andrew and Peter and the rest of the apostles by the free compassion of His grace when they were thinking nothing of their healing and salvation. Zacchaeus, when in his faithfulness he was struggling to see the Lord, and making up for his littleness of stature by the height of the sycamore tree, He not only received, but actually honoured by the blessing of His dwelling with him. Paul even against his will and resisting He drew to Him. Another He charged to cleave to Him so closely that when he asked for the shortest possible delay in order to bury his father He did not grant it. To Cornelius when constantly attending to prayers and alms the way of salvation was shown by way of recompense, and by the visitation of an angel he was bidden to summon Peter, and learn from him the words of salvation, whereby he might be saved with all his. And so the manifold wisdom of God grants with manifold and inscrutable kindness salvation to men; and imparts to each one according to his capacity the grace of His bounty, so that He wills to grant His healing not according to the uniform power of His Majesty but according to the measure of the faith in which He finds each one, or as He Himself has imparted it to each one. For when one believed that for the cure of his leprosy the will of Christ alone was sufficient He healed him by the simple consent of His will, saying: \"I will, be thou clean.\"[fn-54-P5400_1935913:99-nf] When another prayed that He would come and raise his dead daughter by laying His hands on her, He entered his house as he had hoped, and granted what was asked of Him. When another believed that what was essential for his salvation depended on His command, and answered: \"Speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed,\"[fn-54-P5401_1936263:100-nf] He restored to their former strength the limbs that were relaxed, by the power of a word, saying: \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee.\"[fn-54-P5402_1936440:101-nf] To others hoping for restoration from the touch of His hem, He granted rich gifts of healing. To some, when asked, He bestowed remedies for their diseases. To others He afforded the means of healing unasked: others He urged on to hope, saying: \"Willest thou to be made whole?\"[fn-54-P5403_1936737:102-nf] to others when they were without hope He brought help spontaneously. The desires of some He searched out before satisfying their wants, saying: \"What will ye that I should do for you?\"[fn-54-P5404_1936943:103-nf] To another who knew not the way to obtain what he desired, He showed it in His kindness, saying: \"If thou believest thou shalt see the glory of God.\"[fn-54-P5405_1937117:104-nf] Among some so richly did He pour forth the mighty works of His cures that of them the Evangelist says' \"And He healed all their sick.\"[fn-54-P5406_1937276:105-nf] But among others the unfathomable depth of Christ's beneficence was so stopped up, that it was said: \"And Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their unbelief.\"[fn-54-P5407_1937472:106-nf] And so the bounty of God is actually shaped according to the capacity of man's faith, so that to one it is said:\" According to thy faith be it unto thee:\"[fn-54-P5408_1937652:107-nf] and toanother: \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee;\"[fn-54-P5409_1937751:108-nf] to another \"Be it unto thee according as thou wilt,\"[fn-54-P5410_1937830:109-nf] and again to another: \"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\"[fn-54-P5411_1937910:110-nf] ","title":"XIII.

And because she was found worthy, now were the two people to whom He had come made manifest: the Jewish people, to wit, of whom He said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel;\" and the people of the Gentiles, whose type this woman exhibited whom He had first rejected, saying, \"It is not meet to cast the children's bread to the dogs;\" and to whom when she said, \"Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table;\" He answered, \"O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\"[fn-47-P4704_2018362:25-nf] For of this people also was that centurion of whom the same Lord saith, \"Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\" Because he had said,\" I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.\"[fn-47-P4705_2018669:26-nf] So then the Lord even before His Passion and Glorification pointed out two people, the one to whom He had come because of the promises to the Fathers; and the other whom for His mercy's sake He did not reject; that it might be fulfilled which had been promised to Abraham, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-47-P4706_2019010:27-nf] Wherefore also the Apostle after the Lord's Resurrection and Ascension, when He was despised by the Jews, went to the Gentiles. Not that he was silent however towards the Churches which consisted of Jewish believers; \"I was unknown,\" he says, \"by face unto the Churches of Judaea which were in Christ. But they heard only that he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faithwhich once he destroyed, and they glorified God in me.\"[fn-47-P4707_2019474:28-nf] So again Christ is called the \"Corner Stone who made both one.\"[fn-47-P4708_2019558:29-nf] For a corner joins two walls which come from different sides together. And what was so different as the circumcision and uncircumcision, having one wall from Judaea, the other from the Gentiles? But they are joined together by the corner stone. \"For the stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.\"[fn-47-P4709_2019913:30-nf] There is no corner in a building, except when two walls coming from different directions meet together, and are joined in a kind of unity.

The lesson of the Holy Gospel which has just been read, has given us an alarming warning, lest we have leaves only, and have no fruit. That is, in few words, lest words be present and deeds be wanting. Very terrible! Who does not fear when in this lesson he sees with the eyes of the heart the withered tree, withered at that word being spoken to it, \"Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever\"?[fn-47-P4780_2051162:1-nf] Let the fear work amendment, and the amendment bring forth fruit. For without doubt, the Lord Christ foresaw that a certain tree would deservedly become withered, because it would have leaves, and would have no fruit. That tree is the synagogue, not that which was called, but that which was reprobate. For out of it also was called the people of God, who in sincerity and truth waited in the Prophets for the salvation of God, Jesus Christ. And forasmuch as it waited infaith, it was thought worthy[fn-47-P4781_2051680:2-nf] to know Him when He was present. For out of it came the Apostles, out of it came the whole multitude of those who went before the ass of the Lord, and said, \"Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.\"[fn-47-P4782_2051930:3-nf] There was a great company then of believing Jews, a great company of those who believed in Christ before He shed His Blood for them. For it was not in vain that the Lord Himself had come to none \"but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-47-P4783_2052190:4-nf] But in others, after He was crucified, and was now exalted into heaven, He found the fruit of repentance; and these He did not make to wither, but cultivated them in His field, and watered them with His word. Of this number were those four thousand Jews who believed, after that the disciples and those who were with them, filled with the Holy Ghost, spake with the tongues of all nations,[fn-47-P4784_2052597:5-nf] and in that diversity of tongues announced in a way beforehand, that the Church should be throughout all nations. They believed at that time, and \"they were the lost sheep of the house of Israel;\" but because \"the Son of Man had come to seek and to save that which was lost,\"[fn-47-P4785_2052888:6-nf] He found these also. But they lay hid here and there among thorns, as though wasted and dispersed by the wolves; and because they lay hid among thorns, He did not come to find them, save when torn by the thorns of His Passion; yet come He did, He found, He redeemed them. They had slain, not Him so much, as themselves. They were saved by Him who was slain for them. For, as the Apostles spake, they were pricked;[fn-47-P4786_2053320:7-nf] they were pricked in conscience, who had pricked Him with the spear; and being pricked they sought for counsel, received it when it was given, repented, found grace, and believing drunk that Blood which in their fury they had shed. But they who have remained in this bad and barren race, even unto this day, and shall remain unto the end, were figured in that tree. You come to them at this day, and find with them all the writings of the Prophets. But these are but leaves; Christ is an hungred, and He seeketh for fruit; but findeth no fruit among them, because He doth not find Himself among them. For He hath no fruit, who hath not Christ. And he hath not Christ, who holdeth not to Christ's unity, who hath not charity. And so by this chain he hath no fruit who hath not charity. Hear the Apostle, \"Now the fruit of the Spirit is charity;\" so setting forth the praise of this cluster, that is, of this fruit; \"The fruit of the Spirit,\" he says, \"is charity,[fn-47-P4787_2054299:8-nf] joy, peace, long-suffering.\" Do not wonder at what follows, when charity leads the way.","title":"Sermon XXXIX.

But, now that a voice has been heard through all the earth,[fn-119-P11911_3518823:6-nf] declaring that there is a God of truth, and there has been given to every man an eye wherewith to see, those persons are without excuse who are ashamed of incurring the censure of their former companions in error, and yet desire to walk in the right way.

And these descriptions by which the nature of things that are good in themselves can be distinguished, cannot possibly be applied to fasting, for it is not good of itself, nor useful for its own sake because it is wisely used for the acquisition of purity of heart and body, that the pricks of the flesh being dulled the soul may be pacified and reconciled to its Creator, nor is it unchangeably and at all times good, because often we are not injured by its intermission, and indeed sometimes if it is unreasonably practised it becomes injurious.

Else how could these words apply to the person of sinners: \"For I do not the good which I would, but the evil which I hate that I do\"? or even this: \"But if I do what I would not it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me\"? For what sinner defiles himself unwillingly by adulteries and fornication? Who against his will prepares plots against his neighbour? Who is driven by unavoidable necessity to oppress a man by false witness or cheat him by theft, or covet the goods of another or shed his blood? Nay rather, as Scripture says, \"Mankind is diligently inclined to wickedness from his youth.\"[fn-65-P6524_2329546:2-nf] For to such an extent are all inflamed by the love of sin and desire to carry out what they like, that they actually look out with watchful care for an opportunity of committing wickedness and are afraid of being too slow to enjoy their lusts, and glory in their shame and the mass of their crimes, as the Apostle says in censure,[fn-65-P6525_2329895:3-nf] and seek credit for themselves out of their own confusion, of whom also the prophet Jeremiah maintains that they commit their flagitious crimes not only not unwillingly nor with ease of heart and body, but with laborious efforts to such an extent that they come to toil to carry them out, so that they are prevented even by the hindrance of arduous difficulty from their deadly quest of sin; as he says: \"They have laboured to do wickedly.\"[fn-65-P6526_2330358:4-nf] Who also will say that this applies to sinners: \"And so with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin,\" as it is plain that they serve God neither with the mind nor the flesh? Or how can those who sin with the body serve God with the mind, when the flesh receives the incitement to sin from the heart, and the Creator of either nature Himself declares that the fount and spring of sin flows from the latter, saying: \"From the heart proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, etc.\"[fn-65-P6527_2330917:5-nf] Wherefore it is clearly shown that this cannot in any way be taken of the person of sinners, who not only do not hate, but actually love what is evil and are so far from serving God with either the mind or the flesh that they sin with the mind before they do with the flesh, and before they carry out the pleasures of the body are overcome by sin in their mind and thoughts.","title":"XXIII.

For of that Church of the Gentiles which was to come, the woman that had the issue of blood was a type: she touched and was not seen; she was not known and yet was healed. It was in reality a figure what the Lord asked: \"Who touched me?\" As if not knowing, He healed her as unknown: so has He done also to the Gentiles. We did not get to know Him in the flesh, yet we have been made worthy to eat His flesh, and to be members in His flesh. In what way? Because He sent to us. Whom? His heralds, His disciples, His servants, His redeemed whom He created, but whom He redeemed, His brethren also. I have said but little of all that they are: His own members, Himself; for He sent to us His own members, and He made us His members. Nevertheless, Christ has not been among us with the bodily form which the Jews saw and despised; because this also was said concerning Him, even as the apostle says: \"Now I say that Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.[fn-14-P1459_917091:20-nf] He owed it to have come to those by whose fathers and to whose fathers He was promised. For this reason He says also Himself: \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-14-P1460_917298:21-nf] But what says the apostle in the following words? \"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy.\" What, moreover, saith the Lord Himself? \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.[fn-14-P1461_917513:22-nf] He who had said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,\" how has He other sheep to which He was not sent, except that He intimated that He was not sent to show His bodily presence but to the Jews only, who saw and killed Him?

For Christ was not discerned by the ungodly, but was condemned with the ungodly; for it was said concerning Him, \"He was accounted among the wicked.\"[fn-14-P1462_918526:23-nf] The robber escaped, Christ was condemned. He who was loaded with criminal accusations received pardon; He who has released from their crimes all who confess Him, was condemned. Nevertheless even the cross itself, if thou considerest it well, was a judgment-seat; for the Judge being set up in the middle, one thief who believed was delivered, the other who reviled was condemned.[fn-14-P1463_918926:24-nf] Already He signified what He is to do with the quick and the dead: some He will set on His right hand and others on His left. That thief was like those that shall be on the left hand, the other like those that shall be on the right.

He did not proceed Himself to the Gentiles, but sent: to the people of Israel He both sent and came in person, that those who proved despisers should receive the greater judgment, because favored also with the sight of His actual presence.

It may, however, be a question in what way he is called the high priest of that year, seeing that God appointed one person to be high priest, who was to be succeeded only at his death by another. But we are to understand that ambitious schemes and contentions among the Jews led to the appointment afterwards of more than one, and to their annual turn of service.

If it is your intention to persecute me, I am prepared for it: and if you wish to involve me in punishment, I shall not shrink from it; yea, if you mean even to put me to death, I am not afraid: \"For we ought to fear Him only who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\"[fn-38-P3849_1085852:562-nf] Archelaus said: Far be that from me!

What have you to show? Tell us this,-what signs of salvation have you to bring before us?

Wherefore, as you have got the opportunity of speaking first, tell us first to what particular head of the subject you wish us to direct the disputation. Manes said: If you do not offer a second time an unfair resistance to the positions which shall be stated with all due propriety by us, I shall speak with you; but if you mean to show yourself still in the character which on a former occasion I perceived you to take up, I shall address myself to Diodorus, and shall keep clear of your turbulence. Archelaus said: I have already expressed my opinion that we shall be simply abusing the occasion by the mere bandying of empty words. If any one on one side is formal to offer an unfair resistance, leave that to the decision of the judges. But now, tell us what you have got to advance. Manes said: If you do not mean a second time merely to gainsay the positions which are stated with all due correctness by me, I shall begin. Archelaus said: \"If not this,\" and \"if not that,\" are ways of speaking which mark out an ignorant man. You are ignorant, therefore, of what is in the future. But as to this particular thing which you do declare to be still future, to gainsay or not to gainsay is a matter in my own power. How, then, will that argument about the two trees stand, in which you place your trust as in a buckler of the most approved strength? For if I am of the contrary side, how do you require my obedience? And if, on the other hand, there is in me the disposition of obedience, how are you so greatly alarmed lest I should gainsay you? For you maintain that evil remains evil always, and that good remains good always, in utter ignorance of the force of your words. Manes said: Have I employed you as the advocate of my words, so that you may determine also the intelligence that may suit my knowledge? And how will you be able to explain what belongs to another person, when you cannot make what pertains to yourself clear? But if Diodorus now admits himself to be vanquished, my reasonings will then be addressed to you. If, however, he still stands out, and is prepared to speak, I beg you to give over and cease from interfering with the substantiating of the truth. For you are a strange sheep; nevertheless hereafter you will be introduced into the number of the same flock, as the voice of Jesus[fn-38-P3851_1089187:564-nf] also intimates,-that Jesus, namely, who appeared in the form of man indeed, and yet was not a man. Archelaus said: Are you not, then, of opinion that He was born of the Virgin Mary? Manes said: God forbid that I should admit that our Lord Jesus Christ came down to us through the natural womb of a woman! For He gives us His own testimony that He came down from the Father's bosom;[fn-38-P3852_1089673:565-nf] and again He says, \"He that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3853_1089773:566-nf] and. \"I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3854_1089867:567-nf] and once more, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-38-P3855_1089966:568-nf] And there are also innumerable other passages of a similar import, which point Him out as one that came, and not as one that was born.

Archelaus said: Neither am I greater than He, for I am His servant nor can I be even the equal of my Lord, for I am His unprofitable servant; I am a disciple of His words, and I believe those things which have been spoken by Him, and I affirm that they are unchangeable. Manes said: A certain person somewhat like you once said to Him, \"Mary Thy mother, and Thy brethren, stand without; \"[fn-38-P3856_1090615:569-nf] and He took not the word kindly, but rebuked the person who had uttered it, saying, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"And He showed that those who did His will were both His mothers and His brethren. If you, however, mean to say that Mary was actually His mother, you place yourself in a position of considerable peril. For, without any doubt, it would be proved on the same principles that He had brethren also by her. Now tell me whether these brethren were begotten by Joseph or by the same Holy Spirit. For if you say that they were begotten by the same Holy Spirit, it will follow that we have had many Christs. And if you say that these were not begotten by the same Holy Spirit, and yet aver that He had brethren, then without doubt we shall be under the necessity of understanding that, in succession to the Spirit and after Gabriel, the most pure and spotless virgin[fn-38-P3857_1091524:570-nf] formed an actual marriage connection with Joseph. But if this is also a thing altogether absurd-I mean the supposition that she had any manner of intercourse with Joseph-tell me whether then He had brethren. Are you thus to fix the crime of adultery also on her, most sagacious Marcellus?[fn-38-P3858_1092182:571-nf] But if none of these suppositions suits the position of the Virgin undefiled, how will you make it out that He had brothers? And if you are unable to prove clearly to us that He had brethren, will it be any the easier for you to prove Mary to be His mother, in accordance with the saying of him who ventured to write,[fn-38-P3859_1092623:572-nf] \"Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without? \"Yet, although that man was bold enough to address Him thus, no one can be mightier or greater than this same person Himself who shows us His mother or His brethren. Nay, He does not deign even to hear it said that He is David's son.[fn-38-P3860_1092968:573-nf] The Apostle Peter, however, the most eminent of all the disciples, was able to acknowledge Him on that occasion, when all were putting forth the several opinions which they entertained respecting Him: for he said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; \"[fn-38-P3861_1093294:574-nf] and immediately He names him blessed, addressing him thus: \"For my heavenly Father hath revealed it unto thee.\" Observe what a difference there is between these two words which were spoken by Jesus. For to him who had said, \"Behold, Thy mother stands without,\" He replied, \"Who is my mother, or who are my brethren? \"But to him who said, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the living, God,\" He makes the return of a beatitude and benediction. Consequently, if you will have it that He was born of Mary, then it follows that no less than Peter, He is Himself thus proved to have spoken falsely. But if, on the other hand, Peter states what is true, then without doubt that former person was in error. And if the former was in error, the matter is to be referred back to the writer.[fn-38-P3862_1094095:575-nf] We know, therefore, that there is one Christ, according to the Apostle Paul, whose words, as in consonance at least[fn-38-P3863_1094348:576-nf] with His advent, we believe.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_97_epistle_lxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-05","text":"18. Finally, when, after the resurrection, the apostles are sent by the Lord to the heathens, they are bidden to baptize the Gentiles \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" How, then, do some say, that a Gentile baptized without, outside the Church, yea, and in opposition to the Church, so that it be only in the name of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and in whatever manner, can obtain remission of sin, when Christ Himself commands the heathen to be baptized in the full and united Trinity? Unless while one who denies Christ is denied by Christ, he who denies His Father whom Christ Himself confessed is not denied; and he who blasphemes against Him whom Christ called His Lord and His God, is rewarded by Christ, and obtains remission of sins, and the sanctification of baptism! But by what power can he who denies God the Creator, the Father of Christ, obtain, in baptism, the remission of sins, since Christ received that very power by which we are baptized and sanctified, from the same Father, whom He called \"greater\" than Himself, by whom He desired to be glorified, whose will He fulfilled even unto the obedience of drinking the cup, and of undergoing death? What else is it then, than to become a partaker with blaspheming heretics, to wish to maintain and assert, that one who blasphemes and gravely sins against the Father and the Lord and God of Christ, can receive remission of sins in the name of Christ? What, moreover, is that, and of what kind is it, that he who denies the Son of God has not the Father, and he who denies the Father should be thought to have the Son, although the Son Himself testifies, and says, \"No man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my Father? \"[fn-63-P6313_2009240:26-nf] So that it is evident, that no remission of sins can be received in baptism from the Son, which it is not plain that the Father has granted.

But if Christ's disciples are unwilling to learn from Christ what veneration and honour is due to the name of the Father, still let them learn from earthly and secular examples, and know that Christ has declared, not without the strongest rebuke, \"The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.\"[fn-63-P6316_2009880:28-nf] In this world of ours, if any one have offered an insult to the father of any; if in injury and frowardness he have wounded his reputation and his honour by a malevolent tongue, the son is indignant, and wrathful, and with what means he can, strives to avenge his injured father's wrong. Think you that Christ grants impunity to the impious and profane, and the blasphemers of His Father, and that He puts away their sins in baptism, who it is evident, when baptized, still heap up evil words on the person of the Father, and sin with the unceasing wickedness of a blaspheming tongue? Can a Christian, can a servant of God, either conceive this in his mind, or believe it in faith, or put it forward in discourse? And what will become of the precepts of the divine law, which say, \"Honour thy father and thy mother? \"[fn-63-P6317_2010716:29-nf] If the name of father, which in man is commanded to be honoured, is violated with impunity in God, what will become of what Christ Himself lays down in the Gospel, and says, \"He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death; \"[fn-63-P6318_2010967:30-nf] if He who bids that those who curse their parents after the flesh should be punished and slain, Himself quickens those who revile their heavenly and spiritual Father, and are hostile to the Church, their Mother? An execrable and detestable thing is actually asserted by some, that He who threatens the man who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, that he shall be guilty of eternal sin, Himself condescends to sanctify those who blaspheme against God the Father with saving baptism. And now, those who think that they must communicate with such as come to the Church without baptism, do not consider that they are becoming partakers with other men's, yea, with eternal sins, when they admit without baptism those who cannot, except in baptism, put off the sins of their blasphemies.","title":"Epistle LXXII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":15,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_40_letter_xxii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1. Many things are set forth by inspired Scripture as binding upon all who are anxious to please God. But, for the present, I have only deemed it necessary to speak by way of brief reminder concerning the questions which have recently been stirred among you, so far as I have learnt from the study of inspired Scripture itself. I shall thus leave behind me detailed evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their turn will be able to inform others. The Christian ought to be so minded as becomes his heavenly calling,[fn-28-P2894_958820:2-nf] and his life and conversation ought to be worthy of the Gospel of Christ.[fn-28-P2895_958911:3-nf] The Christian ought not to be of doubtful mind,[fn-28-P2896_958979:4-nf] nor by anything drawn away from the recollection of God and of His purposes and judgments. The Christian ought in all things to become superior to the righteousness existing under the law, and neither swear nor lie.[fn-28-P2897_959216:5-nf] He ought not to speak evil;[fn-28-P2898_959264:6-nf] to do violence;[fn-28-P2899_959296:7-nf] to fight;[fn-29-P2900_959324:8-nf] to avenge himself;[fn-29-P2901_959360:9-nf] to return evil for evil;[fn-29-P2902_959403:10-nf] to be angry.[fn-29-P2903_959435:11-nf] The Christian ought to be patient,[fn-29-P2904_959488:12-nf] whatever he have to suffer, and to convict the wrong-doer in season,[fn-29-P2905_959574:13-nf] not with the desire of his own vindication, but of his brother's reformation,[fn-29-P2906_959670:14-nf] according to the commandment of the Lord. The Christian ought not to say anything behind his brother's back with the object of calumniating him, for this is slander, even if what is said is true.[fn-29-P2907_959885:15-nf] He ought to turn away from the brother who speaks evil against him;[fn-29-P2908_959997:16-nf] he ought not to indulge in jesting.[fn-29-P2909_960081:17-nf] he ought not to laugh nor even to suffer laugh makers.[fn-29-P2910_960151:18-nf] He must not talk idly, saying things which are of no service to the hearers nor to such usage as is necessary and permitted us by God;[fn-29-P2911_960597:19-nf] so that workers may do their best as far as possible to work in silence; and that good words be suggested to them by those who are entrusted with the duty of carefully dispensing the word to the building up of the faith, lest God's Holy Spirit be grieved. Any one who comes in ought not to be able, of his own tree will, to accost or speak to any of the brothers, before those to whom the responsibility of general discipline is committed have approved of it as pleasing to God, with a view to the common good.[fn-29-P2912_961124:20-nf] The Christian ought not to be enslaved by wine;[fn-29-P2913_961517:21-nf] nor to be eager for flesh meat,[fn-29-P2914_961568:22-nf] and as a general rule ought not to be a lover of pleasure in eating or drinking,[fn-29-P2915_961668:23-nf] \"for every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.\"[fn-29-P2916_961762:24-nf] The Christian ought to regard all the things that are given him for his use, not as his to hold as his own or to lay up;[fn-29-P2917_961903:25-nf] and, giving careful heed to all things as the Lord's, not to overlook any of the things that are being thrown aside and disregarded, should this be the case. No Christian ought to think of himself as his own master, but each should rather so think and act as though given by God to be slave to his like minded brethren;[fn-29-P2918_962245:26-nf] but \"every man in his own order.\"[fn-29-P2919_962301:27-nf] ","title":"Letter XXII","author":"St. Basil"}]
