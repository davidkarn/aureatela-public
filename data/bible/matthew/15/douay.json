{"verses":["Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:","Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients?\nFor they wash not their hands when they eat bread.","But he answering, said to them:  Why do you also transgress the\ncommandment of God for your tradition?  For God said:","Honour thy father and mother:  And:  He that shall curse father or\nmother, let him die the death.","But you say:  Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift\nwhatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.","And he shall not honour his father or his mother:  and you have\nmade void the commandment of God for your tradition.","Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:","This people honoureth me with their lips:  but their heart is far\nfrom me.","And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and\ncommandments of men.","And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to\nthem:  Hear ye and understand.","Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man:  but what\ncometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.","Then came his disciples, and said to him:  Dost thou know that\nthe Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?","But he answering, said:  Every plant which my heavenly Father\nhath not planted, shall be rooted up.","Let them alone:  they are blind, and leaders of the blind.  And if\nthe blind lead the blind, both fall into the pit.","And Peter answering, said to him:  Expound to us this parable.","But he said:  Are you also yet without understanding?","Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth,\ngoeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?","But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from\nthe heart, and those things defile a man.","For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders,\nadulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.","These are the things that defile a man.  But to eat with unwashed\nhands doth not defile a man.","And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coast of Tyre\nand Sidon.","And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts,\ncrying out, said to him:  Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David:\nmy daughter is grievously troubled by a devil.","Who answered her not a word.  And his disciples came and besought\nhim, saying:  Send her away, for she crieth after us:","And he answering, said:  I was not sent but to the sheep, that\nare lost of the house of Israel.","But she came and adored him, saying:  Lord, help me.","Who answering, said:  It is not good to take the bread of the\nchildren, and to cast it to the dogs.","But she said:  Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs\nthat fall from the table of their masters.","Then Jesus answering, said to her:  O woman, great is thy faith:\nbe it done to thee as thou wilt:  and her daughter was cured from that\nhour.","And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea\nof Galilee:  and going up into a mountain, he sat there.","And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the\ndumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others:  and they cast\nthem down at his feet, and he healed them:","So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame\nwalk, the blind see:  and they glorified the God of Israel.","And Jesus called together his disciples, and said:  I have\ncompassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three\ndays, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting,\nlest they faint in the way.","And the disciples say unto him:  Whence then should we have so\nmany loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?","And Jesus said to them:  How many loaves have you?  But they said:\nSeven, and a few little fishes.","And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.","And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks,\nhe brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the\npeople.","And they did all eat, and had their fill.  And they took up seven\nbaskets full, of what remained of the fragments.","And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children\nand women.","And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and\ncame into the coasts of Magedan."]}
