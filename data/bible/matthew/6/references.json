They fear strangers: let them stand in awe of the brethren too; or else let them have the consistent hardihood to appear as virgins in the streets as well, as they have the hardihood to do in the churches.

If God Himself, He is as capable of beholding whatever is done in secret, as He is just to remunerate what is done for His sole honour.

It follows, therefore, that what cannot appear to be done for God's sake (because God wills not that it be done in such a way) is done for the sake of men,-a thing, of course, primarily unlawful, as betraying a lust of glory.

But as to those feebler spirits who, though they cannot be said to prefer earthly possessions to Christ, do yet cleave to them with a somewhat immoderate attachment, they have discovered by the pain of losing these things how much they were sinning in loving them. For their grief is of their own making; in the words of the apostle quoted above, \"they have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" For it was well that they who had so long despised these verbal admonitions should receive the teaching of experience. For when the apostle says, \"They that will be rich fall into temptation,\" and so on, what he blames in riches is not the possession of them, but the desire of them. For elsewhere he says, \"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\"[fn-2-P261_68462:30-nf] They who were making such a use of their property have been consoled for light losses by great gains, and have had more pleasure in those possessions which they have securely laid past, by freely giving them away, than grief in those which they entirely lost by an anxious and selfish hoarding of them. For nothing could perish on earth save what they would be ashamed to carry away from earth. Our Lord's injunction runs, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"[fn-2-P262_69234:31-nf] And they who have listened to this injunction have proved in the time of tribulation how well they were advised in not despising this most trustworthy teacher, and most faithful and mighty guardian of their treasure. For if many were glad that their treasure was stored in places which the enemy chanced not to light upon, how much better founded was the joy of those who, by the counsel of their God, had fled with their treasure to a citadel which no enemy can possibly reach! Thus our Paulinus, bishop of Nola,[fn-2-P263_69771:32-nf] who voluntarily abandoned vast wealth and became quite poor, though abundantly rich in holiness, when the barbarians sacked Nola, and took him prisoner, used silently to pray, as he afterwards told me, \"O Lord, let me not be troubled for gold and silver, for where all my treasure is Thou knowest.\" For all his treasure was where he had been taught to hide and store it by Him who had also foretold that these calamities would happen in the world. Consequently those persons who obeyed their Lord when He warned them where and how to lay up treasure, did not lose even their, earthly possessions in the invasion of the barbarians; while those who are now repenting that they did not obey Him have learnt the right use of earthly goods, if not by the wisdom which would have prevented their loss, at least by the experience which follows it.","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_10_the_chaplet_or_de_corona_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But I first say a word also about the crown itself. This laurel one is sacred to Apollo or Bacchus-to the former as the god of archery, to the latter as the god of triumphs.

In these respects, the superstition of the military garland will be everywhere defiled and all-defiling. And it is further defiled, I should think, also in the grounds of it. Lo the yearly public pronouncing of vows, what does that bear on its face to be? It takes place first in the part of the camp where the general's tent is, and then in the temples. In addition to the places, observe the words also: \"We vow that you, O Jupiter, will then have an ox with gold-decorated horns.\" What does the utterance mean? Without a doubt the denial (of Christ). Albeit the Christian says nothing in these places with the mouth, he makes his response by having the crown on his head. The laurel is likewise commanded (to be used) at the distribution of the largess. So you see idolatry is not without its gain, selling, as it does, Christ for pieces of gold, as Judas did for pieces of silver. Will it be \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon\"[fn-11-P1101_456710:45-nf] to devote your energies to mammon, and to depart from God?

But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more[fn-4-P455_143027:154-nf] than these cometh of evil.\" The righteousness of the Pharisees is not to forswear oneself; and this is confirmed by Him who gives the command not to swear, so far as relates to the righteousness of the kingdom of heaven. For just as he who does not speak at all cannot speak falsely, so he who does not swear at all cannot swear falsely. But yet, since he who takes God to witness swears, this section must be carefully considered, lest the apostle should seem to have acted contrary to the Lord's precept, who often swore in this way, when he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not;\"[fn-4-P456_143686:155-nf] and again, \"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.\"[fn-4-P457_143818:156-nf] Of like nature also is that asseveration, \"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.\"[fn-4-P458_144026:157-nf] Unless, perchance, one were to say that it is to be reckoned swearing only when something is spoken of by which one swears; so that he has not used an oath, because he has not said, by God; but has said, \"God is witness.\" It is ridiculous to think so; yet because of the contentious, or those very slow of apprehension, lest any one should think there is a difference, let him know that the apostle has used an oath in this way also, saying, \"By your rejoicing, I die daily.\"[fn-4-P459_144520:158-nf] And let no one think that this is so expressed as if it were said, Your rejoicing makes me die daily; just as it is said, By his teaching he became learned, i.e. by his teaching it came about that he was perfectly instructed:the Greek copies decide the matter, where we find it written, Nh thn kauxhsin umeteran, an expression which is used only by one taking an oath. Thus, then, it is understood that the Lordgave the command not to swear in this sense, lest any one should eagerly seek after an oath as a good thing, and by the constant use of oaths sink down through force of habit into perjury. And therefore let him who understands that swearing is to be reckoned not among things that are good, but among things that are necessary, refrain as far as he can from indulgingin it, unless by necessity, when he sees men slow to believe what it is useful for them to believe,except they be assured by an oath. To this, accordingly, reference is made when it is said, \"Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay;\" this is good, and what is to be desired. \"For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil;\" i.e., if you are compelled to swear, know that it comes of a necessity arising from the infirmity of those whom you are trying to persuade of something; which infirmity is certainly an evil, from which we daily pray to be delivered, when we say, \"Deliver us from evil.\"[fn-4-P460_145916:159-nf] Hence He has not said, Whatsoever is more than these is evil; for you are not doing what is evil when you make a good use of an oath, which, although not in itself good, is yet necessary in order to persuade another that you are trying to move him for some useful end; but it \"cometh of evil\" on his part by whose infirmity you are compelled to swear.[fn-4-P461_146289:160-nf] But no one learns, unless he has had experience, how difficult it is both to get rid of a habit of swearing, and never to do rashly what necessity sometimes compels him to do.[fn-4-P462_146701:161-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"187","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"4.

He beholds, it is true, no embattled towns, but he has enrolled his name in the new city.[fn-1-P158_24128:44-nf] Garments of sackcloth disfigure his limbs, yet so clad he will be the sooner caught up to meet Christ in the clouds.[fn-1-P159_24298:45-nf] No watercourse pleasant to the view supplies his wants, but from the Lord's side he drinks the water of life.[fn-1-P160_24430:46-nf] Place all this before your eyes, dear friend, and with all the faculties of your mind picture to yourself the scene. When you realize the effort of the fighter then you will be able to praise his victory. Round the entire island roars the frenzied sea, while the beetling crags along its winding shores resound as the billows beat against them. No grass makes the ground green; there are no shady copses and no fertile fields. Precipitous cliffs surround his dreadful abode as if it were a prison. But he, careless, fearless, and armed from head to foot with the apostle's armor,[fn-1-P161_25042:47-nf] now listens to God by reading the Scriptures, now speaks to God as he prays to the Lord; and it may be that, while he lingers in the island, he sees some vision such as that once seen by John.[fn-1-P162_25257:48-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"252","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The apostle and evangelist John rightly says, in his first epistle, that \"whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.\"[fn-3-P356_63052:167-nf] For, since murder often springs from hate, the hater, even though he has not yet slain his victim, is at heart a murderer.

This very letter-blotted, as you see, with tears-gives evidence of the lamentation and weeping with which I accompanied your departure. With the pretty ways of a child you then softened your refusal by soothing words, and I, being off my guard, knew not what to do. Was I to hold my peace? I could not conceal my eagerness by a show of indifference. Or was I to entreat you yet more earnestly? You would have refused to listen, for your love was not like mine. Despised affection has taken the one course open to it. Unable to keep you when present, it goes in search of you when absent. You asked me yourself, when you were going away, to invite you to the desert when I took up my quarters there, and I for my part promised to do so. Accordingly I invite you now; come, and come quickly. Do not call to mind old ties; the desert is for those who have left all. Nor let the hardships of our former travels deter you.

Many years ago, when for the kingdom of heaven's sake I had cut myself off from home, parents, sister, relations, and-harder still-from the dainty food to which I had been accustomed; and when I was on my way to Jerusalem to wage my warfare, I still could not bring myself to forego the library which I had formed for myself at Rome with great care and toil. And so, miserable man that I was, I would fast only that I might afterwards read Cicero. After many nights spent in vigil, after floods of tears called from my inmost heart, after the recollection of my past sins, I would once more take up Plautus. And when at times I returned to my right mind, and began to read the prophets, their style seemed rude and repellent. I failed to see the light with my blinded eyes; but I attributed the fault not to them, but to the sun. While the old serpent was thus making me his plaything, about the middle of Lent a deep-seated fever fell upon my weakened body, and while it destroyed my rest completely-the story seems hardly credible-it so wasted my unhappy frame that scarcely anything was left of me but skin and bone. Meantime preparations for my funeral went on; my body grew gradually colder, and the warmth of life lingered only in my throbbing breast. Suddenly I was caught up in the spirit and dragged before the judgment seat of the Judge; and here the light was so bright, and those who stood around were so radiant, that I cast myself upon the ground and did not dare to look up. Asked who and what I was I replied: \"I am a Christian.\" But He who presided said: \"Thou liest, thou art a follower of Cicero and not of Christ. For `where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.'\"[fn-8-P868_180486:576-nf] Instantly I became dumb, and amid the strokes of the lash-for He had ordered me to be scourged-I was tortured more severely still by the fire of conscience, considering with myself that verse, \"In the grave who shall give thee thanks?\"[fn-8-P869_180743:577-nf] Yet for all that I began to cry and to bewail myself, saying: \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord: have mercy upon me.\" Amid the sound of the scourges this cry still made itself heard. At last the bystanders, failing down before the knees of Him who presided, prayed that He would have pity on my youth, and that He would give me space to repent of my error. He might still, they urged, inflict torture on me, should I ever again read the works of the Gentiles. Under the stress of that awful moment I should have been ready to make even still larger promises than these. Accordingly I made oath and called upon His name, saying: \"Lord, if ever again I possess worldly books, or if ever again I read such, I have denied Thee.\" Dismissed, then, on taking this oath, I returned to the upper world, and, to the surprise of all, I opened upon them eyes so drenched with tears that my distress served to convince even the incredulous. And that this was no sleep nor idle dream, such as those by which we are often mocked, I call to witness the tribunal before which I lay, and the terrible judgment which I feared. May it never, hereafter, be my lot to fall under such an inquisition! I profess that my shoulders were black and blue, that I felt the bruises long after I awoke from my sleep, and that thenceforth I read the books of God with a zeal greater than I had previously given to the books of men.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"347","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"31.

Still we may approve these things as the swathing bands of an infant faith. He who has been a loyal soldier under a strange banner is sure to deserve the laurel when he comes to serve his own king. When Nepotian laid aside his baldrick and changed his dress, he bestowed upon the poor all the pay that he had received. For he had read the words: \"if thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor and follow me,\"[fn-25-P2585_662084:1852-nf] and again: \"ye cannot serve two masters, God and Mammon.\"[fn-25-P2586_662166:1853-nf] He kept nothing for himself but a common tunic and cloak to cover him and to keep out the cold. Made in the fashion of his province his attire was not remarkable either for elegance or for squalor. He burned daily to make his way to the monasteries of Egypt, or to visit the communities of Mesopotamia, or at least to live a lonely life in the Dalmatian islands,[fn-25-P2587_662552:1854-nf] separated from the mainland only by the strait of Altinum. But he had not the heart to forsake his episcopal uncle in whom he beheld a pattern of many virtues and from whom he could take lessons without going abroad. In one and the same person he both found a monk to imitate and a bishop to revere. What so often happens did not happen here. Constant intimacy did not produce familiarity, nor did familiarity breed contempt. He revered him as a father and every day admired him for some new virtue. To be brief, he became a clergyman, and after passing through the usual stages was ordained a presbyter. Good Jesus! how he sighed and groaned! how he fasted and fled the eyes of all! For the first and only time he was angry with his uncle, complaining that the burthen laid upon him was too heavy for him and that his youth unfitted him for the priesthood. But the more he struggled against it, the more he drew to himself the hearts of all: his refusal did but prove him worthy of an office which he was reluctant to assume, and all the more worthy because he declared himself unworthy. We too in our day have our Timothy; we too have seen that wisdom which is as good as gray hairs;[fn-25-P2588_663778:1855-nf] our Moses has chosen an elder whom he has known to be an eider indeed.[fn-25-P2589_663871:1856-nf] Nepotian regarded the clerical state less as an honour than a burthen. He made it his first care to silence envy by humility, and his next to give no cause for scandal that such as assailed his youth might marvel at his continence. He helped the poor, visited the sick, stirred men up to hospitality, soothed them with soft words, rejoiced with those who rejoiced and wept with those who wept.[fn-25-P2590_664389:1857-nf] He was a staff to the blind, food to the hungry, hope to the dejected, consolation to the bereaved. Each single virtue was as conspicuous in him as if he possessed no other. Among his fellow-presbyters while ever foremost in work, he was ever satisfied with the lowest place. Any good that he did he ascribed to his uncle: but if the result did not correspond to his expectations, he would say that his uncle knew nothing of it, that it was his own mistake. In public he recognized him as a bishop; at home he looked upon him as a father. The seriousness of his disposition was mitigated by a cheerful expression. But while his laughter was joyous it was never loud. Christ's virgins and widows he honoured as mothers and exhorted as sisters \"with all purity.\"[fn-25-P2591_665173:1858-nf] When he returned home he used to leave the clergyman outside and to give himself over to the hard rule of a monk. Frequent in supplication and watchful in prayer he would offer his tears not to man but to God. His fasts he regulated-as a driver does the pace of his horses-according to the weariness or vigour of his body. When at his uncle's table he would just taste what was set before him, so as to avoid superstition and yet to preserve self-control. In conversing at entertainments his habit was to propose some topic from scripture, to listen modestly, to answer diffidently, to support the right, to refute the wrong, but both without bitterness; to instruct his opponent rather than to vanquish him. Such was the ingenuous modesty which adorned his youth that he would frankly confess from what sources his several arguments came; and in this way, while disclaiming a reputation for learning, he came to be held most learned. This he would say is the opinion of Tertullian, that of Cyprian; this of Lactantius, that of Hilary; to this effect speaks Minucius Felix, thus Victorinus, after this manner Arnobius. Myself too he would sometimes quote, for he loved me because of my intimacy with his uncle.

However, when he was afterwards confirmed in heresy, he defended them as the words of other persons.

And here, too, that question comes to light, as it can, which is wont to trouble many, Why the Holy Spirit is not also a son, since He, too, comes forth from the Father, as it is read in the Gospel.[fn-10-P1084_437829:29-nf] For the Spirit came forth, not as born, but as given; and so He is not called a son, because He was neither born, as the Only-begotten, nor made, so that by the grace of God He might be born into adoption, as we are. For that which is born of the Father, is referred to the Father only when called Son, and so the Son is the Son of the Father, and not also our Son; but that which is given is referred both to Him who gave, and to those to whom He gave; and so the Holy Spirit is not only the Spirit of the Father and of the Son who gave Him, but He is also called ours, who have received Him: as \"The salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-10-P1085_438473:30-nf] who gives salvation, is said also to be our salvation, who have received it. Therefore, the Spirit is both the Spirit of God who gave Him, and ours who have received Him. Not, indeed, that spirit of ours by which we are, because that is the spirit of a man which is in him; but this Spirit is ours in another mode, viz. that in which we also say, \"Give us this day our bread.\"[fn-10-P1086_438868:31-nf] Although certainly we have received that spirit also, which is called the spirit of a man. \"For what hast thou,\" he says, \"which thou didst not receive?\"[fn-10-P1087_439041:32-nf] But that is one thing, which we have received that we might be; another, that which we have received that we might be holy. Whence it is also written of John, that he \"came in the spirit and power of Elias;\"[fn-10-P1088_439268:33-nf] and by the spirit of Elias is meant the Holy Spirit, whom Elias received. And the same thing is to be understood of Moses, when the Lord says to him, \"And I will take of thy spirit, and will put it upon them;\"[fn-10-P1089_439496:34-nf] that is, I will give to them of the Holy Spirit, which I have already given to thee. If, therefore, that also which is given has him for a beginning by whom it is given, since it has received from no other source that which proceeds from him; it must be admitted that the Father and the Son are a Beginning of the Holy Spirit, not two Beginnings; but as the Father and Son are one God, and one Creator, and one Lord relatively to the creature, so are they one Beginning relatively to the Holy Spirit. But the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one Beginning in respect to the creature, as also one Creator and one God.[fn-10-P1090_440139:35-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"257","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"3 But I understand that Nicolaus had to do with no other woman than her to whom he was married, and that, so far as his children are concerned, his daughters continued in a state of virginity until old age, and his son remained uncorrupt.

Such \"infirmity\" is equal, to a third, and a fourth, and even (perhaps) a seventh marriage; as (being a thing) which increases its strength as often as its weakness; which will no longer have (the support of) an apostle's authority, but of some Hermogenes-wont to marry more women than he paints.

Not one such wife, but even a plurality, it is permitted to have.

For what else does the phrase \"being justified\" signify than being made righteous, - by Him, of course, who justifies the ungodly man, that he may become a godly one instead? For if we were to express a certain fact by saying, \"The men will be liberated,\" the phrase would of course be understood as asserting that the liberation would accrue to those who were men already; but if we were to say, The men will be created, we should certainly not be understood as asserting that the creation would happen to those who were already in existence, but that they became men by the creation itself. If in like manner it were said, The doers of the law shall be honoured, we should only interpret the statement correctly if we supposed that the honour was to accrue to those who were already doers of the law: but when the allegation is, \"The doers of the law shall be justified,\" what else does it mean than that the just shall be justified? for of course the doers of the law are just persons. And thus it amounts to the same thing as if it were said, The doers of the law shall be created,- not those who were so already, but that they may become such; in order that the Jews who were hearers of the law might hereby understand that they wanted the grace of the Justifier, in order to be able to become its doers also.

A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now applicable: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;\"[fn-18-P1841_803645:387-nf] but in reference to the present life the following: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\"[fn-18-P1842_803803:388-nf] To the one, again, belongs, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-18-P1843_803875:389-nf] to the other, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-18-P1844_803945:390-nf] To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,-so that in the one the just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_08_book_i_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"258","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"147.

What is this? What heardest thou? The unlearned start up and `take' heaven,[fn-12-P1254_531807:76-nf] and we, with our learning, but wanting heart, see where we wallow in flesh and blood!

There was a little garden belonging to our lodging, of which we had the use, as of the whole house; for the master, our landlord, did not live there. Thither had the tempest within my breast hurried me, where no one might impede the fiery struggle in which I was engaged with myself, until it came to the issue that Thou knewest, though I did not. But I was mad that I might be whole, and dying that I might have life, knowing what evil thing I was, but not knowing what good thing I was shortly to become. Into the garden, then, I retired, Alypius following my steps. For his presence was no bar to my solitude; or how could he desert me so troubled? We sat down at as great a distance from the house as we could. I was disquieted in spirit, being most impatient with myself that I entered not into Thy will and covenant, O my God, which all my bones cried out unto me to enter, extolling it to the skies. And we enter not therein by ships, or chariots, or feet, no, nor by going so far as I had come from the house to that place where we were sitting. For not to go only, but to enter there, was naught else but to will to go, but to will it resolutely and thoroughly; not to stagger and sway about this way and that, a changeable and half-wounded will, wrestling, with one part falling as another rose.

Our Lord himself says,[fn-66-P6613_2070547:23-nf] \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" And in the same place, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" If you reply that this was said before the Passion, we certainly say after the Passion, in the Lord's prayer,[fn-66-P6614_2070948:24-nf] \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\" If we do not sin after baptism, why do we ask that we may be forgiven our sins, which were already forgiven in baptism? Why do we pray that we may not enter into temptation, and that we may be delivered from the evil one, if the devil cannot tempt those who are baptized? The case is different if this prayer belongs to the Catechumens, and is not adapted to faithful Christians. Paul, the chosen vessel,[fn-66-P6615_2071498:25-nf] chastised his body, and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate, and[fn-66-P6616_2071645:26-nf] he tells that there was given to him \"a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet\" him. And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy.

Faithful men say in their prayer, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\"[fn-22-P2230_926402:154-nf] But if they already have capacity, why do they pray? Or, what is the evil which they pray to be delivered from, but, above all else, \"the body of this death?\" And from this nothing but God's grace alone delivers them, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not of course from the substance of the body, which is good; but from its carnal offences, from which a man is not liberated except by the grace of the Saviour, - not even when he quits the body by the death of the body.

It is a true confession of its weakness, not a false defence of its capacity, that it stands in need of. It requires the grace of God, not that it may be made, but that it may be re-made. And this is the only grace which by our author is proclaimed to be unnecessary; because of this he is silent!

By His assistance we aver that it becomes holy and happy, by whom it was created in order to be so.

There is, however, this difference between us and them, that we, whenever the devil has to be resisted, not only do not deny, but actually teach, that God's help must be sought; whereas they attribute so much power to will as to take away prayer from religious duty.

What house will ye build Me, or what is the place of My rest? For these things hath My hand made, and all these things are mine[fn-12-P1208_736674:19-nf] ; that He contains all things, as Paul bears witness, For in Him we live and move and have our being[fn-12-P1209_736798:20-nf] , and the psalmist, Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit, and whither shall I fly from Thy face?

This is one ground of excuse. The second[fn-5-P506_342789:3-nf] is of a different kind. As Joseph speaks to his brethren, \"God did send me before you (Gen. xlv. 5); what in the former speech he had briefly said, in the words, \"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken,\"-this he here enlarges upon: \"But what God before had showed by the mouth of all His Prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He hath so fulfilled.\" (v. 18.) At the same time showing, that it was not of their doing, if this be proved, that it took place after God's counsel. He alludes to those words with which they had reviled Him on the Cross, namely \"Let Him deliver Him, if He will have Him; for He said, I am the Son of God. If[fn-5-P507_343855:4-nf] He trust in God, let Him now come down from the cross.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42, 43.) O foolish men, were these idle words? It must needs so come to pass, and the prophets bear witness thereunto. Therefore if He descended not, it it was for no weakness of His own that He did not come down, but for very power. And Peter puts this by way of apology for the Jews, hoping that they may also close with what he says. \"He hath so fulfilled,\" he says. Do you see now how he refers everything to that source? \"Repent ye therefore,\" he says, \"and be converted.\" He does not add, \"from your sins;\" but, \"that your sins, may be blotted out,\" means the same thing. And then he adds the gain: \"So shall the times of refreshing come from the presence of the Lord.\" (v. 19.) This betokens them in a sad state, brought low by many wars.[fn-5-P508_344750:5-nf] For it is to the case of one on fire, and craving comfort, that the expression applies. And see now how he advances. In his first sermon, he but slightly hinted at the resurrection, and Christ's sitting in heaven; but here he also speaks of His visible advent. \"And He shall send Jesus the Christ ordained[fn-5-P509_346303:6-nf] (for you), \"Whom the heaven must (i.e. must of necessity) receive, until the times of the restitution of all things.\" The reason why He does not now come is clear. \"Which God hath spoken,\" he continues, \"by the mouth[fn-5-P510_346635:7-nf] of His holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.\" Before, he had spoken of David, here he speaks of Moses. \"Of all things,\" he says, \"which He hath spoken.\" But he does not say, \"which Christ,\" but, \"which God hath spoken[fn-5-P511_347131:8-nf] by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.\" (v. 20, 21.) Then he betakes him to the ground of credibility, saying, \"A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things.\" And then the greatness of the punishment: \"And it shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those that follow, after, as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days.\" (v. 23, 24.) He has done well to set the distinction here. For whenever he says anything great, he appeals to them of old. And he found a text which contained both truths; just as in the other discourse he said, \"Until He put His foes under His feet.\" (ch. ii. 35.) The remarkable circumstance is, that the two things stand together; that is, subjection and disobedience, and the punishment. \"Like unto me,\" he says. Then why are ye alarmed? \"Ye are the children of the prophets\" (v. 25): so that to you they spake, and for your sakes have all these things come to pass. For as they deemed that through their outrage they had become alienated (and indeed there is no parity of reason, that He Who now is crucified, should now cherish them as His own), he proves to them that both the one and the other are in accordance with prophecy. \"Ye are the children,\" he says, \"of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, `And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.' Unto you first,\" he continues, \"God having raised up His Son (ton Paida) sent Him.\" \"To others indeed also, but to you first who crucified Him.\" \"To bless you,\" he adds, \"in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.\" (v. 26.)","title":"Homily IX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":6,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_16_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"And His name, through faith in His name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.\" Seeking to declare the matter (zhtwn to pragma eipein), he straightway brings forward the sign: \"In the presence,\" he says, \"of you all.\" As he hid borne hard upon them, and had shown that He Whom they crucified had risen, again he relaxes, by giving them the power of repentance; \"And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.\" (v. 17.)

But if,\" continues he, \"he had said in reply, `The fault is your own;' then the answer would be, `How my fault, when I am unable to be without sin?'\" Now our answer to all this running argument is, that no controversy ought to have been raised between them about such words as these; because he nowhere ventures to affirm that a man (either any one else, or himself) is without sin, but he merely said in reply that he can be,-a position which we do not ourselves deny. Only the question arises, when can he, and through whom can he? If at the present time, then by no faithful soul which is enclosed within the body of this death must this prayer be offered, or such words as these be spoken, \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,\"[fn-24-P2495_1006106:48-nf] since in holy baptism all past debts have been already forgiven. But whoever tries to persuade us that such a prayer is not proper for faithful members of Christ, does in fact acknowledge nothing else than that he is not himself a Christian. If, again, it is through himself that a man is able to live without sin, then did Christ die in vain. But \"Christ is not dead in vain.\" No man, therefore, can be without sin, even if he wish it, unless he be assisted by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. And that this perfection may be attained, there is even now a training carried on in growing [Christians,] and there will be by all means a completion made, after the conflict with death is spent, and love, which is now cherished by the operation of faith and hope, shall be perfected in the fruition of sight and possession.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"As long, then, as we are \"absent from the Lord, we walk by faith, not by sight;\"[fn-25-P2504_1008795:51-nf] whence it is said, \"The just shall live by faith.\"[fn-25-P2505_1008864:52-nf] Our righteousness in this pilgrimage is this-that we press forward to that perfect and full righteousness in which there shall be perfect and full love in the sight of His glory; and that now we hold to the rectitude and perfection of our course, by \"keeping under our body and bringing it into subjection,\"[fn-25-P2506_1009189:53-nf] by doing our alms cheerfully and heartily, while bestowing kindnesses and forgiving the trespasses which have been committed against us, and by \"continuing instant in prayer;\"[fn-25-P2507_1009385:54-nf] -and doing all this with sound doctrine, whereon are built a right faith, a firm hope, and a pure charity.

Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain?

To this definition we take no exception, except that we would not ascribe this twofold distinction to the nature (of the soul). It is the rational element which we must believe to be its natural condition, impressed upon it from its very first creation by its Author, who is Himself essentially rational. For how should that be other than rational, which God produced on His own prompting; nay more, which He expressly sent forth by His own afflatus or breath? The irrational element, however, we must understand to have accrued later, as having proceeded from the instigation of the serpent-the very achievement of (the first) transgression-which thenceforward became inherent in the soul, and grew with its growth, assuming the manner by this time of a natural development, happening as it did immediately at the beginning of nature. But, inasmuch as the same Plato speaks of the rational element only as existing in the soul of God Himself, if we were to ascribe the irrational element likewise to the nature which our soul has received from God, then the irrational element will be equally derived from God, as being a natural production, because God is the author of nature. Now from the devil proceeds the incentive to sin. All sin, however, is irrational: therefore the irrational proceeds from the devil, from whom sin proceeds; and it is extraneous to God, to whom also the irrationalis an alien principle. The diversity, then, between these two elements arises from the difference of their authors. When, therefore, Plato reserves the rational element (of the soul) to God alone, and subdivides it into two departments the irascible, which they call qumiko/n, and the concupiscible, which they designate by the term e0piqumhtiko/n (in such a way as to make the first common to us and lions, and the second shared between ourselves and flies, whilst the rational element is confined to us and God)-I see that this point will have to be treated by us, owing to the facts which we find operating also in Christ. For you may behold this triad of qualities in the Lord. There was the rational element, by which He taught, by which He discoursed, by which He prepared the way of salvation; there was moreover indignation in Him, by which He inveighed against the scribes and the Pharisees; and there was the principle of desire, by which He so earnestly desired to eat the pass over with His disciples.[fn-27-P2727_912997:111-nf] In our own cases, accordingly, the irascible and the concupiscible elements of our soul must not invariably be put to the account of the irrational (nature), since we are sure that in our Lord these elements operated in entire accordance with reason. God will be angry, with perfect reason, with all who deserve His wrath; and with reason, too, will God desire whatever objects and claims are worthy of Himself. For He will show indignation against the evil man, and for the good man will He desire salvation. To ourselves even does the apostle allow the concupiscible quality. \"If any man,\" says he, \"desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\"[fn-27-P2728_913680:112-nf] Now, by saying \"a good work,\" he shows us that the desire is a reasonable one. He permits us likewise to feel indignation. How should he not, when he himself experiences the same? \"I would,\" says he, \"that they were even cut off which trouble you.\"[fn-27-P2729_913951:113-nf] In perfect agreement with reason was that indignation which resulted from his desire to maintain discipline and order. When, however, he says, \"We were formerly the children of wrath,\"[fn-27-P2730_914155:114-nf] he censures an irrational irascibility, such as proceeds not from that nature which is the production of God, but from that which the devil brought in, who is himself styled the lord or \"master\" of his own class, \"Ye cannot serve two masters,\"[fn-27-P2731_914418:115-nf] and has the actual designation of \"father: \"\"Ye are of your father the devil.\"[fn-27-P2732_914518:116-nf] So that you need not be afraid to ascribe to him the mastery and dominion over that second, later, and deteriorated nature (of which we have been speaking), when you read of him as \"the sewer of tares, and the nocturnal spoiler of the crop of corn.[fn-27-P2733_914787:117-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_13_book_i_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"207","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"182.

If, because injustice is not from God, but from the devil, and persecution consists of injustice (for what more unjust than that the bishops of the true God, that all the followers of the truth, should be dealt with after the manner o the vilest criminals?), persecution therefore seems to proceed from the devil, by whom the injustice which constitutes persecution is perpetrated, we ought to know, as you have neither persecution without the injustice of the devil, nor the trial of faith without persecution, that the injustice necessary for the trial of faith does not give a warrant for persecution, but supplies an agency; that in reality, in reference to the trial of faith, which is the reason of persecution, the will of God goes first, but that as the instrument of persecution, which is the way of trial, the injustice of the devil follows. For in other respects, too, injustice in proportion to the enmity it displays against righteousness affords occasion for attestations of that to which it is opposed as an enemy, that so righteousness may be perfected in injustice, as strength is perfected in weakness.[fn-19-P1936_571808:4-nf] For the weak things of the world have been chosen by God to confound the strong, and the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom.[fn-19-P1937_571967:5-nf] Thus even injustice is employed, that righteousness may be approved in putting unrighteousness to shame. Therefore, since the service is not of free-will, but of subjection (for persecution is the appointment of the Lord for the trial of faith, but its ministry is the injustice of the devil, supplied that persecution may be got up), we believe that persecution comes to pass, no question, by the devil's agency, but not by the devil's origination. Satan will not be at liberty to do anything against the servants of the living God unless the Lord grant leave, either that He may overthrow Satan himself by the faith of the elect which proves victorious in the trial, or in the face of the world show that apostatizers to the devil's cause have been in reality His servants. You have the case of Job, whom the devil, unless he had received authority from God, could not have visited with trial, not even, in fact, in his property, unless the Lord had said, \"Behold, all that he has I put at your disposal; but do not stretch out your hand against himself.\"[fn-19-P1938_573046:6-nf] In short, he would not even have stretched it out, unless afterwards, at his request, the Lord had granted him this permission also, saying, \"Behold, I deliver him to you; only preserve his life.\" So he asked in the case of the apostles likewise an opportunity to tempt them, having it only by special allowance, since the Lord in the Gospel says to Peter, \"Behold, Satan asked that he might sift you as grain; but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not; \"[fn-19-P1939_573525:7-nf] that is, that the devil should not have power granted him sufficient to endanger his faith. Whence it is manifest that both things belong to God shaking of faith as well as the shielding of it, when both are sought from Him-the shaking by the devil, the shielding by the Son. And certainly, when the Son of God has faith's protection absolutely committed to Him, beseeching it of the Father, from whom He receives all power in heaven and on earth, how entirely out of the question is it that the devil should have the assailing of it in his own power! But in the prayer prescribed to us, when we say to our Father, \"Lead us not into temptation \"[fn-19-P1940_574193:8-nf] (now what greater temptation is there than persecution?), we acknowledge that that comes to pass by His will whom we beseech to exempt us from it. For this is what follows, \"But deliver us from the wicked one,\" that is, do not lead us into temptation by giving us up to the wicked one, for then are we delivered from the power of the devil, when we are not handed over to him to be tempted. Nor would the devil's legion have had power over the herd of swine[fn-19-P1941_574668:9-nf] unless they had got it from God; so far are they from having power over the sheep of God. I may say that the bristles of the swine, too, were then counted by God, not to speak of the hairs of holy men. The devil, it must be owned, seems indeed to have power-in this case really his own-over those who do not belong to God, the nations being once for all counted by God as a drop of the bucket, and as the dust of the threshing-floor, and as the spittle of the mouth, and so thrown open to the devil as, in a sense, a free possession. But against those who belong to the household of God he may not do ought as by any right of his own, because the cases marked out in Scripture show when-that is, for what reasons-he may touch them. For either, with a view to their being approved, the power of trial is granted to him, challenged or challenging, as in the instances already referred to, or, to secure an opposite result, the sinner is handed over to him, as though he were an executioner to whom belonged the inflicting of punishment, as in the case of Saul. \"And the Spirit of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled and stifled him; \"[fn-19-P1942_575871:10-nf] or the design is to humble, as the apostle tells us, that there was given him a stake, the messenger of Satan, to buffet him;[fn-19-P1943_576019:11-nf] and even this son of thing is not permitted in the case of holy men, unless it be that at the same time strength of endurance may be perfected in weakness. For the apostle likewise delivered Phygellus and Hermogenes over to Satan that by chastening they might be taught not to blaspheme.[fn-19-P1944_576327:12-nf] You see, then, that the devil receives more suitably power even from the servants of God; so far is he from having it by any fight of his own.","title":"IX.

I suppose, however, that it will become apparent in the subsequent details of these proceedings. Now he says: \"We have affirmed that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep the commandments of God if he wishes, inasmuch as God has given him this ability. But we have not said that any man can be found, who from infancy to old age has never committed sin; but that if any person were converted from his sins, he could by his own exertion and God's grace be without sin; and yet not even thus would he be incapable of change afterwards.\" Now it is quite uncertain what he means in these words by the grace of God; and the judges, catholic as they were, could not possibly understand by the phrase anything else than the grace which is so very strongly recommended to us in the apostle's teaching. Now this is the grace whereby we hope that we can be delivered from the body of this death through our Lord Jesus Christ,[fn-29-P2909_1129529:48-nf] [VII.] and for the obtaining of which we pray that we may not be led into temptation.[fn-29-P2910_1129637:49-nf] This grace is not nature, but that which renders assistance to frail and corrupted nature. This grace is not the knowledge of the law, but is that of which the apostle says: \"I will not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.\"[fn-29-P2911_1129938:50-nf] Therefore it is not \"the letter that killeth, but the life-giving spirit.\"[fn-29-P2912_1130031:51-nf] For the knowledge of the law, without the grace of the Spirit, produces all kinds of concupiscence in man; for, as the apostle says, \"I had not known sin but by the law: I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.\"[fn-29-P2913_1130379:52-nf] By saying this, however, he blames not the law; he rather praises it, for he says afterwards: \"The law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\"[fn-29-P2914_1130566:53-nf] And he goes on to ask: \"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-29-P2915_1130748:54-nf] And, again, he praises the law by saying: \"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I know not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.\"[fn-29-P2916_1131049:55-nf] Observe, then, he knows the law, praises it, and consents to it; for what it commands, that he also wishes; and what it forbids, and condemns, that he also hates: but for all that, what he hates, that he actually does. There is in his mind, therefore, a knowledge of the holy law of God, but still his evil concupiscence is not cured. He has a good will within him, but still what he does is evil. Hence it comes to pass that, amidst the mutual struggles of the two laws within him,-\"the law in his members warring against the law of his mind, and making him captive to the law of sin,\"[fn-29-P2917_1131658:56-nf] -he confesses his misery; and exclaims in such words as these: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?

Touching the second, however, of these points, we ought to pay careful attention to what he said in answer to the charge against him. \"Concerning the fact, indeed,\" says he, \"that before the Lord's coming there were persons without sin, we now again assert that previous to Christ's advent some men lived holy and righteous lives, according to the teaching of the sacred Scriptures.\" He did not dare to say: \"We now again assert that previous to Christ's advent there were persons without sin,\" although this had been laid to his charge after the very words of Coelestius. For he perceived how dangerous such a statement was, and into what trouble it would bring him. So he reduced the sentence to these harmless dimensions: \"We again assert that before the coming of Christ there were persons who led holy and righteous lives.\" Of course there were: who would deny it? But to say this is a very different thing from saying that they lived \"without sin.\" Because, indeed, those ancient worthies lived holy and righteous lives, they could for that very reason better confess: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-29-P2956_1145287:74-nf] In the present day, also, many men live holy and righteous lives; but yet it is no untruth they utter when in their prayer they say: \"Forgive us our debts, even as we forgive our debtors.\"[fn-29-P2957_1145494:75-nf] This avowal was accordingly acceptable to the judges, in the sense in which Pelagius solemnly declared his belief; but certainly not in the sense which Coelestius, according to the original charge against him, was said to hold.

We might apply the same illustration in answer to our present opponents, unless indeed they would have the Church consist only of good men, whom they assert to be without any sin whatever, that so the Church might be without spot or wrinkle. If this be their meaning, then I repeat the same words as I quoted just now; for how can they be members of the Church, of whom the voice of a truthful humility declares, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-29-P2961_1146764:76-nf] or how could the Church offer up that prayer which the Lord taught her to use, \"Forgive us our debts,\"[fn-29-P2962_1146885:77-nf] if in this world the Church is without a spot or blemish?

How, indeed, can this word fail to contradict the very defence and answer which Pelagius made; since the Bishop John asserted that Pelagius put in this answer in his presence, that \"he wished it to be understood that the man who was willing to labour and agonize for his salvation was able to avoid sin,\" while Pelagius himself, at this time engaged in a formal inquiry anti conducting his defence,[fn-31-P3118_1209362:148-nf] said, that \"it was by his own labour and the grace of God that a man is able to be without sin?\" Now, is a thing easy when labour is required to effect it? For I suppose that every man would agree with us in the opinion, that wherever there is labour there cannot be facility. And yet a carnal epistle of windiness and inflation flies forth, and, outrunning in speed the tardy record of the proceedings, gets first into men's hands; so as to assert that fourteen bishops in the East have determined, not only \"that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep God's commandments,\" but \"easily to keep.\" Nor is God's assistance once named: it is merely said, \"If he wishes;\" so that, of course, as nothing is affirmed of the divine grace, for which the earnest fight was made, it remains that the only thing one reads of in this epistle is the unhappy and self-deceiving-because represented as victorious-human pride. As if the Bishop John, indeed, had not expressly declared that he censured this statement, and that, by the help of three inspired texts of Scripture,[fn-31-P3119_1210564:149-nf] he had, as if by thunderbolts, struck to the ground the gigantic mountains of such presumption which they had piled up against the still over-towering heights of heavenly grace; or as if again those other bishops who were John's assessors could have borne with Pelagius, either in mind or even in ear, when he pronounced these words: \"We said that a man is able to be without sin and to keep the commandments of God, if he wishes,\" unless he had gone on at once to say: \"For the ability to do this God has given to him\" (for they were unaware that he was speaking of nature, and not of that grace which they had learnt from the teaching of the apostle); and had afterwards added this qualification: \"We never said, however, that any man could be found, who at no time whatever from his infancy to his old age had committed sin, but that if any person were converted from his sins, he could by his own exertion and the grace of God be without sin.\" Now, by the very fact that in their sentence they used these words, \"he has answered correctly,'that a man can, when he has the assistance and grace of God, be without sin;'\" what else did they fear than that, if he denied this, he would be doing a manifest wrong not to man's ability, but to God's grace? It has indeed not been defined when a man may become without sin; it has only been judicially settled, that this result can only be reached by the assisting grace of God; it has not, I say, been defined whether a man, whilst he is in this flesh which lusts against the Spirit, ever has been, or now is, or ever can be, by his present use of reason and free will, either in the full society of man or in monastic solitude, in such a state as to be beyond the necessity of offering up the prayer, not in behalf of others, but for himself personally: \"Forgive us our debts;\"[fn-31-P3120_1212412:150-nf] or whether this gift shall be consummated at the time when \"we shall be like Him, when we shall see Him as He is,\"[fn-31-P3121_1212548:151-nf] -when it shall be said, not by those that are fighting: \"I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,\"[fn-31-P3122_1212697:152-nf] but by those that are triumphing: \"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?\"[fn-31-P3123_1212814:153-nf] Now, this is perhaps hardly a question which ought to be discussed between catholics and heretics, but only among catholics with a view to a peaceful settlement.[fn-31-P3124_1212998:154-nf] ","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"But is it so, that God the Father, from whom is born the Word that is God of God,-is it so, then, that God the Father, in respect to that wisdom which He is to Himself, has learned some things by His bodily senses, and others by Himself? Who could say this, who thinks of God, not as a rational animal, but as One above the rational soul? So far at least as He can be thought of, by those who place Him above all animals and all souls, although they see Him by conjecture through a glass and in an enigma, not yet face to face as He is. Is it that God the Father has learned those very things which He knows, not by the body, for He has none, but by Himself, from elsewhere from some one? or has stood in need of messengers or witnesses that He might know them? Certainly not; since His own perfection enables Him to know all things that He knows. No doubt He has messengers, viz. the angels; but not to announce to Him things that He knows not, for there is nothing He does not know. But their good lies in consulting the truth about their own works. And This it is which is meant by saying that they bring Him word of some things, not that He may learn of them, but they of Him by His word without bodily sound. They bring Him word, too, of that which He wills, being sent by Him to whomever He wills, and hearing all from Him by that word of His, i.e. finding in His truth what themselves are to do: what, to whom, and when, they are to bring word. For we too pray to Him, yet do not informHim what our necessities are. \"For your Father knoweth,\" says His Word, \"what things ye have need of, before you ask Him.\"[fn-20-P2002_1014392:54-nf] Nor did He become acquainted with them, so as to know them, at any definite time; but He knew beforehand, without any beginning, all things to come in time, and among them also both what we should ask of Him, and when; and to whom He would either listen or not listen, and on what subjects. And with respect to all His creatures, both spiritual and corporeal, He does not know them because they are, but they are because He knows them. For He was not ignorant of what He was about to create; therefore He created because He knew; He did not know because He created. Nor did He know them when created in any other way than He knew them when still to be created, for nothing accrued to His wisdom from them; but that wisdom remained as it was, while they came into existence as it was fitting and when it was fitting. So, too, it is written in the book of Ecclesiasticus: \"All things are known to Him ere ever they were created: so also after they were perfected.\"[fn-20-P2003_1015373:55-nf] \"So,\" he says, not otherwise; so were they known to Him, both ere ever they were created, and after they were perfected. This knowledge, therefore, is far unlike our knowledge. And the knowledge of God is itself also His wisdom, and His wisdom is itself His essence or substance. Because in the marvellous simplicity of that nature, it is not one thing to be wise and another to be, but to be wise is to be; as wehave often said already also in the earlier books. But our knowledge is in most things capable both of being lost and of being recovered, because to us to be is not the same as to know or to be wise; since it is possible for us to be, even although we know not, neither are wise in that which we have learned from elsewhere. Therefore, as our knowledge is unlike that knowledge of God, so is our word also, which is born from our knowledge, unlike that Word of God which is born from the essence of the Father. And this is as if I should say, born from the Father's knowledge, from the Father's wisdom; or still more exactly, from the Father who is knowledge, from the Father who is wisdom.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"159","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"104.

For well do I know that even from the few things that have been said you will embrace it with much zeal. But since it is also necessary to make clear and manifest the apostolic saying which has been to-day read; seeming as it does to many to afford a pretext for indolence; so that some may not, providing for themselves hence a certain frigid defence, neglect their own salvation-to this let us direct our discourse. What then is this saying? \"Whether in pretence,\" it says, \"or in sincerity,[fn-8-P840_555507:12-nf] Christ is preached.\"[fn-8-P841_555590:13-nf] This many wrest absolutely[fn-8-P842_555638:14-nf] and just as happens, without reading what precedes and what comes after it; but having cut it off from the sequence of the remaining members, to the destruction of their own soul they put it forward to the more indolent. For attempting to seduce them from the sound faith; then seeing them afraid and trembling; on the ground of its not being without danger to do this,[fn-8-P843_556065:15-nf] and desiring to relieve their fears, they bring forward this apostolic declaration, saying, Paul conceded this, by saying, \"Whether in pretence or in sincerity, let Christ be proclaimed.\" But these things are not (true), they are not. For in the first place he did not say \"let him be proclaimed,\" but \"he is proclaimed,\" and the difference between this and that is wide. For the saying \"let him be proclaimed\" belongs to a lawgiver; but the saying \"he is proclaimed\" to one announcing the event. For that Paul does not ordain a law that there should be heresies, but draws away all who attended to him, hear what he says, \"If any one preaches to you a gospel besides what ye have received, let him be anathema, were it even I, were it even an angel from the heavens.\"[fn-8-P844_556958:16-nf] Now he would not have anamethized both himself and an angel, if he had known the act to be without danger. And again- \"I am jealous of you with a jealousy of God,\" he says; \"for I have betrothed you to one husband a chaste virgin: and fear lest at some time, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his wiliness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the singleness that is towards Christ.\"[fn-8-P845_557364:17-nf] See, he both set down singleness, and granted no allowance.

But every liar says the opposite of what he thinks in his heart, with purpose to deceive. Now it is evident that speech was given to man, not that men might therewith deceive one another, but that one man might make known his thoughts to another. To use speech, then, for the purpose of deception, and not for its appointed end, is a sin. Nor are we to suppose that there is any lie that is not a sin, because it is sometimes possible, by telling a lie, to do service to another. For it is possible to do this by theft also, as when we steal from a rich man who never feels the loss, to give to a poor man who is sensibly benefited by what he gets. And the same can be said of adultery also, when, for instance, some woman appears likely to die of love unless we consent to her wishes, while if she lived she might purify herself by repentance; but yet no one will assert that on this account such an adultery is not a sin. And if we justly place so high a value upon chastity, what offense have we taken at truth, that, while no prospect of advantage to another will lead us to violate the former by adultery, we should be ready to violate the latter by lying?

Lest any one should flatter himself that he is innocent,[fn-72-P7213_2366972:59-nf] and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his sins.

For though it exercises authority, the vices do not submit without a struggle. For however well one maintains the conflict, and however thoroughly he has subdued these enemies, there steals in some evil thing, which, if it does not find ready expression in act, slips out by the lips, or insinuates itself into the thought; and therefore his peace is not full so long as he is at war with his vices. For it is a doubtful conflict he wages with those that resist, and his victory over those that are defeated is not secure, but full of anxiety and effort. Amidst these temptations, therefore, of all which it has been summarily said in the divine oracles, \"Is not human life upon earth a temptation?\"[fn-37-P3758_2073287:52-nf] who but a proud man can presume that he so lives that he has no need to say to God, \"Forgive us our debts?\" And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed up with vanity, and is justly resisted by Him who abundantly gives grace to the humble. Whence it is said, \"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.\"[fn-37-P3759_2073630:53-nf] In this, then, consists the righteousness of a man, that he submit himself to God, his body to his soul, and his vices, even when they rebel, to his reason, which either defeats or at least resists them; and also that he beg from God grace to do his duty,[fn-37-P3760_2073916:54-nf] and the pardon of his sins, and that he render to God thanks for all the blessings he receives. But, in that final peace to which all our righteousness has reference, and for the sake of which it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound immortality and incorruption, and shall have no more vices, and as we shall experience no resistance either from ourselves or from others, it will not be necessary that reason should rule vices which no longer exist, but God shall rule the man, and the soul shall rule the body, with a sweetness and facility suitable to the felicity of a life which is done with bondage.

For instance, in this case of Saul, the Creator, who had made no mistake in selecting him for the kingdom, and endowing him with His Holy Spirit, makes a statement respecting the goodliness of his person, how that He had most fitly chosen him as being at that moment the choicest man, so that (as He says) there was not his fellow among the children of Israel.[fn-46-P4644_1487046:300-nf] Neither was He ignorant how he would afterwards turn out.

In accordance with which He declared, \"I create evil,\"[fn-46-P4654_1489219:310-nf] and, \"I frame evil against you; \"[fn-46-P4655_1489273:311-nf] meaning not to sinful evils, but avenging ones. What sort of stigma[fn-46-P4656_1489364:312-nf] pertains to these, congruous as they are with God's judicial character, we have sufficiently explained.[fn-46-P4657_1489485:313-nf] Now although these are called \"evils,\" they are yet not reprehensible in a judge; nor because of this their name do they show that the judge is evil: so in like manner will this particular evil[fn-46-P4658_1489725:314-nf] be understood to be one of this class of judiciary evils, and along with them to be compatible with (God as) a judge. The Greeks also sometimes[fn-46-P4659_1489940:315-nf] use the word \"evils\" for troubles and injuries (not malignant ones), as in this passage of yours[fn-46-P4660_1490186:316-nf] is also meant. Therefore, if the Creator repented of such evil as this, as showing that the creature deserve decondemnation, and ought to be punished for his sin, then, in[fn-46-P4661_1490383:317-nf] the present instance no fault of a criminating nature will be imputed to the Creator, for having deservedly and worthily decreed the destruction of a city so full of iniquity. What therefore He had justly decreed, having no evil purpose in His decree, He decreed from the principle of justice,[fn-46-P4662_1490695:318-nf] not from malevolence. Yet He gave it the name of \"evil,\" because of the evil and desert involved in the very suffering itself. Then, you will say, if you excuse the evil under name of justice, on the ground that He had justly determined destruction against the people of Nineveh, He must even on this argument be blameworthy, for having repented of an act of justice, which surely should not be repented of. Certainly not,[fn-46-P4663_1491170:319-nf] my reply is; God will never repent of an act of justice. And it now remains that we should understand what God's repentance means. For although man repents most frequently on the recollection of a sin, and occasionally even from the unpleasantness[fn-46-P4664_1491431:320-nf] of some good action, this is never the case with God. For, inasmuch as God neither commits sin nor condemns a good action, in so far is there no room in Him for repentance of either a good or an evil deed. Now this point is determined for you even in the scripture which we have quoted. Samuel says to Saul, \"The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou; \"[fn-46-P4665_1491888:321-nf] and into two parts shall Israel be divided: \"for He will not turn Himself, nor repent; for He does not repent as a man does.\"[fn-46-P4666_1492036:322-nf] According, therefore, to this definition, the divine repentance takes in all cases a different form from that of man, in that it is never regarded as the result of improvidence or of fickleness, or of any condemnation of a good or an evil work. What, then, will be the mode of God's repentance? It is already quite clear,[fn-46-P4667_1492396:323-nf] if you avoid referring it to human conditions. For it will have no other meaning than a simple change of a prior purpose; and this is admissible without any blame even in a man, much more[fn-46-P4668_1492600:324-nf] in God, whose every purpose is faultless. Now in Greek the word for repentance (meta/noia) is formed, not from the confession of a sin, but from a change of mind, which in God we have shown to be regulated by the occurrence of varying circumstances.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_27_book_xxi","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"I have also met with some who are of opinion that such only as neglect to cover their sins with alms-deeds shall be punished in everlasting fire; and they cite the words of the Apostle James, \"He shall have judgment without mercy who hath shown no mercy.\"[fn-42-P4226_2311964:45-nf] Therefore, say they, he who has not amended his ways, but yet has intermingled his profligate and wicked actions with works of mercy, shall receive mercy in the judgment, so that he shall either quite escape condemnation, or shall be liberated from his doom after some time shorter or longer.

If you dread and fear, lest, if you begin to act thus abundantly, your patrimony being exhausted with your liberal dealing, you may perchance be reduced to poverty; be of good courage in this respect, be free from care: that cannot be exhausted whence the service of Christ is supplied, whence the heavenly work is celebrated. Neither do I vouch for this on my own authority; but I promise it on the faith of the Holy Scriptures, and on the authority of the divine promise. The Holy Spirit speaks by Solomon, and says, \"He that giveth unto the poor shall never lack, but he that turneth away his eye shall be in great poverty; \"[fn-75-P7515_2503363:29-nf] showing that the merciful and those who do good works cannot want, but rather that the sparing and barren hereafter come to want.

And the Lord in the Gospel, already considering the hearts of men of this kind, and with prescient voice denouncing faithless and unbelieving men, bears witness, and says: \"Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For these things the Gentiles seek. And your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

There is then evil, which is really evil; fornication, adultery, covetousness, and the countless dreadful things, which are worthy of the utmost reproach and punishment. Again there is evil, which rather is not evil, but is called so, famine, pestilence, death, disease, and others of a like kind. For these would not be evils. On this account I said they are called so only. Why then? Because, were they evils, they would not have become the sources of good to us, chastening our pride, goading our sloth, and leading us on to zeal, making us more attentive. \"For when,\" saith one, \"he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned, and came early to God.\"[fn-10-P1016_680509:17-nf] He calls this evil therefore which chastens them, which makes them purer, which renders them more zealous, which leads them on to love of wisdom; not that which comes under suspicion and is worthy of reproach; for that is not a work of God, but an invention of our own will, but this is for the destruction of the other. He calls then by the name of evil the affliction, which arises from our punishment; thus naming it not in regard to its own nature, but according to that view which men take of it. For since we are accustomed to call by the name of evil, not only thefts and adulteries, but also calamities; so he has called the matter, according to the estimate of mankind. This then is that which the prophet saith \"There is no evil in the city which the Lord hath not done.\" This too by means of Isaiah God has made clear saying \"I am God who maketh peace and createth evil,\"[fn-10-P1017_681415:18-nf] again naming calamities evils. This evil also Christ hints at, thus saying to the disciples, \"sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,\"[fn-10-P1018_681574:19-nf] that is to say the affliction, the misery. It is manifest then on all sides, that he here calls punishment evil; and himself brings these upon us, affording us the greatest view of his providence. For the physician is not only to be commended when he leads forth the patient into gardens and meadows, nor even into baths and pools of water, nor yet when he sets before him a well furnished table, but when he orders him to remain without food, when he oppresses him with hunger and lays him low with thirst, confines him to his bed, both making his house a prison, and depriving him of the very light, and shadowing his room on all sides with curtains, and when he cuts, and when he cauterizes, and when he brings his bitter medicines, he is equally a physician. How is it not then preposterous to call him a physician who does so many evil things, but to blaspheme God, if at any time He doeth one of these things, if He bring on either famine or death, and to reject his providence over all? And yet He is the only true physician both of souls and bodies. On this account He often seizes this nature of ours wantoning in prosperity, and travailing with a fever of sins, and by want, and hunger, and death and other calamities and the rest of the medicines of which He knows, frees us from diseases. But the poor alone feel hunger, says one. But He does not chasten with hunger alone, but with countless other things. Him who is in poverty He has often corrected with hunger, but the rich and him who enjoys prosperity, with dangers, diseases, untimely deaths. For He is full of resources, and the medicines which He has for our salvation are manifold.","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":6,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_28_concerning_faith_of_things_not_seen","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6.

When the apostle calls himself a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, this is the new honey. But when he adds, \"which He promised before by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures of His Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,\"[fn-16-P1615_883682:3-nf] this is the old vinegar.

Do you wish that I shall speak of the ways of repentance? They are many, and various, and different, and all lead to heaven. The first way of repentance is condemnation of sins. \"Declare thou first thy sins that thou mayest be justified.\"[fn-10-P1066_720150:19-nf] Wherefore also the prophet said \"I said, I will speak out, my transgression to the Lord, and thou remittedst the iniquity of my heart.\"[fn-10-P1067_720309:20-nf] Condemn thyself therefore for thy sins. This is enough for the Master by way of self-defence. For he who condemns his sins, is slower to fall into them again. Awake thy conscience, that inward accuser, in order that thou mayest have no accuser at the judgment seat of the Lord. This is one way of repentance, the best; and there is another not less than this, not to bear a grudge against thine enemies to overcome anger, to forgive the sins of our fellow-servants. For so will those which have been done against the master be forgiven us. See the second expiation of sins: \"For if ye forgive\" saith he, \"your debtors, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.\"[fn-10-P1068_720994:21-nf] Dost thou wish to learn a third way of repentance? Fervent and diligent prayer, and to do this from the bottom of the heart. Hast thou not seen that widow, how she persuaded the shameless judge?[fn-10-P1069_721209:22-nf] But thou hast a gentle Master, both tender, and kind. She asked, against her adversaries, but thou dost not ask against thine adversaries, but on behalf of thine own salvation. And if thou wouldest learn a fourth way, I will say almsgiving. For this has a great power and unspeakable. For Daniel saith to Nebuchadnezzar when he had come to all kinds of evil, and had entered upon all impiety, \"O King let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, redeem thy sins by almsgiving and thine iniquities by compassion on the poor.\"[fn-10-P1070_721750:23-nf] What could be compared with this lovingkindness? After countless sins, after so many transgressions, he is promised that he will be reconciled with him he has come into conflict with if he will show kindness to his own fellow-servants. And modesty, and humility, not less than all words spoken, exhaust the nature of sins. And the publican is proof, being unable to declare his good deeds, in sight of all, bringing forward his humility, and laying aside the heavy burden of his sins.[fn-10-P1071_722254:24-nf] See we have shewn five ways of repentance: first the condemnation of sins, next the forgiveness of our neighbours' sins, thirdly that which comes of prayer, fourth that which comes of almsgiving, fifth that which comes of humility. Do not thou then be lazy; but walk in all these day by day. For the ways are easy, nor canst thou plead poverty. And even if thou livest poorer than all, thou art able to leave thine anger, and be humble, and to pray fervently, and to condemn sins, and thy poverty is in no way a hindrance. And why do I speak thus, when not even in that way of repentance in which it is possible to spend money (I speak of almsgiving), not even there is poverty any hindrance to us from obeying the command? The widow who spent the two mites is a proof.[fn-10-P1072_723046:25-nf] Having learned then the healing of our wounds, let us constantly apply these medicines, in order that we may return to health and enjoy the sacred table with assurance; and with much glory, reach Christ the king of glory, and attain to everlasting good by the grace, and compassion, and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom be glory, power, honour, to the Father, together with the all holy, and good and quickening Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever.

For every one is tempted,\" saith the Apostle James, \"being drawn away and enticed by his own lust.\"[fn-36-P3652_1724851:61-nf] And against this fault there is sought the help of medicine from Him, Who can heal all such sicknesses, not by the removal of a nature that is alien from us, but in the renewal of our own nature. Whence also the above-mentioned Apostle saith not, \"Every one is tempted\" by lust, but added, \"by his own:\" that he who hears this may understand, how he ought to cry, \"I said, Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-36-P3653_1725315:62-nf] For it would not have needed healing, had it not corrupted[fn-36-P3654_1725391:63-nf] itself by sinning, so that its own flesh should lust against it, that is, itself should be opposed to itself, on that side, wherein in the flesh it was made sick.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"25. But, say they, how is the flesh by a certain likeness compared unto the Church? What! doth the Church lust against Christ? whereas the same Apostle said, \"The Church is subject unto Christ.\"[fn-36-P3690_1741741:92-nf] Clearly the Church is subject unto Christ; because the spirit therefore lusteth against the flesh, that on every side the Church may be made subject to Christ; but the flesh lusteth against the spirit, because not as yet hath the Church received that peace which was promised perfect. And for this reason the Church is made subject unto Christ for the pledge of salvation, and the flesh lusteth against the spirit from the weakness of sickness. For neither were those other than members of the Church, unto whom he thus spake, \"Walk in the spirit, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed the one to the other; that ye do not what we would.\"[fn-36-P3691_1742498:93-nf] These things were assuredly spoken unto the Church, which if it were not made subject unto Christ, the spirit would not in it lust against the flesh through continence. By reason of which they were indeed able not to perfect the lusts of the flesh, but through the flesh lusting against the Spirit they were not able to do the things which they would, that is, not even to have the very lusts of the flesh. Lastly, why should we not confess that in spiritual men the Church is subject unto Christ, but in carnal men yet lusteth against Christ? Did not they lust against Christ unto whom it was said, \"Is Christ divided?\"[fn-36-P3692_1743141:94-nf] and, \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. I have given unto yon milk to drink as unto babes in Christ, not meat, for ye were not as yet able; but not even now are ye able: for ye are still carnal. For whereas there is among you emulation, and strife, are ye not carnal?\"[fn-36-P3693_1743461:95-nf] Against whom doth emulation and strife lust, but against Christ? For these lusts of the flesh Christ healeth in His own, but loveth in none. Whence the holy Church, so long as it hath such members, is not yet without spot or wrinkle. To these are added those other sins also, for which the daily cry of the whole Church is, \"Forgive us our debts:\"[fn-36-P3694_1743835:96-nf] and, that we should not think spiritual persons exempt from these, not any one soever of carnal persons, nor any one soever of spiritual persons themselves, but he, who lay on the breast of the Lord,[fn-36-P3695_1744054:97-nf] and whom He loved before others, saith, \"If we shall say that we have not sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-36-P3696_1744204:98-nf] But in every sin, more in what is greater, less in what is less, there is an act of lust against righteousness. And of Christ it is written: \"Who was made unto us by God, Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.\"[fn-36-P3697_1744457:99-nf] In every sin therefore without doubt there is an act of lust against Christ. But when He, Who \"healeth all our sicknesses,\"[fn-36-P3698_1744601:100-nf] a shall have led His Church unto the promised healing of sickness, then in none of its members shall there be any, even the very least spot or wrinkle. Then in no way shall the flesh lust against the spirit, and therefore there shall be no cause why the spirit also lust against the flesh. Then all this conflict shall come to an end, then there shall be the highest concord of both substances; then to such a degree shall no one there be carnal, that even the flesh itself shall be spiritual. What therefore each one living after Christ doth with his flesh, whereas he both lusts against its evil lust, which he restrains, hereafter to be healed, which he holds, not yet healed; and yet nourisheth and cherisheth its good nature, since \"no one ever hated his own flesh,\"[fn-36-P3699_1745393:101-nf] this also Christ doth with the Church, so far as it is lawful to compare lesser with greater matters. For He both represses it with rebukes, that it burst not being puffed up with impunity; and raises it up with consolations, that it sink not being weighed down with infirmity. Hence is that of the Apostle, \"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are rebuked of the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.\"[fn-37-P3700_1745874:102-nf] And that in the Psalm, \"After the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have gladdened my soul.\"[fn-37-P3701_1746012:103-nf] We are therefore then to hope for perfect soundness of our flesh without any opposition, when there shall be sure security of the Church of Christ without any fear.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_29_homily_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"\"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.\"[fn-24-P2460_815426:45-nf] ","title":"Homily XXIII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":6,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_31_book_i_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"Learn,\" says he, \"for, behold the apostleteaches you.\" Yes, indeed, I will learn, if the apostle teaches; since it is God alone who teaches by the apostle. But, pray, what is itwhich the apostle teaches? \"Behold,\" he adds, \"how, when speaking to the men of Athens, he strongly set forth this truth, saying: `Seeing He giveth to all life and spirit.'\" Well, who thinks of denying this? \"But understand,\" he says, \"what it is the apostle states: He giveth; not, He hath given. He refers us to continuous and indefinite time, and does not proclaim past and completed time. Now that which he gives without cessation, He is always giving; just as He who gives is Himself ever existent.\" I have quoted his words precisely as I found them in the second of the books which you sent me. First, I beg you to notice to what lengths he has gone, while endeavouring to affirm what he knows nothing about. For he has dared to say, that God, without any cessation, and not merely in the present time, but for ever and ever, gives souls to persons when they are born. \"He is always giving,\" says he, \"just as He who gives is Himself ever existent.\" Far be it from me to say that I do not understand what the apostle said, for it is plain enough. But what this man says, he even ought himself to know, is contrary to the Christian faith; and he should be on his guard against going any further in such assertions. For, of course, when the dead shall rise again, there will be no more persons to be born; therefore God will bestow no longer any souls at any birth; but those which He is now giving to men along with their bodies He will judge. So that He is not always giving, although He is ever existent, who at present is giving. Nor, indeed, is that at all derivable from the apostle's expression, who giveth (not hath given), which this writer wishes to deduce, namely, that God does not give men souls by propagation. For souls are still given by Him, even if it be by propagation; even as bodily endowments, such as limbs, and sensations, and shape, and, in fact, the whole substance, are given by God Himself to human beings, although it be by propagation that He gives them. Nor again, because the Lord says,[fn-45-P4560_1744387:34-nf] \"If God so clothes the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven\" (not using the preterite time, hath clothed, as when He first formed the material; but employing the present form, clothes, which, indeed, He still is doing), shall we on that account say, that the lilies are not produced from the original source of their own kind. What, therefore, if the soul and spirit of a human being in like manner is given by God Himself, whenever it is given; and given, too, by propagation from its own kind? Now this is a position which I neither maintain nor refute. Nevertheless, if it must be defended or confuted, I certainly recommend its being done by clear, and not doubtful proofs. Nor do I deserve to be compared with senseless cattle because I avow myself to be as yet incapable of determining the question, but rather with cautious persons, because I do not recklessly teach what I know nothing about. But I am not disposed on my own part to return railing for railing and compare this man with brutes; but I warn him as a son to acknowledge that he is really ignorant of that which he knows nothing about; nor to attempt to teach that which he has not yet learnt, lest he should deserve to be compared with those persons whom the apostle mentions as \"desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm.\"[fn-45-P4561_1745791:35-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_25_book_iii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"174","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"127.

Nor can you say that you honor God with sacrifices in the shape of pure and simple prayers: for, in your low, dishonoring notions about the divine nature and substance, you make your god to be the victim in the sacrifices of Pagans; so far are you from pleasing the true God with your sacrifices. For you hold that God is confined not only in trees and plants, or in the human body, but also in the flesh of animals, which contaminates Him with its impurity. And how can your soul give praise to God, when you actually reproach Him by calling your soul a particle of His substance taken captive by the race of darkness; as if God could not maintain the conflict except by this corruption of His members, and this dishonorable captivity? Instead of honoring God in your prayers, you insult Him. For what sin did you commit, when you belonged to Him, that you should be thus punished by the god you cry to, not because you left Him sinfully of your own: choice; for he himself gave you to His enemies, to obtain peace for His kingdom? You are not even given as hostages to be honorably guarded. Nor is it as when a shepherd lays a snare to catch a wild beast: for he does not put one of his own members in the snare, but some animal from his flock; and generally, so that the wild beast is caught before the animal is hurt. You, though you are the members of your god, are given to the enemy, whose ferocity you keep off from your god only by being contaminated with their impurity, infected with their corruptions, without any fault of your own. You cannot in your prayers use the words: \"Free us, O Lord, for the glory of Thy name; and for Thy name's sake pardon our sins.\"[fn-19-P1949_1126690:11-nf] Your prayer is: \"Free us by Thy skill, for we suffer here oppression, and torture, and pollution, only that Thou mayest mourn unmolested in Thy kingdom.\" These are words of reproach, not of entreaty. Nor can you use the words taught us by the Master of truth: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\"[fn-19-P1950_1127020:12-nf] For who are the debtors who have sinned against you? If it is the race of darkness, you do not forgive their debts, but make them be utterly cast out and shut up in eternal imprisonment. And how can God forgive your debts, when He rather sinned against you by sending you into such a state, than you against Him, whom you obeyed by going? If this was not a sin in Him, because He was compelled to do it, this excuse must apply you, now that you have been overthrown in the conflict, more than to Him before the conflict began. You suffer now from the mixture of evil, which was not the case with Him when nevertheless He was compelled to send you. So either He requires that you should forgive Him his debt; or, if He is not in debt to you, still less are you to Him.

However, that you may have a very manifest proof that on the one hand the kingdom of heaven must not be parcelled out to the baptized, and other portions of the kingdom of God be given to the unbaptized, as you seem to have determined, I beg of you to hear the Lord's own words; He does not say, \"Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom or heaven;\" but His words are, \"he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" His discourse with Nicodemus on the subject before us runs thus: \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Observe, He does not here say, the kingdom of heaven, but the kingdom of God. And then, on Nicodemus asking Him in reply, \"How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?\" the Lord, in explanation, repeats His former statement more plainly and openly: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" Observe again, He uses the same phrase, the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of heaven.[fn-47-P4792_1868610:15-nf] It is worthy of remark, that while He varies two expressions in explaining them the second time (for after saying, \"Except a man be born again,\" He interprets that by the fuller expression, \"Except a man be born of water and the Spirit;\" and in like manner He explains, \"he cannot see,\" by the completer phrase, \"he cannot enter into\"), He yet makes no variation here; He said \"the kingdom of God\" the first time, and He afterwards repeated the same phrase exactly. It is not now necessary to raise and discuss the question, whether the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven must be understood as involving different senses, or whether only one thing is described under two designations. It is enough to find that no one can enter into the kingdom of God, except he be washed in the laver of regeneration. I suppose you perceive by this time how wide of the truth it is to separate from the kingdom of God any mansions that are placed in the house of God. And as to the idea which you have entertained that there will be found dwelling among the various mansions, which the Lord has told us abound in His Father's house, some who have not been born again of water and the Spirit, I advise you, if you will permit me, not to defer amending it, in order that you may hold the catholic faith.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_34_on_the_good_of_widowhood","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"21. These things I am compelled to admonish by reason of certain little discourses of some men, that are to be shunned and avoided, which have begun to steal through the ears unto the minds of many, being (as must be said with tears) hostile to the grace of Christ, which go to persuade that we count not as necessary for us prayer unto the Lord, that we enter not into temptation. For they so essay to defend the free will of man, as that by it alone, even without help of the grace of God, we are able to fulfill what is commanded us of God. And thus it follows, that the Lord in vain said, \"Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation;\"[fn-42-P4202_1988878:49-nf] and in vain daily in the Lord's Prayer itself we say, \"Lead us not into temptation.\"[fn-42-P4203_1988984:50-nf] For if it is of our own power alone that we be not overcome by temptation, why do we pray that we enter not, nor be led into it? Rather let us do what is of our own free will, and most absolute power; and let us mock at the Apostle, saying, \"God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able;\"[fn-42-P4204_1989325:51-nf] and let us oppose him, and say, Why seek I of the Lord, what He hath set in my own power? But far be it, that he be so minded, who is sound minded. Wherefore let us seek that He may give, what He bids us that we have. For to this end He bids us have this, which as yet we have not, to admonish as what to seek; and that when we shall have found the power to do what He hath bidden, we may understand, of this also, whence we have received it; lest, being puffed and lifted up by the spirit of this world, we know not what things have been given unto us of God. Wherefore the free choice of the human will we by no means destroy, when the Grace of God, by which the free choice itself is helped, we deny not with ungrateful pride, but rather set forth with grateful piety. For it is ours to will: but the will itself is both admonished that it may arise, and healed, that it may have power;[fn-42-P4205_1990235:52-nf] and enlarged, that it may receive; and filled, that it may have. For were not we to will, certainly neither should we receive the things that are given, nor should we have. For who would have continence, (among the rest of the gifts of God to speak of this rather, of which I am speaking to you,) who, I say, would have continence, unless willing? forasmuch as also no one would receive unless willing. But if you ask, Whose gift it is, that it can be by our will received and had? listen to Scripture; yea, rather, because thou knowest, recollect what thou hast read, \"Whereas I knew,\" saith he, \"that no one can be continent, unless God give it, and this itself was of wisdom, to know whose gift it was.\"[fn-42-P4206_1990963:53-nf] Great are these two gifts, wisdom and continence; wisdom, forsooth, whereby we are formed in the knowledge of God; but continence, whereby we are not conformed unto this world. But God bids us that we be both wise and continent, without which goods we cannot be just and perfect. But let us praythat He give what He bids, by helping and inspiring, Who hath admonished us what to will by commanding and calling. Whatsoever 'of this He hath given, let us pray that He preserve; but what He hath not given as yet, let us pray that He supply; yet let us pray and give thanks for what we have received; and for what we have not yet received, from the very fact that we are not ungrateful for what we have received, let us trust that we shall receive it. For He, Who hath given power unto the faithful who are married to contain from adulteries and fornications, Himself hath given unto holy virgins and widows to contain from all sexual intercourse; in the case of which virtue now the term inviolate chastity[fn-42-P4207_1991989:54-nf] or continence is properly used. Or is it haply that from Him indeed we have received continence, but from ourselves have wisdom? \"What then is it that the Apostle James saith, \"But if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, Who giveth unto all liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given unto him.\"[fn-42-P4208_1992321:55-nf] But on this question, already in other little works of ours, so far as the Lord hath helped us, we have said many things; and at other times, so far as through Him we shall be able, when opportunity is given, we will speak.","title":"On the Good of Widowhood","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_35_on_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"29.

If one is to be honestly taken in hand, the other must be left alone. Just so, there are these two marriages for our choice, the one effected in the flesh, the other in the spirit; and preoccupation? the one must cause of necessity alienation from the other. No more is the eye able to look at two objects at once; but it must concentrate its special attention on one at a time; no more can the tongue effect utterances in two different languages, so as to pronounce, for instance, a Hebrew word and a Greek word in the same moment: no more can the ear take in at one and the same time a narrative of facts, and a hortatory discourse; if each special tone is heard separately, it will impress its ideas upon the hearers' minds; but if they are combined and so poured into the ear, an inextricable confusion of ideas will be the result, one meaning being mutually lost in the other: and no more, by analogy, do our emotional powers possess a nature which can at once pursue the pleasures of sense and court the spiritual union; nor, besides, can both those ends be gained by the same courses of life; continence, mortification of the passions, scorn of fleshly needs, are the agents of the oneunion; but all that are the reverse of these are the agents of bodily habitation. As, when two masters are before us to choose between, and we cannot be subject to both, for \"no man can serve two masters[fn-28-P2849_1923509:142-nf] ,\" he who is wise will choose the one most useful to himself, so, when two marriages are before us to choose between, and we cannot contract both, for \"he that is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, but he that is married careth for the things of the world[fn-28-P2850_1923799:143-nf] ,\" I repeat that it would be the aim of a sound mind not to miss choosing the more profitable one; and not to be ignorant either of the way which will lead it to this, a way which cannot be learnt but by some such comparison as the following. In the case of a marriage of this world a man who is anxious to avoid appearing altogether insignificant pays the greatest attention both to physical health, and becoming adornment, and amplitude of means and the security from any disgraceful revelations as to his antecedents or his parentage; for so he thinks things will be most likely to turn out as he wishes. Now just in the same way the man who is courting the spiritual alliance will first of all display himself, by the renewal of his mind[fn-28-P2851_1924564:144-nf] , a young man, without a single touch of age upon him; next he will reveal a lineage rich in that in which it is a noble ambition to be rich, not priding himself on worldly wealth, but luxuriating only in the heavenly treasures. As for family distinction, he will not vaunt that which comes by the mere routine of devolution even to numbers of the worthless, but that which is gained by the successful efforts of his own zeal and labours; a distinction which only those can boast of who are \"sons of the light\" and children of God, and are styled \"nobles from the sunrise[fn-28-P2852_1925172:145-nf] \" because of their splendid deeds. Strength and health he will not try to gain by bodily training and feeding, but by all that is the contrary of this, perfecting the spirit's strength in the body's weakness. I could tell also of the suitor's gifts to the bride in such a wedding[fn-28-P2853_1925611:146-nf] ; they are not procured by the money that perishes, but are contributed out of the wealth peculiar to the soul. Would you know their names? You must hear from Paul, that excellent adorner of the Bride[fn-28-P2854_1926046:147-nf] , in what the wealth of those consists who in everything commend themselves. He mentions much else that is priceless in it, and adds, \"in chastity[fn-28-P2855_1926213:148-nf] \"; and besides this all the recognized fruits of the spirit from any quarter whatever are gifts of this marriage. If a man is going to carry out the advice of Solomon and take for helpmate and life-companion that true Wisdom of which he says, \"Love her, and she shall keep thee,\" \"honour her, that she may embrace thee[fn-28-P2856_1926553:149-nf] ,\" then he will prepare himself in a manner worthy of such a love, so as to feast with all the joyous wedding guests in spotless raiment, and not be cast forth, while claiming to sit at that feast, for not having put on the wedding garment. It is plain moreover that the argument applies equally to men and women, to move them towards such a marriage. \"There is neither male nor female[fn-28-P2857_1926959:150-nf] ,\" the Apostle says; \"Christ is all, and in all[fn-28-P2858_1927028:151-nf] \"; and so it is equally reasonable that he who is enamoured of wisdom should hold the Object of his passionate desire, Who is the True Wisdom; and that the soul which cleaves to the undying Bridegroom should have the fruition of her love for the true Wisdom, which is God. We have now sufficiently revealed the nature of the spiritual union, and the Object of the pure and heavenly Love.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":6,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_34_homily_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And what of the covetous man?

But although this is called sin, it is certainly so called not because it is sin, but because it is made by sin, as a writing is said to be some one's \"hand\" because the hand has written it. But they are sins which are unlawfully done, spoken, thought, according to the lust of the flesh, or to ignorance-things which, once done, keep their doers guilty if they are not forgiven. And this very concupiscence of the flesh is in such wise put away in baptism, that although it is inherited by all that are born, it in no respect hurts those that are born anew. And yet from these, if they carnally beget children, it is again derived; and again it will be hurtful to those that are born, unless by the same form it is remitted to them as born again, and remains in them in no way hindering the future life, because its guilt, derived by generation, has been put away by regeneration; and thus it is now no more sin, but is called so, whether because it became what it is by sin, or because it is stirred by the delight of sinning, although by the conquest of the delight of righteousness consent is not given to it. Nor is it on account of this, the guilt of which has already been taken away in the laver of regeneration, that the baptized say in their prayer, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors;\"[fn-51-P5170_2029744:64-nf] but on account of sins which are committed, whether in consentings to it, when what is right is overcome by that which pleases, or when by ignorance evil is accepted as if it were good.

First then, it is to be seen, what is said by persons of that profession, who will not work: then, if we shall find that they think not aright, what is meet to be said for their correction? \"It is not,\" say they, \"of this corporal work in which either husbandmen or handicraftsmen labor, that the Apostle gave precept, when he said, ' If any will not work, neither let him eat.'\" For he could not be contrary to the Gospel, where the Lord Himself saith, \"Therefore I say unto you, be not solicitous for your life, what ye shall eat. neither for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Consider the fowls of heaven, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye rather of more worth than they? But who of you by taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? And concerning raiment, why are ye solicitous? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they labor not, neither spin; but I say unto you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. But if the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, God so clotheth; how much more you, (O ye) of little faith! Be not therefore solicitous, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewithal shall we be clad? for all these things do the Gentiles seek.

Wherefore in that he saith, \"If any will not work, neither let him eat;\" works spiritual, say they, are what we must understand: of which he saith in another place, \"To each one according as the Lord hath given: I have planted, Apollos hath watered; but God gave the increase.\"[fn-45-P4531_2222521:3-nf] And a little after, \"Each one shall receive his reward according to his own labor. We are God's fellow-workers; God's husbandry, God's building are ye: according to the grace which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation.\" As therefore the Apostle worketh in planting, watering, building, and foundation-laying, in that way whoso will not work, let him not eat. For what profiteth in eating spiritually to be fed with the word of God, if he do not thence work others' edification? As that slothful servant, what did it profit to receive a talent and to hide it, and not work for the Lord's gain? Was it that it should be taken from him at last, and himself cast into outer darkness? So, say they, do we also.

For this petition may be understood in many ways, and many things are to be in our thoughts in this petition, when we pray God, \"Thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth.\" As Thy Angels offend Thee not, so may we also not offend Thee.

Will it be called \"day by day,\" when there will be one eternal day? This petition for daily bread is doubtless to be understood in two ways, both for the necessary supply of our bodily food, and for the necessities of our spiritual support. There is a necessary supply of bodily food, for the preservation of our daily life, without which we cannot live. This is food and clothing, but the whole is understood in a part. When we ask for bread, we thereby understand all things.

So then the Eucharist is our daily bread; but let us in such wise receive it, that we be not refreshed in our bodies only, but in our souls. For the virtue which is apprehended there, is unity, that gathered together into His body, and made His members, we may be what we receive. Then will it be indeed our daily bread. Again, what I am handling before you now is \"daily bread;\" and the daily lessons which ye hear in church, are daily bread, and the hymns ye hear and repeat are daily bread.

We read in the book of holy Job, \"Is not the life of man upon earth a temptation?\"[fn-33-P3370_1480050:15-nf] What then do we pray for? Hear what. The Apostle James saith, \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.\"[fn-33-P3371_1480208:16-nf] He spoke of those evil temptations, whereby men are deceived, and brought under the yoke of the devil. This is the kind of temptation he spoke of. For there is another sort of temptation which is called a proving; of this kind of temptation it is written, \"The Lord your God tempteth (proveth) you to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-33-P3372_1480553:17-nf] What means \"to know\"? \"To make you know,\" for He knoweth already. With that kind of temptation, whereby we are deceived and seduced, God tempteth no man. But undoubtedly in His deep and hidden judgment He abandons some. And when He hath abandoned them, the tempter finds his opportunity. For he finds in him no resistance against his power, but forthwith presents himself to him as his possessor, if God abandon him. Therefore that He may not abandon us, do we say, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" \"For every one is tempted,\" says the same Apostle James, \"when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed. Then lust, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.\"[fn-33-P3373_1481288:18-nf] What then has he hereby taught us? To fight against our lusts. For ye are about to put away your sins in Holy Baptism; but lusts will still remain, wherewith ye must fight after that ye are regenerate. For a conflict with your own selves still remains. Let no enemy from without be feared: conquer thine own self, and the whole world is conquered. What can any tempter from without, whether the devil or the devil's minister, do against thee? Whosoever sets the hope of gain before thee to seduce thee, let him only find no covetousness in thee; and what can he who would tempt thee by gain effect? Whereas if covetousness be found in thee, thou takest fire at the sight of gain, and art taken by the bait of this corrupt food.[fn-33-P3374_1482037:19-nf] But if he find no covetousness in thee, the trap remains spread in vain. Or should the tempter set before thee some woman of surpassing beauty; if chastity be within, iniquity from without is overcome. Therefore that he may not take thee with the bait of a strange woman's beauty, fight with thine own lust within; thou hast no sensible perception of thine enemy, but of thine own concupiscence thou hast. Thou dost not see the devil, but the object that engageth thee thou dost see. Get the mastery then over that of which thou art sensible within. Fight valiantly, for He who hath regenerated thee is thy Judge; He hath arranged the lists, He is making ready the crown. But because thou wilt without doubt be conquered, if thou have not Him to aid thee, if He abandon thee: therefore dost thou say in the prayer, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" The Judge's wrath hath given over some to their own lusts; and the Apostle says, \"God gave them over to the lusts of their hearts.\"[fn-33-P3375_1483043:20-nf] How did He give them up?

But, behold, with an abundance (of evidence)[fn-107-P10756_3018339:310-nf] the Father from heaven replies, for the purpose of testifying to the Son: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-107-P10757_3018510:311-nf] So, again, in that asseveration, \"I have both glorified, and will glorify again,\"[fn-107-P10758_3018614:312-nf] how many Persons do you discover, obstinate Praxeas? Are there not as many as there are voices? You have the Son on earth, you have the Father in heaven. Now this is not a separation; it is nothing but the divine dispensation. We know, however, that God is in the bottomless depths, and exists everywhere; but then it is by power and authority. We are also sure that the Son, being indivisible from Him, is everywhere with Him. Nevertheless, in the Economy or Dispensation itself, the Father willed that the Son should be regarded[fn-107-P10759_3019166:313-nf] as on earth, and Himself in heaven; whither the Son also Him. self looked up, and prayed, and made supplication of the Father; whither also He taught us to raise ourselves, and pray, \"Our Father which art in heaven,\" etc.,[fn-107-P10760_3019414:314-nf] -although, indeed, He is everywhere present. This heaven the Father willed to be His own throne; while He made the Son to be \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-107-P10761_3019593:315-nf] by sending Him down to the earth, but meaning at the same time to \"crown Him with glory and honour,\"[fn-107-P10762_3019714:316-nf] even by taking Him back to heaven. This He now made good to Him when He said: \"I have both glorified Thee, and will glorify Thee again.\" The Son offers His request from earth, the Father gives His promise from heaven. Why, then, do you make liars of both the Father and the Son? If either the Father spake from heaven to the Son when He Himself was the Son on earth, or the Son prayed to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how happens it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the Father, since the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it that the Father made a promise to Himself, by making it to the Son, since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain that they are two separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would be a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and changeful a God as yours! Therefore it was that in the passage before us the Lord declared to the people present: \"Not on my own account has this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,\"[fn-107-P10763_3020795:317-nf] that these likewise may believe both in the Father and in the Son, severally, in their own names and persons and positions. \"Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me; \"[fn-107-P10764_3021052:318-nf] because it is through the Son that men believe in the Father, while the Father also is the authority whence springs belief in the Son. \"And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10765_3021256:319-nf] How so?

But for the matter of that, things have not turned out well either for the devil or the heretic; because, even in the Son's case, the treason which the devil wrought against Him contributed nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the Son of God, who was in the Son of man, that was betrayed, as the Scripture says afterwards: \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\"[fn-107-P10770_3022679:324-nf] Who is here meant by \"God? \"Certainly not the Father, but the Word of the Father, who was in the Son of man-that is in the flesh, in which Jesus had been already glorified by the divine power and word. \"And God,\" says He, \"shall also glorify Him in Himself; \"[fn-107-P10771_3022955:325-nf] that is to say, the Father shall glorify the Son, because He has Him within Himself; and even though prostrated to the earth, and put to death, He would soon glorify Him by His resurrection, and making Him conqueror over death.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_38_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Next, lest they should say, \"whence then are we to obtain our necessary food?\" He saith not unto them, \"Ye have heard that I have told you before, 'Behold the fowls of the air;'\"[fn-33-P3314_1064461:42-nf] (for they were not yet able to realise[fn-33-P3315_1064521:43-nf] this commandment in their actions); but He added what came far short of this, saying, \"For the workman is worthy of his meat;\"[fn-33-P3316_1064670:44-nf] declaring that they must be nourished by their disciples, that neither they might be high minded towards those whom they were teaching, as though giving all and receiving nothing at their hands; nor these again break away, as being despised by their teachers.","title":"Homily XXXII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":6,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"What is the import of the fact that in so many passages God requires all His commandments tobe kept and fulfilled?

Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.\"[fn-59-P5920_2316806:26-nf] And so again,\" If I do this willingly, I have a reward;\"[fn-59-P5921_2316888:27-nf] while in another passage he says, \"Be ye sober and righteous, and sin not;\"[fn-59-P5922_2316984:28-nf] and again, \"As ye have a readiness to will, so also let there be a prompt performance;\"[fn-59-P5923_2317092:29-nf] then he remarks to Timothy about the younger widows, \"When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they choose to marry.\" So in another passage, \"All that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;\"[fn-59-P5924_2317337:30-nf] while to Timothy himself he says, \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee.\"[fn-59-P5925_2317432:31-nf] Then to Philemon he addresses this explanation: \"That thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but of thine own will.\"[fn-59-P5926_2317581:32-nf] Servants also he advises to obey their masters \"with a good will.\"[fn-59-P5927_2317666:33-nf] In strict accordance with this, James says: \"Do not err, my beloved brethren . . . and have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to persons;\"[fn-59-P5928_2317840:34-nf] and,\" Do not speak evil one of another.\"[fn-59-P5929_2317908:35-nf] So also John in his Epistle writes,\" Do not love the world,\"[fn-59-P5930_2317987:36-nf] and other things of the same import. Now wherever it is said, \"Do not do this,\" and \"Do not do that,\" and wherever there is any requirement in the divine admonitions for the work of the will to do anything, or to refrain from doing anything, there is at once a sufficient proof of free will. No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all from a man's own will when he performs any act in accordance with God. Indeed, a work is then to be pronounced a good one when a person does it willingly; then, too, may the reward of a good work be hoped for from Him concerning whom it is written, \"He shall reward every man according to his works.\"[fn-59-P5931_2318743:37-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"They also maintain that God's grace, which is given through the faith of Jesus Christ, and which is neither the law nor nature, avails only for the remission of sins that have been committed, and not for the shunning of future ones, or the subjugation of those which are now assailing us.

It hath no means of conceiving, but by thee. Thou hast consented, hast as it were in thine heart admitted[fn-34-P3442_1505203:41-nf] her embrace. Lust has risen up, deny thyself to her,follow her not. It is a lust unlawful, impure, and shameful, it will alienate thee from God. Give it not then the embrace of thy consent, lest thou have to bewail the birth; for if thou consent, that is, when thou hast embraced her, she conceives, \"and when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.\" Dost thou not yet fear? \"Sinbringeth forth death;\" at least, fear death. If thou fear not sin, yet fear that whereunto it leads. Sin is sweet; but death is bitter. This is the infelicity of men; that for which they sin, they leave here when they die, and the sin themselves they carry with them. Thou dost sin for money, it must be left here: or for a country seat; it must be left here: or for some woman's sake; she must be left here; and whatsoever it be for which thou dost sin, when thou shalt have closed thine eyes in death, thou must leave it here; yet the sin itself which thou committest, thou carriest with thee.","title":"Sermon VIII.

For it is perhaps not beyond our present subject to discuss the question which has been raised in the churches touching soul and body. Some of those before our time who have dealt with the question of \"principles\" think it right to say that souls have a previous existence as a people in a society of their own, and that among them also there are standards of vice and of virtue, and that the soul there, which abides in goodness, remains without experience of conjunction with the body; but if it does depart from its communion with good, it falls down to this lower life, and so comes to be in a body. Others, on the contrary, marking the order of the making of man as stated by Moses, say, that the soul second to the body in order of time, since God first took dust from the earth and formed man, and then animated the being thus formed by His breath[fn-33-P3392_2199914:144-nf] : and by this argument they prove that the flesh is more noble than the soul; that which was previously formed than that which was afterwards infused into it: for they say that the soul was made for the body, that the thing formed might not be without breath and motion; and that everything that is made for something else is surely less precious than that for which it is made, as the Gospel tells us that \"the soul is more than meat and the body than raiment[fn-33-P3393_2200398:145-nf] ,\" because the latter things exist for the sake of the former-for the soul was not made for meat nor our bodies for raiment, but when the former things were already in being the latter were provided for their needs.","title":"On the Making of Man","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":6,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_127_tractate_cxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4.

For who else placed there the fishes that were to be caught, but He, who, we are bound to believe, threw them into the penury that compelled them to go a fishing, for no other reason than that He wished to show them the miracle He had prepared, that so He might both feed the preachers of His gospel, and at the same time enhance that gospel itself, by the great mystery which He was about to impress on their minds by the number of the fishes?

For I have received faith, which worketh by love, but I have not received perseverance therein to the end. Will any one dare to say that this perseverance is not the gift of God, and that so great a possession as this is ours in such wise that if any one have it the apostle could not say to him, `For what hast thou which thou hast not received?'[fn-63-P6385_2445187:35-nf] since he has this in such a manner as that he has not received it?\" To this, indeed, we are not able to deny, that perseverance in good, progressing even to the end, is also a great gift of God; and that it exists not save it comefrom Him of whom it is written, \"Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.\"[fn-63-P6386_2445563:36-nf] But the rebuke of him who has not persevered must not on that account be neglected, \"lest God perchance give unto him repentance, and he recover from the snares of the devil;\"[fn-63-P6387_2445756:37-nf] since to the usefulness of rebuke the apostle has subjoined this decision, saying, as I have above mentioned, \"Rebuking with moderation those that think differently, lest at any time God give them repentance.\"[fn-63-P6388_2445986:38-nf] For if we should say that such a perseverance, so laudable and so blessed, is man's in such wise as that he has it not from God, we first of all make void that which the Lord says to Peter: \"I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.\"[fn-63-P6389_2446246:39-nf] For what did He ask for him, but perseverance to the end? And assuredly, if a man could have this from man, it should not have been asked from God. Then when the apostle says, \"Now we pray to God that ye do no evil,\"[fn-63-P6390_2446483:40-nf] beyond a doubt he prays to God on their behalf for perseverance. For certainly he does not \"do no evil\" who forsakes good, and, not persevering in good, turns to the evil, from which he ought to turn aside.[fn-63-P6391_2446711:41-nf] In that place, moreover, where he says, \"I thank my God in every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making quest with joy for your fellowship[fn-63-P6392_2447232:42-nf] in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-63-P6393_2447438:43-nf] -what else does he promise to them from the mercy of God than perseverance in good to the end? And again where he says, \"Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant ofChrist Jesus, always striving for you in prayer, that you may stand perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God,\"[fn-63-P6394_2447753:44-nf] -what is \"that you may stand\" but \"that you may persevere\"?

And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the apostle, again, when he says, \"Now unto Him that is able to keep you without offence, and to establish you before the presence of His glory, immaculate in joy,\"[fn-63-P6396_2448294:46-nf] does he not most manifestly show that perseverance in good unto the end is God's gift? For what but a good perseverance does He give who preserves without offence that He may place before the presence of His glory immaculate in joy? What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: \"And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\"?[fn-63-P6397_2448741:47-nf] Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance? And when we read, \"He that shall persevere unto the end shall be saved;\"[fn-63-P6398_2448906:48-nf] with what salvation but eternal? And when, in the Lord's Prayer, we say to God the Father, \"Hallowed be Thy name,\"[fn-63-P6399_2449039:49-nf] what do we ask but that His name may be hallowed in us? And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: \"We say, 'Hallowed be Thy name,' not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because He said, 'Be ye holy, since I also am holy;'[fn-64-P6400_2449684:50-nf] we ask and entreat that we who have been hallowed in baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to be.\"[fn-64-P6401_2449838:51-nf] Behold the most glorious martyr is of this opinion, that what in these words Christ's faithful people are daily asking is, that they may persevere in that which they have begun to be.

In fine, he [Adam], not only with nobody to make him afraid, but, moreover, in spite of the authority of God's fear, using free will, did not stand in such a state of happiness, in such a facility[fn-65-P6549_2502969:124-nf] of [not] sinning. But these [the saints], I say, not trader the fear of the world, but in spite of the rage of the world lest they should stand, stood firm in the faith; while he could see the good things present which he was going to forsake, they could not see the good things future which they were going to receive. Whence is this, save by the gift of Him from whom they obtained mercy to be faithful; from whom they received the spirit, not of fear, whereby they would yield to the persecutors, but of power, and of love, and of continence, in which they could overcome allthreatenings, all seductions, all torments? To him, therefore, without any sin, was given the free will with which he was created; and he made it to serve sin. But although the will of these had been the servant of sin, it was delivered by Him who said, \"If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.\"[fn-65-P6550_2504026:125-nf] And by that grace they receive so great a freedom, that although as long as they live here they are fighting against sinful lusts, and some sins creep upon them unawares, on account of which they daily say, \"Forgive us our debts,\"[fn-65-P6551_2504279:126-nf] yet they do not any more obey the sin which is unto death, of which the Apostle John says, \"There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.\"[fn-65-P6552_2504460:127-nf] Concerning which sin (since it is not expressed) many and different notions may be entertained.

This sin they no longer serve who are not in the first condition, as Adam, free; but are freed by the grace of God through the second Adam, and by that deliverance have that free will which enables them to serve God, not that by which they may be made captive by the devil.

I shall therefore, in the manifested mercy of Him whose justice is hidden, set about the discussion, in order to the solution of a question of such importance, in accordance with the strength which He may graciously bestow: for hitherto it has only been proposed, not expounded. Let this, then, be the commencement of its exposition, namely, that we bear in mind that in this corruptible body, which burdens the soul,[fn-39-P3906_2156569:8-nf] we live a miserable life. But we who are now redeemed by the Mediator, and have received the earnest of the Holy Spirit, have a blessed life in prospect, although we possess it not as yet in reality. But a hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.[fn-39-P3907_2156945:9-nf] And it is in the evils that every one suffers, not in the good things that he enjoys, that he has need of patience. The present life, therefore, whereof it is written, \"Is not the life of man a term of trial upon earth?\"[fn-39-P3908_2157189:10-nf] in which we are daily crying to the Lord, \"Deliver us from evil,\"[fn-39-P3909_2157272:11-nf] a man is compelled to endure, even when his sins are forgiven him, although it was the first sin that caused his falling into such misery. For the penalty is more protracted than the fault; test the fault should be accounted small, were the penalty to end with itself. On this account it is also, either for the demonstration of our debt of misery, or for the amendment of our passing life, or for the exercise of the necessary patience, that man is kept through time in the penalty, even when he is no longer held by his sin as liable to everlasting damnation. This is the truly lamentable but unblameable condition of the present evil days we pass in this mortal state, even while in it we look with loving eyes to the days that are good. For it comes from the righteous anger of God, whereof the Scriptures say, \"Man, that is born of woman, is of few days and full of anger:\"[fn-39-P3910_2158170:12-nf] for the anger of God is not like that of man, the disturbance of an excited man, but the calm fixing of righteous punishment. In this anger of His, God restraineth not, as it is written, His tender mercies;[fn-39-P3911_2158394:13-nf] but, besides other consolations to the miserable, which He ceaseth not to bestow on mankind, in the fullness of time, when He knew that such had to be done, He sent His only-begotten Son,[fn-39-P3912_2158602:14-nf] by whom He created all things, that He might become man while remaining God, and so be the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus:[fn-39-P3913_2158762:15-nf] that those who believe in Him, being absolved by the layer of regeneration from the guilt of all their sins,-to wit, both of the original sin they have inherited by generation, and to meet which, in particular, regeneration was instituted, and of all others contracted by evil conduct,-might be delivered from perpetual condemnation, and live in faith and hope and love while sojourning in this world, and be walking onward to His visible presence amid its toilsome and perilous temptations on the one hand, but the consolations of God, bothbodily and spiritual, on the other, ever keeping to the way which Christ has become to them. And because, even while walking in Him, they are not exempt from sins, which creep in through the infirmities of this life, He has given them the salutary remedies of alms whereby their prayers might be aided when He taught them to say, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.\"[fn-39-P3914_2159709:16-nf] So does the Church act in blessed hope through this troublous life; and this Church symbolized in its generality, was personified in the Apostle Peter, on account of the primacy of his apostleship. For, as regards his proper personality, he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, by still more abounding grace one, and yet also, the first apostle; but when it was said to him, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,\" he represented the universal Church, which in this world is shaken by divers temptations, that come upon it like torrents of rain, floods and tempests, and falleth not, because it is founded upon a rock (petra), from which Peter received his name. For petra (rock) is not derived from Peter, but Peter from petra; just as Christ is not called so from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. For on this very account the Lord said, \"On this rock will I build my Church,\" because Peter had said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"[fn-39-P3915_2160858:17-nf] On this rock, therefore, He said, which thou hast confessed. I will build my Church. For the Rock (Petra) was Christ;[fn-39-P3916_2160999:18-nf] and on this foundation was Peter himself also built. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus.[fn-39-P3917_2161148:19-nf] The Church, therefore, which is rounded in Christ received from Him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the person of Peter, that is to say, the power of binding and loosing sins. For what the Church is essentially in Christ, such representatively is Peter in the rock (petra); and in this representation Christ is to be understood as the Rock, Peter as the Church. This Church, accordingly, which Peter represented, so long as it lives amidst evil, by loving and following Christ is delivered from evil. But its following is the closer in those who contend even unto death for the truth. But to the universality[fn-39-P3918_2161783:20-nf] [of the Church] is it said, \"Follow me,\" even as it was for the same universality that Christ suffered: of whom this same Peter saith, \"Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His footsteps.\"[fn-39-P3919_2162023:21-nf] This, then, you see is why it was said to him, \"Follow me.\" But there is another, an immortal life, that is not in the midst of evil: there we shall see face to face what is seen here through a glass and in a riddle,[fn-39-P3920_2162260:22-nf] even when much progress is made in the beholding of the truth. There are two states of life, therefore, preached and commended to herself from heaven, that are known to the Church, whereof the one is in faith, the other in sight; one in the temporal sojourn in a foreign land, the other in the eternity of the [heavenly] abode; one in labor, the other in repose; one on the way, the other in the fatherland; one in active work, the other in the wages of contemplation; one declines from evil and makes for good, the other has no evil to decline from, and has great good to enjoy; the one fights with a foe, the other reigns without a foe; the one is brave in the midst of adversities, the other has no experience of adversity; the one is bridling its carnal lusts, the other has full scope for spiritual delights; the one is anxious with the care of conquering, the other secure in the peace of victory; the one is helped in temptations, the other, free from all temptations, rejoices in the Helper Himself; the one is occupied in relieving the indigent, the other is there, where no indigence is found; the one pardons the sins of others, that its own may be pardoned to itself, the other neither has anything to pardon nor does aught for which pardon has to be asked; the one is scourged with evils that it may not be elated with good things, the other is free from all evil by such a fullness of grace that, without any temptation to pride, it may cleave to that which is supremely good; the one discerneth both good and evil, the other has only that which is good presented to view: therefore the one is good, but miserable as yet; the other, better and blessed. This one was signified by the Apostle Peter, that other by John. The whole of the one is passed here to the end of this world, and there finds its termination, the other is deferred for its completion till after the end of this world, but has no end in the world to come. Hence it is said to the latter, \"Follow me;\" but of the former, \"Thus I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee follow thou me.\" For what means this last? So far as my wisdom goes, so far as I comprehend, what is it but this, Follow thou me by imitating me in the endurance of temporal evils; let him remain till I come to restore everlasting good? And this may be expressed more clearly in this way: Let perfected action, informed by the example of my passion, follow me; but let contemplation only begun remain [so] till I come, to be perfected when I come. For the godly plenitude of patience, reaching forward even unto death, followeth Christ; but the fullness of knowledge tarrieth till Christ come, to be manifested then. For here the evils of this world are endured in the land of the dying, while there shall be seen the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. For in saying, \"I wish him to tarry till I come,\" we are not to understand Him as meaning to remain on, or abide permanently, but to wait; seeing that what is signified by him shall certainly not be fulfilled now, but when Christ is come. But what is signified by him to whom it was said, \"Follow thou me,\" unless it be done now, will never attain to the expected end. And in this life of activity. the more we love Christ the more easily are we delivered from evil. But He loveth us less as we now are, and therefore delivers from it, that we may not be always such as we are. There, however, He loveth us more; for we shall not have aught about us to displease Him, or aught that He will have to separate us from: nor is it for aught else that He loveth us here but that He may heal and translate us from everything He loveth not. Here, therefore, the loveth us] less, where He would not have us remain; there in larger measure, whither He would have us to be passing, and out of that wherein He would not that we should perish. Let Peter therefore love Him, that we may obtain deliverance from our present mortality; let John be loved by Him, that we may be preserved in the immortality to come.","title":"Tractate CXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_129_tractate_cxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5.

In this anger of His, God restraineth not, as it is written, His tender mercies;[fn-39-P3911_2158394:13-nf] but, besides other consolations to the miserable, which He ceaseth not to bestow on mankind, in the fullness of time, when He knew that such had to be done, He sent His only-begotten Son,[fn-39-P3912_2158602:14-nf] by whom He created all things, that He might become man while remaining God, and so be the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus:[fn-39-P3913_2158762:15-nf] that those who believe in Him, being absolved by the layer of regeneration from the guilt of all their sins,-to wit, both of the original sin they have inherited by generation, and to meet which, in particular, regeneration was instituted, and of all others contracted by evil conduct,-might be delivered from perpetual condemnation, and live in faith and hope and love while sojourning in this world, and be walking onward to His visible presence amid its toilsome and perilous temptations on the one hand, but the consolations of God, bothbodily and spiritual, on the other, ever keeping to the way which Christ has become to them. And because, even while walking in Him, they are not exempt from sins, which creep in through the infirmities of this life, He has given them the salutary remedies of alms whereby their prayers might be aided when He taught them to say, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.\"[fn-39-P3914_2159709:16-nf] So does the Church act in blessed hope through this troublous life; and this Church symbolized in its generality, was personified in the Apostle Peter, on account of the primacy of his apostleship. For, as regards his proper personality, he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, by still more abounding grace one, and yet also, the first apostle; but when it was said to him, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,\" he represented the universal Church, which in this world is shaken by divers temptations, that come upon it like torrents of rain, floods and tempests, and falleth not, because it is founded upon a rock (petra), from which Peter received his name. For petra (rock) is not derived from Peter, but Peter from petra; just as Christ is not called so from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. For on this very account the Lord said, \"On this rock will I build my Church,\" because Peter had said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"[fn-39-P3915_2160858:17-nf] On this rock, therefore, He said, which thou hast confessed. I will build my Church. For the Rock (Petra) was Christ;[fn-39-P3916_2160999:18-nf] and on this foundation was Peter himself also built. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus.[fn-39-P3917_2161148:19-nf] The Church, therefore, which is rounded in Christ received from Him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the person of Peter, that is to say, the power of binding and loosing sins. For what the Church is essentially in Christ, such representatively is Peter in the rock (petra); and in this representation Christ is to be understood as the Rock, Peter as the Church. This Church, accordingly, which Peter represented, so long as it lives amidst evil, by loving and following Christ is delivered from evil. But its following is the closer in those who contend even unto death for the truth. But to the universality[fn-39-P3918_2161783:20-nf] [of the Church] is it said, \"Follow me,\" even as it was for the same universality that Christ suffered: of whom this same Peter saith, \"Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His footsteps.\"[fn-39-P3919_2162023:21-nf] This, then, you see is why it was said to him, \"Follow me.\" But there is another, an immortal life, that is not in the midst of evil: there we shall see face to face what is seen here through a glass and in a riddle,[fn-39-P3920_2162260:22-nf] even when much progress is made in the beholding of the truth. There are two states of life, therefore, preached and commended to herself from heaven, that are known to the Church, whereof the one is in faith, the other in sight; one in the temporal sojourn in a foreign land, the other in the eternity of the [heavenly] abode; one in labor, the other in repose; one on the way, the other in the fatherland; one in active work, the other in the wages of contemplation; one declines from evil and makes for good, the other has no evil to decline from, and has great good to enjoy; the one fights with a foe, the other reigns without a foe; the one is brave in the midst of adversities, the other has no experience of adversity; the one is bridling its carnal lusts, the other has full scope for spiritual delights; the one is anxious with the care of conquering, the other secure in the peace of victory; the one is helped in temptations, the other, free from all temptations, rejoices in the Helper Himself; the one is occupied in relieving the indigent, the other is there, where no indigence is found; the one pardons the sins of others, that its own may be pardoned to itself, the other neither has anything to pardon nor does aught for which pardon has to be asked; the one is scourged with evils that it may not be elated with good things, the other is free from all evil by such a fullness of grace that, without any temptation to pride, it may cleave to that which is supremely good; the one discerneth both good and evil, the other has only that which is good presented to view: therefore the one is good, but miserable as yet; the other, better and blessed. This one was signified by the Apostle Peter, that other by John. The whole of the one is passed here to the end of this world, and there finds its termination, the other is deferred for its completion till after the end of this world, but has no end in the world to come. Hence it is said to the latter, \"Follow me;\" but of the former, \"Thus I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee follow thou me.\" For what means this last? So far as my wisdom goes, so far as I comprehend, what is it but this, Follow thou me by imitating me in the endurance of temporal evils; let him remain till I come to restore everlasting good? And this may be expressed more clearly in this way: Let perfected action, informed by the example of my passion, follow me; but let contemplation only begun remain [so] till I come, to be perfected when I come. For the godly plenitude of patience, reaching forward even unto death, followeth Christ; but the fullness of knowledge tarrieth till Christ come, to be manifested then. For here the evils of this world are endured in the land of the dying, while there shall be seen the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. For in saying, \"I wish him to tarry till I come,\" we are not to understand Him as meaning to remain on, or abide permanently, but to wait; seeing that what is signified by him shall certainly not be fulfilled now, but when Christ is come. But what is signified by him to whom it was said, \"Follow thou me,\" unless it be done now, will never attain to the expected end. And in this life of activity. the more we love Christ the more easily are we delivered from evil. But He loveth us less as we now are, and therefore delivers from it, that we may not be always such as we are. There, however, He loveth us more; for we shall not have aught about us to displease Him, or aught that He will have to separate us from: nor is it for aught else that He loveth us here but that He may heal and translate us from everything He loveth not. Here, therefore, the loveth us] less, where He would not have us remain; there in larger measure, whither He would have us to be passing, and out of that wherein He would not that we should perish. Let Peter therefore love Him, that we may obtain deliverance from our present mortality; let John be loved by Him, that we may be preserved in the immortality to come.","title":"Tractate CXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-04","text":"1. Having now briefly arranged these points in order as we best could, it follows that, agreeably to our intention from the first, we refute those who think that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is a different God from Him who gave the answers of the law to Moses, or commissioned the prophets, who is the God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For in this article of faith, first of all, we must be firmly grounded. We have to consider, then, the expression of frequent recurrence in the Gospels, and subjoined to all the acts of our Lord and Saviour, \"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by this or that prophet,\" it being manifest that the prophets are the prophets of that God who made the world. From this therefore we draw the conclusion, that He who sent the prophets, Himself predicted what was to be foretold of Christ. And there is no doubt that the Father Himself, and not another different from Him, uttered these predictions. The practice, moreover, of the Saviour or His apostles, frequently quoting illustrations from the Old Testament, shows that they attribute authority to the ancients. The injunction also of the Saviour, when exhorting His disciples to the exercise of kindness, \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect; for He commands His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust,\"[fn-65-P6524_1282839:34-nf] most evidently suggests even to a person of feeble understanding, that He is proposing to the imitation of His disciples no other God than the maker of heaven and the bestower of the rain. Again, what else does the expression, which ought to be used by those who pray, \"Our Father who art in heaven,\"[fn-65-P6525_1283162:35-nf] appear to indicate, save that God is to be sought in the better parts of the world, i.e., of His creation? Further, do not those admirable principles which He lays down respecting oaths, saying that we ought not to \"swear either by heaven, because it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, because it is His footstool,\"[fn-65-P6526_1283502:36-nf] harmonize most clearly with the words of the prophet, \"Heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool? \"[fn-65-P6527_1283633:37-nf] And also when casting out of the temple those who sold sheep, and oxen, and doves, and pouring out the tables of the money-changers, and saying, \"Take these things, hence, and do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise,\"[fn-65-P6528_1283883:38-nf] He undoubtedly called Him His Father, to whose name Solomon had raised a magnificent temple. The words, moreover, \"Have you not read what was spoken by God to Moses: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He is not a God of the dead, but of the living,\"[fn-65-P6529_1284185:39-nf] most clearly teach us, that He called the God of the patriarchs (because they were holy, and were alive) the God of the living, the same, viz., who had said in the prophets, \"I am God, and besides Me there is no God.\"[fn-65-P6530_1284444:40-nf] For if the Saviour, knowing that He who is written in the law is the God of Abraham, and that it is the same who says, \"I am God, and besides Me there is no God, acknowledges that very one to be His Father who is ignorant of the existence of any other God above Himself, as the heretics suppose, He absurdly declares Him to be His Father who does not know of a greater God. But if it is not from ignorance, but from deceit, that He says there is no other God than Himself, then it is a much greater absurdity to confess that His Father is guilty of falsehood. From all which this conclusion is arrived at, that He knows of no other Father than God, the Founder and Creator of all things.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":6,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The fourth petition is, \"Give us this day our daily bread,\"[fn-69-P6970_2664930:11-nf] where the blessed Cyprian shows how here also\nperseverance is understood to be asked for.

For the sins which we ask to be forgiven us are past, but\nperseverance, which saves us for eternity, is indeed necessary for the time of this life; but not for\nthe time which is past, but for that which remains even to its end. Yet it is worth the labour to\nconsider for a little, how even already in this petition the heretics who were to arise long after\nwere transfixed by the tongue of Cyprian, as if by the most invincible dart of truth. For the\nPelagians dare to say even this: that the righteous man in this life has no sin at all, and that in\nsuch men there is even at the present time a Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such\nthing,[fn-69-P6976_2666712:14-nf] which is the one and only bride of\nChrist; as if she were not His bride who throughout the whole earth says what she has learnt from\nHim, \"Forgive us our debts.\" But observe how the most glorious Cyprian destroys these. For when he\nwas expounding that very clause of the Lord's Prayer, he says among other things: \"And how\nnecessarily, how providently, and salutarily are we admonished that we are sinners, since we are\ncompelled to entreat for our sins; and while pardon is asked for from God, the soul recalls its own\nconsciousness. Lest any one should flatter himself that he is innocent, and by exalting himself\nshould more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden daily\nto entreat for his sins. Thus, moreover, John also in his Epistle warns[fn-69-P6977_2667519:15-nf] us, and says,[fn-69-P6978_2667583:16-nf] 'If we say that we have no sin, we deceive\nourselves, and the truth is not in us.'\"[fn-69-P6979_2667685:17-nf]\nAnd the rest, which it would be long to insert in this place.","title":"A Treatise on the Gift of\nPerseverance, Being the Second Book","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now, moreover, when the saints say, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from\nevil,\"[fn-69-P6983_2667940:18-nf] what do they pray for but that they\nmay persevere in holiness? For, assuredly, when that gift of God is granted to them,-which is\nsufficiently plainly shown to be God's gift, since it is asked of Him,-that gift of God, then, being\ngranted to them that they may not be led into temptation, none of the saints fails to keep his\nperseverance in holiness even to the end. For there is not any one who ceases to persevere in the\nChristian purpose unless he is first of all led into temptation.

But it is for that reason we ask not to be led into temptation, so that\nthis may not happen. And if we are heard, certainly it does not happen, because God does not allow it\nto happen. For nothing comes to pass except what either He Himself does, or Himself allows to be\ndone. Therefore He is powerful both to turn wills from evil to good, and to convert those that are\ninclined to fall, or to direct them into a way pleasing to Himself. For to Him it is not said in\nvain, \"O God, Thou shalt turn again and quicken us;\"[fn-69-P6994_2672173:20-nf] it is not vainly said, \"Give not my foot to be\nmoved;\"[fn-69-P6995_2672248:21-nf] it is not vainly said, \"Give me\nnot over, O Lord, from my desire to the sinner;\"[fn-69-P6996_2672347:22-nf] finally, not to mention many passages, since\nprobably more may occur to you, it is not vainly said, \"Lead us not into temptation.\"[fn-69-P6997_2672495:23-nf] For whoever is not led into temptation, certainly\nis not led into the temptation of his own evil will; and he who is not led into the temptation of his\nown evil will, is absolutely led into no temptation. For \"every one is tempted,\" as it is written,\n\"when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed;\"[fn-69-P6998_2672819:24-nf] \"but God tempteth no man,\"[fn-69-P6999_2672863:25-nf] -that is to say, with a hurtful temptation. For\ntemptation is moreover beneficial by which we are not deceived or overwhelmed, but proved, according\nto that which is said, \"Prove me, O Lord, and try me.\"[fn-70-P7000_2673084:26-nf] Therefore, with that hurtful temptation which the\napostle signifies when he says, \"Lost by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be\nin vain,\"[fn-70-P7001_2673262:27-nf] \"God tempteth no man,\" as I have\nsaid,-that is, He brings or leads no one into temptation. For to be tempted and not to be led into\ntemptation is not evil,-nay, it is even good; for this it is to be proved. When, therefore, we say to\nGod, \"Lead us not into temptation,\" what do we say but, \"Permit us not to be led\"? Whence some pray\nin this manner, and it is read in many codices, and the most blessed Cyprian thus uses it: \"Do not\nsuffer us to be led into temptation.\" In the Greek gospel, however, I have never found it otherwise\nthan, \"Load us not into temptation.\" We live, therefore, more securely if we give up the whole to\nGod, and do not entrust ourselves partly to Him and partly to ourselves, as that venerable martyr\nsaw. For when he would expound the same clause of the prayer, he says among other things, \"But when\nwe ask that we may not come into temptation, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness while we\nthus ask, lest any should insolently vaunt himself,-lest any should proudly and arrogantly assume\nanything to himself,-lest any should take to himself the glory either of confession or suffering as\nhis own; since the Lord Himself, teaching humility, said, 'Watch and pray, that ye enter not into\ntemptation; the Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.' So that when a humble and\nsubmissive confession comes first and all is attributed to God, whatever is sought for suppliantly,\nwith the fear of God, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.\"[fn-70-P7002_2674767:28-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Gift of\nPerseverance, Being the Second Book","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":48,"source_paragraph":"168","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But it is said, \"It is by his own fault that any one deserts the faith, when he yields and\nconsents to the temptation which is the cause of his desertion of the faith.\" Who denies it?

Is it not evident to all that they are stones, as is the veritable Hermes himself? As the Halo is not a god, and as the Iris is not a god, but are states of the atmosphere and of the clouds; and as, likewise, a day is not a god, nor a year, nor time, which is made up of these, so neither is sun nor moon, by which each of those mentioned above is determined. Who, then, in his right senses, can imagine Correction, and Punishment, and Justice, and Retribution to be gods? For neither the Furies, nor the Fates, nor Destiny are gods, since neither Government, nor Glory, nor Wealth are gods, which last [as Plutus] painters represent as blind. But if you deify Modesty, and Love, and Venus, let these be followed by Infamy, and Passion, and Beauty, and Intercourse. Therefore Sleep and Death cannot reasonably any more be regarded as twin deities, being merely changes which take place naturally in living creatures; no more will you with propriety call Fortune, or Destiny, or the Fates goddesses. And if Strife and Battle be not gods, no more are Arês and Enyo. Still further, if the lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can fire and water be gods? how can shooting stars and comets, which are produced by atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him also so call Action. If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed by human hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a God, while a providence exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine power,[fn-32-P3204_942177:136-nf] it remains only to acknowledge this, that He alone who is truly God, only truly is and subsists. But those who are insensible to this are like men who have drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God grant that you may at length awake from this slumber, and know God; and that neither Gold, nor Stone, nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor Disease, nor Fear, may appear in your eyes as a god. For there are, in sooth, \"on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand\" demons, not immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life through the force of custom. \"The earth is the Lord's,\" it is said, \"and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-32-P3205_943378:137-nf] Then why darest thou, while luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler? \"Leave my earth,\" the Lord will say to thee. \"Touch not the water which I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my husbandry\" Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge thy Master. Thou art God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of truth. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more mystically, like the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot's wife, are ye not turned into a state of insensibility? This woman we have heard, was turned into stone for her love of Sodore. And those who are godless, addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish are Sodomites. Believe that these utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred,[fn-32-P3206_944473:138-nf] and take beasts and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of human kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and honour the raven as a messenger of God. But the man of God, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither welcoming the grace which, comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose love to man is ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His anger augments punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind, deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe, and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the knowledge of God; nor does any one who has conquered[fn-32-P3207_946125:139-nf] by brass or iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and God, where is neither moth,[fn-32-P3208_946659:140-nf] robber, nor pirate, but the eternal Giver of good. With justice, then, have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For \"their mind,\" says the Scripture, \"is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers.\"[fn-32-P3209_946988:141-nf] But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of sanctity, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of destruction, as they[fn-32-P3210_947371:142-nf] have been divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions.[fn-32-P3211_947654:143-nf] \"For the enemies of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"shall lick the dust.\"[fn-32-P3212_947866:144-nf] Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart to contain God. \"Trust in Him, all ye assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him.\"[fn-32-P3213_948438:145-nf] He says to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, \"He pities them, and fills them with righteousness.\" Believe Him who is man and God; believe, O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is adored. Believe, ye slaves,[fn-32-P3214_948694:146-nf] Him who died; believe, all ye of human kind, Him who alone is God of all men. Believe, and receive salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation. Hast thou found God?-then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with God. \"Let all who seek Thee be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God be magnified.\"[fn-32-P3215_949221:147-nf] A noble hymn of God is an immortal man, established in righteousness, in whom the oracles of truth are engraved. For where but in a soul that is wise can you write truth? where love? where reverence? where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of salvation: wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the Father, have proved good fathers to their children; and good parents to their sons, those who have known the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants,[fn-32-P3216_949950:148-nf] those who have been redeemed from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in error! who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth. There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no superstition: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to know God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the knowledge of God, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of salvation. You have become old in superstition; as young, enter on the practice of piety. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the laws of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if thou enrol thyself as one of God's people, heaven is thy country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the laws? \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not seduce boys; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt love the Lord thy God.\"[fn-32-P3217_951387:149-nf] And the complements of these are those laws. of reason and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men's hearts: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes thee on the cheek, present also the other; \"[fn-32-P3218_951643:150-nf] \"thou shalt not lust, for by lust alone thou hast committed adultery.\"[fn-32-P3219_951734:151-nf] How much better, therefore, is it for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of salvation; but as we delight in sweet' things, and prize them higher for the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand, those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak stomach, thus custom pleases and, tickles; but custom pushes into the abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our constitution-in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this of truth, which is embraced by these three things in all-will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath filled the universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily to men, having dawned from His Father's counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us. Whence He was and what He was, He showed by what He taught and exhibited, manifesting Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the Reconciler, our Saviour, the Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of peace, diffused over the whole face of the earth; by whom, so to speak, the universe has already become an ocean of blessings.[fn-32-P3220_954384:152-nf] ","title":"Exhortation to the Heathen","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_41_the_treatise_concerning_widows_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"5.

And he who fulfils this commandment is in reality a child and a son to God and to the world,-to the one as deceived, to the other as beloved. And if we have one Master in heaven, as the Scripture says, then by common consent those on the earth will be rightly called disciples. For so is the truth, that perfection is with the Lord, who is always teaching, and infancy and childishness with us, who are always learning. Thus prophecy hath honoured perfection, by applying to it the appellation man. For instance, by David, He says of the devil: \"The Lord abhors the man of blood; \"[fn-33-P3361_1001079:37-nf] he calls him man, as perfect in wickedness. And the Lord is called man, because He is perfect in righteousness. Directly in point is the instance of the apostle, who says, writing the Corinthians: \"For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-33-P3362_1001382:38-nf] whether as children or saints, but to the Lord alone. And writing to the Ephesians, he has unfolded in the clearest manner the point in question, speaking to the following effect: \"Till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we be no longer children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, by the craft of men, by their cunning in stratagems of deceit; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up to Him in all things,\"[fn-33-P3363_1001938:39-nf] -saying these things in order to the edification of the body of Christ, who is the head and man, the only one perfect in righteousness; and we who are children guarding against the blasts of heresies, which blow to our inflation; and not putting our trust in fathers who teach us otherwise, are then made perfect when we are the church, having received Christ the head. Then it is right to notice, with respect to the appellation of infant (nh/pioj), that to\\ nh/pion is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called nhpu/tioj: and nh/pioj is neh/pioj (since he that is tender-hearted is calledh !pioj), as being one that has newly become gentle and meek in Conduct. This the blessed Paul most clearly pointed out when he said, \"When we might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, we were gentle (h !pioi) among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-33-P3364_1002835:40-nf] The child (nh/pioj) is therefore gentle (h !pioj), and therefore more tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy, straightforward and upright in mind, which is the basis of simplicity and truth. For He says, \"Upon whom shall I look, but upon him who is gentle and quiet? \"[fn-33-P3365_1003156:41-nf] For such is the virgin speech, tender, and free of fraud; whence also a virgin is wont to be called \"a tender bride,\" and a child \"tender-hearted.\" And we are tender who are pliant to the power of persuasion, and are easily drawn to goodness, and are mild, and free of the stain of malice and perverseness, for the ancient race was perverse and hard-hearted; but the band of infants, the new people which we are, i.s delicate as a child.

For if they call us who follow after childhood foolish, see how they utter blasphemy against the Lord, in regarding those as foolish who have betaken themselves to God. But if, which is rather the true sense, they themselves understand the designation children of simple ones, we glory in the name.

But it is not inconsistent with the saving Word, to administer rebuke dictated by solicitude. For this is the medicine of the divine love to man, by which the blush of modesty breaks forth, and shame at sin supervenes.

There and thenceforth you were severed from the world; how much more from the ordinary course of worldly life and all its affairs! Nor let this separation from the world alarm you; for if we reflect that the world is more really the prison, we shall see that you have gone out of a prison rather than into one. The world has the greater darkness, blinding men's hearts. The world imposes the more grievous fetters, binding men's very souls. The world breathes out the worst impurities-human lusts. The world contains the larger number of criminals, even the whole human race. Then, last of all, it awaits the judgment, not of the proconsul, but of God. Wherefore, O blessed, you may regard yourselves as having been translated from a prison to, we may say, a place of safety. It is full of darkness, but ye yourselves are light; it has bonds, but God has made you free. Unpleasant exhalations are there, but ye are an odour of sweetness. The judge is daily looked for, but ye shall judge the judges themselves. Sadness may be there for him who sighs for the world's enjoyments. The Christian outside the prison has renounced the world, but in the prison he has renounced a prison too. It is of no consequence where you are in the world-you who are not of it. And if you have lost some of life's sweets, it is the way of business to suffer present loss, that after gains may be the larger. Thus far I say nothing of the rewards to which God invites the martyrs. Meanwhile let us compare the life of the world and of the prison, and see if the spirit does not gain more in the prison than the flesh loses. Nay, by the care of the Church and the love of the brethren,[fn-120-P12068_3361784:4-nf] even the flesh does not lose there what is for its good, while the spirit obtains besides important advantages. You have no occasion to look on strange gods, you do not run against their images; you have no part in heathen holidays, even by mere bodily mingling in them; you are not annoyed by the foul fumes of idolatrous solemnities; you are not pained by the noise of the public shows, nor by the atrocity or madness or immodesty of their celebrants; your eyes do not fall on stews and brothels; you are free from causes of offence, from temptations, from unholy reminiscences; you are free now from persecution too. The prison does the same service for the Christian which the desert did for the prophet. Our Lord Himself spent much of His time in seclusion, that He might have greater liberty to pray, that He might be quit of the world. It was in a mountain solitude, too, He showed His glory to the disciples. Let us drop the name of prison; let us call it a place of retirement. Though the body is shut in, though the flesh is confined, all things are open to the spirit. In spirit, then, roam abroad; in spirit walk about, not setting before you shady paths or long colonnades, but the way which leads to God. As often as in spirit your footsteps are there, so often you will not be in bonds. The leg does not feel the chain when the mind is in the heavens. The mind compasses the whole man about, and whither it wills it carries him. But where thy heart shall be, there shall be thy treasure.[fn-120-P12069_3363435:5-nf] Be there our heart, then, where we would have our treasure.","title":"Ad Martyras.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_53_book_ii_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"162","folder":"ANF-02","text":"What, I ask, more graceful, more gay-coloured, than flowers?

For this is the true luxury-the treasured wealth. But that which is squandered on foolish lusts is to be reckoned waste, not expenditure. For God has given to us, I know well, the liberty of use, but only so far as necessary; and He has determined that the use should be common. And it is monstrous for one to live in luxury, while many are in want. How much more glorious is it to do good to many, than to live sumptuously!

Men, I would say, if they make use of them impartially and indifferently.

The third kind is what aims after one thing-merely to conquer and overturn; but to turn conquest either to a good or a bad purpose, belongs not to such rule. Such was the aim of the Persians in their campaign against Greece. For, on the one hand, fondness for strife is solely the result of passion, and acquires power solely for the sake of domination; while, on the other, the love of good is characteristic of a soul which uses its high spirit for noble ends. The fourth, the worst of all, is the sovereignty which acts according to the promptings of the passions, as that of Sardanapalus, and those who propose to themselves as their end the gratification of the passions to the utmost. But the instrument of regal sway-the instrument at once of that which overcomes by virtue, and that which does so by force-is the power of managing (or tact). And it, varies according to the nature and the material. In the case of arms and of fighting animals the ordering power is the soul and mind, by means animate and inanimate; and in the case of the passions of the soul, which we master by virtue, reason is the ordering power, by affixing the seal of continence and self-restraint, along with holiness, and sound knowledge with truth, making the result of the whole to terminate in piety towards God. For it is wisdom which regulates in the case of those who so practise virtue; and divine things are ordered by wisdom, and human affairs by politics-all things by the kingly faculty.

Why then in another place doth He say, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-39-P3986_1719907:94-nf] And a little after, \"For what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\"[fn-39-P3987_1720014:95-nf] But when in another place He says, \"If I had not done amongst them the works which none other man did,\"[fn-39-P3988_1720135:96-nf] He speaks as if He did them alone. Now if these things are so expressed, as that nevertheless the works of the Father and the Son are inseparable, what must we believe of the Holy Spirit, but that He also worketh equally with them? For in that very place, from which this question arose which we are discussing, when the Son was casting out devils, He yet said, \"If I in the Holy Spirit cast out devils, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.\"[fn-39-P3989_1720600:97-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXI.

And thus sins, because they are not forgiven out of the Church, must be forgiven by that Spirit, by whom the Church is gathered together into one. In fact, if any one out of the Church repent him of his sins, and for this so great sin whereby he is an alien from the Church of God, has an heart impenitent, what doth that other repentance profit him? seeing by this alone he speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost, whereby he is alienated from the Church, which hath received this gift, that in her remission of sins should be given in the Holy Ghost? Which remission though it be the work of the Whole Trinity, is yet understood specially to belong to the Holy Spirit. For He is the Spirit of the adoption of sons, \"in whom we cry Abba, Father;\"[fn-40-P4006_1727131:111-nf] that we may be able to say to Him, \"Forgive us our debts.\"[fn-40-P4007_1727212:112-nf] And, \"Hereby we know\" as the Apostle John says, \"that Christ dwelleth in us, by His Spirit which He hath given us.\"[fn-40-P4008_1727349:113-nf] \"The Spirit Itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.\"[fn-40-P4009_1727457:114-nf] For to Him appertains the fellowship, by which we are made the one body of the One only Son of God.

Because as by tongues the fellowship of mankind is more closely united; so it behoved that this fellowship of the sons of God and members of Christ which was to be among all nations should be signified by the tongues of all nations; that as at that time he was known to have received the Holy Ghost, who spake with the tongues of all nations; so now he should acknowledge that he has received the Holy Ghost, who is held by the bond of the peace of the Church, which is spread throughout all nations.

For, brethren, ye heard just now when the Gospel was read, at least if ye had for it the ear not only of the body but also of the heart. What said it? \"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them.\"[fn-44-P4492_2423278:3-nf] Did He mean to say this, that whatever good things we do, we should hide them from the eyes of men,[fn-44-P4493_2423394:4-nf] and fear to be seen? If thou fearest spectators thou wilt not have imitators: thou oughtest therefore to be seen. But thou must not do it to the end thou mayest be seen. Not there should be the end of thy joy, not there the goal of thy rejoicing, that thou shouldest account thyself to have gotten the whole fruit of thy good work, when thou art seen and praised. This is nothing. Despise thyself when thou art praised, let Him be praised in thee who worketh by thee. Therefore do not for thine own praise work the good thou doest: but to the praise of Him from whom thou hast the power to do good. From thyself thou hast the ill doing, from God thou hast the well doing. On the other hand, see perverse men, how preposterous they are. What they do well, they will needs ascribe to themselves; if they do ill, they will needs accuse God. Reverse this distorted and preposterous proceeding, which puts the thing, as one may say, head downwards, which makes that undermost which is uppermost,[fn-44-P4494_2424491:5-nf] and that upwards which is downwards. Dost thou want to make God undermost and thyself uppermost? Thou goest headlong, not elevatest thyself; for He is always above. What then? thou well, and God ill? nay rather, say this, if thou wouldest speak more truly, I ill, He well; and what I do well from Him is the well-doing: for from myself whatever I do is ill. This confession strengthens the heart, and makes a firm foundation of love. For if we ought to hide our good works lest they be seen of men, what becomes of that sentence of the Lord in the sermon which He delivered on the mount? Where He said this, there He also said a little before, \"Let your good works shine before men.\"[fn-44-P4495_2425447:6-nf] And He did not stop there, did not there make an end, but added, \"And glorify your Father which is in Heaven.\" And what saith the apostle? \"And I was unknown by face unto the Churches of Judea which were in Christ: but they heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. And in me they glorified God.\"[fn-44-P4496_2425822:7-nf] See how he also, in regard that he became so widely known did not set the good in his own praise, but in the praise of God. And as for him, in his own person, that he was one who laid waste the Church, a persecutor, envious, malignant, it is himself that confesses this, not we that reproach him therewith. Paul loves to have his sins spoken of by us, that He may be glorified who healed such a disease. For it was the hand of the Physician that cut end healed the greatness of the sore. That voice from heaven prostrated the persecutor, and raised up the preacher; killed Saul, and quickened Paul.[fn-44-P4497_2426439:8-nf] For Saul was the persecutor of a holy man; thence had this man his name, when he persecuted the Christians:[fn-44-P4498_2426568:9-nf] afterward of Saul he became Paul. What does the name Paulus mean? Little. Therefore when he was Saul, he was proud, lifted up; when he was Paul, he was lowly, little, Thus we say, I will see thee \"paulo post,\" i.e. after a little while.[fn-44-P4499_2426821:10-nf] Hear that he was made little: \"For I am the least of the apostles;[fn-45-P4500_2427767:11-nf] and, To me the least of all saints,\" he saith in another place.

Accordingly we agree with Cyprian that \"heretics cannot give remission of sins;\"[fn-37-P3773_2089585:72-nf] but we maintain that they can give baptism,-which indeed in them, both when they give and when they receive it, is profitable only to their destruction, as misusing so great a gift of God; just as also the malicious and envious, whom Cyprian himself acknowledges to be within the Church, cannot give remission of sins, while we all confess that they can give baptism. For if it was said of those who have sinned against us, \"If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,\"[fn-37-P3774_2090124:73-nf] how much more impossible is it that their sins should be forgiven who hate the brethren by whom they are loved, and are baptized in that very hatred; and yet when they are brought to the right way, baptism is not given them anew, but that very pardon which they did not then deserve is granted them in their true conversion? And so even what Cyprian wrote to Quintus, and what, in conjunction with his colleagues Liberalis, Caldonius, Junius, and the rest, he wrote to Saturninus, Maximus, and others, is all found, on due consideration, to be in no wise meet to be preferred as against the agreement of the whole Catholic Church, of which they rejoiced that they were members, and from which they neither cut themselves away nor allowed others to be cut away who held a contrary opinion, until at length, by the will of the Lord, it was made manifest, by a plenary Council many years afterwards, what was the more perfect way, and that not by the institution of any novelty, but by confirming what was old.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_140_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. \"Herein is our love made perfect in us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as He is, so are we in this world.\"[fn-45-P4562_2460967:4-nf] He tells how each may prove himself, what progress charity has made in him or rather what progress he has made in charity. For if charity is God, God is capable neither of proficiency nor of deficiency: that charity is said to be making proficiency in thee, means only that thou makest proficiency in it. Ask therefore what proficiency thou hast made in charity, and what thine heart will answer thee, that thou mayest know the measure of thy profiting. For he has promised to show us in what we may know Him, and hath said, \"In this is love made perfectin us.\" Ask, in what? \"That we have boldness in the day of judgment.\" Whoso hath boldness in the day of judgment, in that man is charity made perfect. What is it to have boldness in the day of judgment? Not to fear lest the day of judgment should come. There are men who do not believe in a day of judgment; these cannot have boldness in a day which they do not believe will come. Let us pass these: may God awaken them, that they may live; why speak we of the dead? They do not believe that there will be a day of judgment; they neither fear nordesire what they do not believe. Some man has begun to believe in a day of judgment: if he has begun to believe, he has also begun to fear. But because he fears as yet, because he hath not yet boldness in the day of judgment, not yet is charity in that man made perfect. But for all that, is one to despair? In whom thou seest the beginning, why despairest thou of the end? What beginning do I see? (sayest thou.) That very fear. Hear the Scripture: \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"[fn-45-P4563_2462586:5-nf] Well then, he has begun to fear the day of judgment: by fearing let him correct himself, let him watch against his enemies, i.e. his sins; let him begin to come to life again inwardly, and to mortify his members which are upon the earth, as the apostle saith, \"Mortify your members which are upon the earth.\"[fn-45-P4564_2462918:6-nf] By the members upon earth he means spiritual wickedness:[fn-45-P4565_2462991:7-nf] for he goes on to expound it, \"Covetousness, uncleanness,\"[fn-45-P4566_2463076:8-nf] and the rest which he there follows out. Now in proportion as this man who has begun to fear the day of judgment, mortifies his members which are upon the earth, in that proportion the heavenly members rise up and are strengthened. But the heavenly members are all good works. As the heavenly members rise up, he begins to desire that which once he feared. Once he feared lest Christ should come and find in him the impious whom He must condemn; now he longs for Him to come, because He shall find the pious man whom He may crown. Having now begun to desire Christ's coming, the chaste soul which desires the embrace of the Bridegroom renounces the adulterer, becomes a virgin within by faith, hope, and charity. Now hath the man boldness in the day of judgment: he fights not against himself when he prays, \"Thy kingdom come.\"[fn-45-P4567_2463920:9-nf] For he that fears test the kingdom of God should come, fears lest his prayer be heard. How can he be said to pray, who fears lest his prayer be heard? But he that prays with boldness of charity, wishes now that He may come. Of this same desire said one in the Psalm, \"And thou, Lord, how long? Turn, Lord, and deliver my soul.\"[fn-45-P4568_2464266:10-nf] He groaned at being so put off. For there are men who with patience submit to die; but there are some perfect who with patience endure to live. What do I mean? When a person still desires this life, that person, when the day of death comes, patiently endures death: he struggles against himself that he may follow the will of God, and in his mind desires that which God chooseth, not what man's will chooseth: from desire of the present life there comes a reluctance against death, but yet he takes to him patience and fortitude, that he may with an even mind meet death; he dies patiently. But when a man desires, as the apostle saith, \"to be dissolved and to be with Christ,\"[fn-45-P4569_2464963:11-nf] that person, not patiently dies, but patiently lives, delightedly dies. See the apostle patiently living, i.e. how with patience he here, not loves life, but endures it. \"To be dissolved,\" saith be, \"and to be with Christ, is far better: but to continue in the flesh is necessary for your sakes.\" Therefore, brethren, do your endeavor, settle it inwardly with yourselves to make this your concern, that ye may desire the day of judgment. No otherwise is charity proved to be perfect, but only when one has begun to desire that day. But that man desires it, who hath boldness in it, whose conscience feels no alarm in perfect and sincere charity.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-01","text":"1.

But if in any man this is \"evil,\" i.e., not fortified by sound judgment and knowledge, or deceived by some error and presumption, it will mike our whole body \"full of darkness,\" i.e., it will darken all our mental vision and our actions, as they will be involved in the darkness of vices and the gloom of disturbances. For, says He, \"if the light which is in thee be darkness, how great will that darkness be!\"[fn-36-P3656_1365319:6-nf] For no one can doubt that when the judgment of our heart goes wrong, and is overwhelmed by the night of ignorance, our thoughts and deeds, which are the result of deliberation and discretion, must be involved in the darkness of still greater sins.","title":"II.

For, because He knew that we would make a good use of our substance which we should possess by receiving it from another, He says, \"He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.\"[fn-85-P8586_2426739:424-nf] And, \"For I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was naked and ye clothed Me.\"[fn-85-P8587_2426879:425-nf] And, \"When thou doest thine alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.\"[fn-85-P8588_2426994:426-nf] And we are proved to be righteous by whatsoever else we do well, redeeming, as it were, our property from strange hands. But thus do I say, \"from strange hands,\" not as if the world were not God's possession, but that we have gifts of this sort, and receive them from others, in the same way as these men had them from the Egyptians who knew not God; and by means of these same do we erect in ourselves the tabernacle of God: for God dwells in those who act uprightly, as the Lord says: \"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that they, when ye shall be put to flight,\"[fn-85-P8589_2427607:427-nf] may receive you into eternal tabernacles.\"[fn-85-P8590_2427799:428-nf] For whatsoever we acquired from unrighteousness when we were heathen, we are proved righteous, when we have become believers, by applying it to the Lord's advantage.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"ANF-01","text":"1.

And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom.

They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time.

Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished.

Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials.

But the faithful is called both servant and friend. So that if one loves himself, he loves the Lord, and confesses to salvation that he may save his soul. Though you die for your neighbour out of love, and regard the Saviour as our neighbour (for God who saves is said to be nigh in respect to what is saved); you do so, choosing death on account of life, and suffering for your own sake rather than his. And is it not for this that he is called brother? he who, suffering out of love to God, suffered for his own salvation; while he, on the other hand, who dies for his own salvation, endures for love to the Lord.

And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as serving the Lord and not men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer shall receive the Wrong, which he hath done; and there is no respect of persons.

And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which ye are called in one body; and be thankful.\"[fn-68-P6814_2073352:100-nf] For there is no obstacle to adducing frequently the same Scripture in order to put Marcion[fn-68-P6815_2073621:101-nf] to the blush, if perchance he be persuaded and converted; by learning that the faithful ought to be grateful to God the Creator, who hath called us, and who preached the Gospel in the body. From these considerations the unity of the faith is clear, and it is shown who is the perfect man; so that though some are reluctant, and offer as much resistance as they can, though menaced with punishments at the hand of husband or master, both the domestic and the wife will philosophize. Moreover, the free, though threatened with death at a tyrant's hands, and brought before the tribunals, and all his substances imperilled, will by no means abandon piety; nor will the wife who dwells with a wicked husband, or the son if he has a bad father, or the domestic if he has a bad master, ever fail in holding nobly to virtue. But as it is noble for a man to die for virtue, and for liberty, and for himself, so also is it for a woman. For this is not peculiar to the nature of males, but to the nature of the good. Accordingly, both the old man, the young, and the servant will live faithfully, and if need be die; which will be to be made alive by death. So we know that both children, and women, and servants have often, against their fathers', and masters', and husbands' will, reached the highest degree of excellence. Wherefore those who are determined to live piously ought none the less to exhibit alacrity, when some seem to exercise compulsion on them; but much more, I think, does it become them to show eagerness, and to strive with uncommon vigour, lest, being overcome, they abandon the best and most indispensable counsels. For it does not, I think, admit of comparison, whether it be better to be a follower of the Almighty than to choose the darkness of demons. For the things which are done by us on account of others we are to do always, endeavouring to have respect to those for whose sake it is proper that they be done, regarding the gratification rendered in their case, as what is to be our rule; but the things which are done for our own sake rather than that of others, are to be done with equal earnestness, whether they are like to please certain people or not. If some indifferent things have obtained such honour as to appear worthy of adoption, though against the will of some; much more is virtue to be regarded by us as worth contending for, looking the while to nothing but what can be rightly done, whether it seem good to others or not. Well then, Epicurus, writing to Menoeceus, says, \"Let not him who is young delay philosophizing, and let not the old man grow weary of philosophizing; for no one is either not of age or past age for attending to the health of his soul. And he who says that the time for philosophizing is not come or is past, is like the man who says that the time for happiness is not come or has gone. So that young[fn-68-P6816_2076523:102-nf] as well as old ought to philosophize: the one, in order that, while growing old, he may grow young in good things out of favour accruing from what is past; and the other, that he may be at once young and old, from want of fear for the future.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"224","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Such an one is no longer continent, but has reached a state of passionlessness, waiting to put on the divine image. \"If thou doest alms,\" it is said, \"let no one know it; and if thou fastest, anoint thyself, that God alone may know,\"[fn-70-P7023_2147999:208-nf] and not a single human being. Not even he himself who shows mercy ought to know that he does show mercy; for in this way he will be sometimes merciful, sometimes not. And when he shall do good by habit, he will imitate the nature of good, and his disposition will be his nature and his practice. There is no necessity for removing those who are raised on high, but there is necessity for those who are walking to reach the requisite goal, by passing over the whole of the narrow way. For this is to be drawn by the Father, to become worthy to receive the power of grace from God, so as to run without hindrance.

Therefore it will be much more accurate to denote God from the Son and to call Him Father, than to name Him and call Him Unoriginated from His works only; for the latter term refers to the works that have come to be at the will of God through the Word, but the name of Father points out the proper offspring from His essence. And whereas the Word surpasses things originated, by so muchand more also doth calling God Father surpass the calling Him Unoriginated; for the latter is non-scriptural and suspicious, as it has various senses; but the former is simple and scriptural, and more accurate, and alone implies the Son. And `Unoriginated' is a word of the Greeks who know not the Son: but `Father' has been acknowledged and vouchsafed by our Lord; for He knowing Himself whose Son He was, said, `I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-34-P3467_1394605:211-nf] ;' and, `He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;' and, `I and the Father are one[fn-34-P3468_1394723:212-nf] ;' but nowhere is He found to call the Father Unoriginated.

But if He wills that we should call His own Father our Father, we must not on that account measure ourselves with the Son according to nature, for it is because of the Son that the Father is so called by us; for since the Word bore our body and came to be in us, therefore by reason of the Word in us, is God called our Father.

I am afraid that, in avoiding the imputation of indifference at the hands of those who desire to know all that can be said about him, I shall incur a charge of prolixity from those whose ideal is the golden mean. For the latter Basil himself had the greatest respect, being specially devoted to the adage \"In all things the mean[fn-57-P5765_1969254:108-nf] is the best,\" and acting upon it throughout his life. Nevertheless, disregarding alike those who desire undue conciseness or excessive prolixity, I proceed thus with my speech. Different men attain success in different ways, some applying themselves to one alone of the many forms of excellence, but no one, of those hitherto known to me, arriving at the highest eminence in all respects; he being in my opinion the best, who has won his laurels on the widest field, or gained the highest possible renown in some single particular. Such however was the height of Basil's fame, that he became the pride of human kind. Let us consider the matter thus. Is any one devoted to poverty and a life devoid of property, and free from superfluity? What did he possess besides his body, and the necessary coverings of the flesh? His wealth was the having nothing, and he thought the cross, with which he lived, more precious than great riches. For no one, however much he may wish, can obtain possession of all things, hut any one can learn to despise, and so prove himself superior to, all things. Such being his mind, and such his life, he had no need of an altar and of vainglory, nor of such a public announcement as \"Crates[fn-57-P5766_1970566:109-nf] sets Crates the Theban free.\" For his aim was ever to be, not to seem, most excellent. Nor did he dwell in a tub,[fn-57-P5767_1970718:110-nf] and in the midst of the market-place, and so by luxuriating in publicity turn his poverty into riches: but was poor and unkempt, yet without ostentation: and taking cheerfully the casting overboard of all that he ever had, sailed lightly across the sea of life.","title":"Oration XLIII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":6,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_55_oration_xliii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"63. What more? A noble thing is philanthropy, and the support of the poor, and the assistance of human weakness.

Why should I compare with this work Thebes[fn-57-P5777_1975542:117-nf] of the seen portals, and the Egyptian Thebes, and the walls of Babylon, and the Carian tomb of Mausolus, and the Pyramids, and the bronze without weight of the Colossus, or the size and beauty of shrines that are no more, and all the other objects of men's wonder, and historic record, from which their founders gained no advantage, except a slight meed of fame. My subject is the most wonderful of all, the short road to salvation, the easiest ascent to heaven. There is no longer before our eyes that terrible and piteous spectacle of men who are living corpses, the greater part of whose limbs have mortified, driven away from their cities and homes and public places and fountains, aye, and from their own dearest ones, recognizable by their names rather than by their features: they are no longer brought before us at our gatherings and meetings, in our common intercourse and union, no longer the objects of hatred, instead of pity on account of their disease; composers of piteous songs, if any of them have their voice still left to them. Why should I try to express in tragic style all our experiences, when no language can be adequate to their hard lot? He however it was, who took the lead in pressing upon those who were men, that they ought not to despise their fellowmen, nor to dishonour Christ, the one Head of all, by their inhuman treatment of them; but to use the misfortunes of others as an opportunity of firmly establishing their own lot, and to lend to God that mercy of which they stand in need at His hands. He did not therefore disdain to honour with his lips this disease, noble and of noble ancestry and brilliant reputation though he was, but saluted them as brethren, not, as some might suppose, from vainglory, (for who was so far removed from this feeling?) but taking the lead in approaching to tend them, as a consequence of his philosophy, and so giving not only a speaking, but also a silent, instruction. The effect produced is to be seen not only in the city, but in the country and beyond, and even the leaders of society have vied with one another in their philanthropy and magnanimity towards them. Others have had their cooks, and splendid tables, and the devices and dainties of confectioners, and exquisite carriages, and soft, flowing robes; Basil's care was for the sick, and the relief of their wounds, and the imitation of Christ, by cleansing leprosy, not by a word, but in deed.","title":"Oration XLIII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":54,"source_paragraph":"279","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"121.

For do you think, Brethren, that God doth not know what is needful for you? He knoweth and preventeth our desires, who knoweth our want. And so when He taught His disciples to pray, and warned them not to use many words in prayer, He saith, \"Use not many words; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask Him.\"[fn-43-P4346_1841706:3-nf] Now the Lord saith something different from this. What is this? Because He misliked that we should use many words in prayer, He said to us, \"When ye pray, use not many words; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask Him.\" If our \"Father knoweth what things we have need of before we ask Him,\" why do we use even few words? What is the use of prayer at all, if \"our Father knoweth\" already \"what things we have need of\"? He saith to one, Do not make thy prayer to Me at great length; for I know what is needful for thee. If so, Lord, why should I so much as pray at all? Thou wouldest not that I should use long prayers, yea rather Thou dost even bid me to use near none at all. And then what meaneth that precept in another place? For He who saith, \"Use not many words in prayer,\" saith in another place, \"Ask, and it shall be given you.\"[fn-43-P4347_1842589:4-nf] And that thou mightest not think that this first precept to ask was given cursorily, He added, \"Seek, and ye shall find.\" And that thou mightest not think that this too was cursorily given, see what He added further, see with what He finished. \"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you:\" see what He added. He would have thee ask that thou mayest receive, and seek that thou mayest find, and knock that thou mayest enter in. Seeing then that our Father knoweth already what is needful for us, how and why do we ask? why seek? why knock? why weary ourselves in asking, and seeking, and knocking, to instruct Him who knoweth already? And in another place the words of the Lord are, \"Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.\"[fn-43-P4348_1843331:5-nf] If men \"ought always to pray,\" how doth He say, \"Use not many words\"? How can I always pray, if I so quickly make an end? Here Thou biddest me to finish quickly; there \"always to pray and not to faint:\" what doth this mean? Now that thou mayest understand this, \"ask, seek, knock.\" For for this cause is it closed, not to shut thee out, but to exercise thee. Therefore, brethren, ought we to exhort to prayer, both ourselves and you. For other hope have we none amid the manifold evils of this present world, than to knock in prayer, to believe and to maintain the belief firm in the heart, that thy Father only doth not give thee what He knoweth is not expedient for thee. For thou knowest what thou dost desire; He knoweth what is good for thee. Imagine thyself under a physician, and in weak health, as is the very truth; for all this life of ours is a weakness; and a long life is nothing else but a prolonged weakness. Imagine thyself then to be sick under the physician's hand. Thou hast a desire to ask thy physician leave to drink a draught of fresh wine. Thou art not prohibited from asking, for it may chance to do thee no harm, or even good to receive it. Do not then hesitate to ask; ask, hesitate not; but if thou receive not, do not take it to heart. Now if thou wouldest act thus in the hands of a man, the physician of the body, how much more in the hands of God, who is the Physician, the Creator, and Restorer, both of thy body and soul?","title":"Sermon XXX.

When the Churches were too small, and the people so numerous as they were, and desirous to go forth into the deserts, what ought I to have done? The desert has no doors, and all who choose may pass through it, but the Lord's house is enclosed with walls and doors, and marks the difference between the pious and the profane. Will not every wise person then, as well as your Piety, Sire, give the preference to the latter place? For they know that here prayer is lawfully offered, while a suspicion of irregularity attaches to it there. Unless indeed no place proper for it existed, and the worshippers dwelt only in the desert, as was the case with Israel; although after the tabernacle was built, they also had thenceforth a place set apart for prayer. O Christ, Lord and true King of kings, Only-begotten Son of God, Word and Wisdom of the Father, I am accused because the people prayed Thy gracious favour, and through Thee besought Thy Father, who is God over all, to save Thy servant, the most religious Constantius. But thanks be to Thy goodness, that it is for this that I am blamed, and for the keeping of Thy laws. Heavier had been the blame, and more true had been the charge, had we passed by the place which the Emperor was building, and gone forth into the desert to pray.

For since in speaking of hell and punishment, it seemed he would not at present be credible to the ungodly and deliberate choosers of such a life, but even scorned, he shows that the punishment was in this pleasure itself. (So Plato Theoet. p. 176, 7.) But if they perceive it not, but are still pleased, be not amazed. For even they that are mad, and are afflicted with phrenzy (cf. Soph. Aj. 265-277) while doing themselves much injury and making themselves such objects of compassion, that others weep over them themselves smile and revel over what has happened. Yet we do not only for this not say that they are quit of punishment, but for this very reason are under a more grievous vengeance, in that they are unconscious of the plight they are in. For it is not the disordered but those who are sound whose votes one has to gain. Yet of old the matter seemed even to be a law,[fn-20-P2074_2067618:6-nf] and a certain law-giver among them bade the domestic slaves neither to use unguents when dry (i.e. except in bathing) nor to keep youths, giving the free this place of honor, or rather of shamefulness. Yet they, however, did not think the thing shameful, but as being a grand privilege, and one too great for slaves, the Athenian people, the wisest of people, and Solon who is so great amongst them, permitted it to the free alone. And sundry other books of the philosophers may one see full of this disease. But we do not therefore say that the thing was made lawful, but that they who received this law were pitiable, and objects for many tears. For these are treated in the same way as women that play the whore. Or rather their plight is more miserable. For in the case of the one the intercourse, even if lawless, is yet according to nature: but this is contrary both to law and nature. For even if there were no hell, and no punishment had been threatened, this were worse than any punishment. Yet if you say \"they found pleasure in it,\" you tell me what adds to the vengeance. For suppose I were to see a person running naked, with his body all besmeared with mire, and yet not covering himself, but exulting in it, I should not rejoice with him, but should rather bewail that he did not even perceive that he was doing shamefully. But that I may show the atrocity in a yet clearer light, bear with me in one more example. Now if any one condemned a virgin to live in close dens (qalomeuomenhn), and to have intercourse with unreasoning brutes, and then she was pleased with such intercourse, would she not for this be especially a worthy object of tears, as being unable to be freed from this misery owing to her not even perceiving the misery? It is plain surely to every one. But if that were a grievous thing, neither is this less so than that. For to be insulted by one's own kinsmen is more piteous than to be so by strangers: these I say (5 mss. \"I consider\") are even worse than murderers: since to die even is better than to live under such insolency. For the murderer dissevers the soul from the body, but this man ruins the soul with the body. And name what sin you will, none will you mention equal to this lawlessness. And if they that suffer such things perceived them, they would accept ten thousand deaths so they might not suffer this evil. For there is not, there surely is not, a more grievous evil than this insolent dealing. For if when discoursing about fornication Paul said, that \"Every sin which a man doeth is without the body, but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body\" (1 Cor. vi. 18); what shall we say of this madness, which is so much worse than fornication as cannot even be expressed? For I should not only say that thou hast become a woman, but that thou hast lost thy manhood, and hast neither changed into that nature nor kept that which thou haddest, but thou hast been a traitor to both of them at once, and deserving both of men and women to be driven out and stoned, as having wronged either sex. And that thou mayest learn what the real force of this is, if any one were to come and assure you that he would make you a dog instead of being a man, would you not flee from him as a plague? But, lo! thou hast not made thyself a dog out of a man, but an animal more disgraceful than this. For this is useful unto service, but he that hath thus given himself up is serviceable for nothing. Or again, if any one threatened to make men travail and be brought to bed, should we not be filled with indignation? But lo! now they that have run into this fury have done more grievously by themselves. For it is not the same thing to change into the nature of women, as to continue a man and yet to have become a woman; or rather neither this nor that. But if you would know the enormity of the evil from other grounds, ask on what account the lawgivers punish them that make men eunuchs, and you will see that it is absolutely for no other reason than because they mutilate nature. And yet the injustice they do is nothing to this. For there have been those that were mutilated and were in many cases useful after their mutilation. But nothing can there be more worthless than a man who has pandered himself. For not the soul only, but the body also of one who hath been so treated, is disgraced, and deserves to be driven out everywhere. How many hells shall be enough for such? But if thou scoffest at hearing of hell and believest not that fire, remember Sodom. For we have seen, surely we have seen, even in this present life, a semblance of hell. For since many would utterly disbelieve the things to come after the resurrection, hearing now of an unquenchable fire, God brings them to a right mind by things present. For such is the burning of Sodom, and that conflagration! And they know it well that have been at the place, and have seen with their eyes that scourge divinely sent, and the effect of the lightnings from above. (Jude 7.) Consider how great is that sin, to have forced hell to appear even before its time! For whereas many thought scorn of His words, by His deeds did God show them the image thereof in a certain novel way. For that rain was unwonted, for that the intercourse was contrary to nature, and it deluged the land, since lust had done so with their souls. Wherefore also the rain was the opposite of the customary rain. Now not only did it fail to stir up the womb of the earth to the production of fruits, but made it even useless for the reception of seed. For such was also the intercourse of the men, making a body of this sort more worthless than the very land of Sodom. And what is there more detestable than a man who hath pandered himself, or what more execrable? Oh, what madness! Oh, what distraction! Whence came this lust lewdly revelling and making man's nature all that enemies could? or even worse than that, by as much as the soul is better than the body. Oh, ye that were more senseless than irrational creatures, and more shameless than dogs! for in no case does such intercourse take place with them, but nature acknowledgeth her own limits. But ye have even made our race dishonored below things irrational, by such indignities inflicted upon and by each other. Whence then were these evils born? Of luxury; of not knowing God.

Cease to do evil, learn to do well. Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed: judge the orphan, defend the widow. And come, reason with Me, saith the Lord: and though your sins were as scarlet, yet shall they be as white as snow, though they were red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool.\"[fn-62-P6256_2236289:17-nf] Sometimes too the pardon of our sins is obtained by the intercession of the saints, for \"if a man knows his brother to sin a sin not unto death, he asks, and He will give to him his life, for him that sinneth not unto death;\" and again: \"Is any sick among you? Let him send for the Elders of the Church and they shall pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.\"[fn-62-P6257_2236838:18-nf] Sometimes too by the virtue of compassion and faith the stains of sin are removed, according to this passage: \"By compassion and faith sins are purged away.\"[fn-62-P6258_2237019:19-nf] And often by the conversion and salvation of those who are saved by our warnings and preaching: \"For he who converts a sinner from the error of his way, shall save his soul from death, and cover a multitude of sins\"[fn-62-P6259_2237254:20-nf] Moreover by pardon and forgiveness on our part we obtain pardon of our sins: \"For if ye forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your sins.\"[fn-62-P6260_2237446:21-nf] You see then what great means of obtaining mercy the compassion of our Saviour has laid open to us, so that no one when longing for salvation need be crushed by despair, as he sees himself called to life by so many remedies. For if you plead that owing to weakness of the flesh you cannot get rid of your sins by fasting, and you cannot say: \"My knees are weak from fasting, and my flesh is changed for oil; for I have eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,\"[fn-62-P6261_2237949:22-nf] then atone for them by profuse almsgiving. If you have nothing that you can give to the needy (although the claims of want and poverty exclude none from thisoffice, since the two mites of the widow are ranked higher than the splendid gifts of the rich, and the Lord promises that He will give a reward for a cup of cold water), at least you can purge them away by amendment of life. But if you cannot secure perfection in goodness by the eradication of all your faults, you can show a pious anxiety for the good and salvation of another. But if you complain that you are not equal to this service, you can cover your sins by the affection of love. And if in this also some sluggishness of mind makes you weak, at least you should submissively with a feeling of humility entreat for remedies for your wounds by the prayers and intercession of the saints. Finally who is there who cannot humbly say: \"I have acknowledged my sin: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid;\" so that by this confession he may be able also to add this: \"And Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart.\"[fn-62-P6262_2239067:23-nf] But if shame holds you back, and you blush to reveal them before men, you should not cease to confess them with constant supplication to Him from Whom they cannot be hid, and to say to Him: \"I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.

Let not the stubbornness of an obdurate heart turn away any from the saving remedy and the fount of so much goodness, because even if we have done all these things, they will not be able to expiate our offences, unless they are blotted out by the goodness and mercy of the Lord, who when He sees the service of pious efforts offered by us with a humble heart, supports our small and puny efforts with the utmost bounty, and says: \"I even I am He that blotteth out thine iniquities for Mine own sake, and I will remember thy sins no more.\"[fn-62-P6266_2240553:26-nf] Whoever then is aiming at this condition, which we have mentioned, will seek the grace of satisfaction by daily fasting and mortification of heart and body, for, as it is written, \"Without shedding of blood there is no remission;\"[fn-62-P6267_2240805:27-nf] and this not without good reason. For \"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-62-P6268_2240914:28-nf] And therefore one who would withhold \"the sword of the spirit which is the word of God\"[fn-62-P6269_2241022:29-nf] from this shedding of blood certainly comes under the lash of that curse of Jeremiah's; for \"Cursed,\" says he \"is he who withholds his sword from blood.\"[fn-62-P6270_2241194:30-nf] For this is the sword which for our good sheds that bad blood whereby the material of our sins lives; and cuts Off and pares away everything carnal and earthly which it finds to have grown up in the members of our soul; and makes men die to sin and live to God, and flourish with spiritual virtues. And so he will begin to weep no more at the recollection of former sins, but at the hope of what is to come, and, thinking less of past evils than of good things to come, will shed tears not from sorrow at his sins, but from delight in that eternal joy, and \"forgetting those things which are behind,\" i.e., carnal sins, will press on \"to those before,\"[fn-62-P6271_2241869:31-nf] i.e., to spiritual gifts and virtues.","title":"XX.

Who when ministering support to the poor, or when receiving with benevolent kindness the crowds that come to him, can at the very moment when he is with anxious mind perplexed for the wants of his brethren, contemplate the vastness of the bliss on high, and while he is shaken by the troubles and cares of the present life look forward to the state of the world to come with an heart raised above the stains of earth? Whence the blessed David when laying down that this alone is good for man, longs to cling constantly to God, and says: \"It is good for me to cling to God, and to put my hope in the Lord.\"[fn-65-P6559_2341472:21-nf] And Ecclesiastes also declares that this cannot be done without fault by any of the saints, and says: \"For there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.\"[fn-65-P6560_2341684:22-nf] For who, even if he be the chief of all righteous and holy men, can we ever think could, while bound in the chains of this life, so acquire this chief good, as never to cease from divine contemplation, or be thought to be drawn away by earthly thoughts even for a short time from Him Who alone is good? Who ever takes no care for food, none for clothing or other carnal things, or when anxious about receiving the brethren, or change of place, or building his cell, has never desired the aid of man's assistance, nor when harassed by scarcity and want has incurred this sentence of reproof from the Lord: \"Be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat, nor for your body what ye shall put on\"?[fn-65-P6561_2342399:23-nf] Further we confidently assert that even the Apostle Paul himself who surpassed in the number of his sufferings the toils of all the saints, could not possibly fulfil this, as he himself testifies to the disciples in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to the needs of those who were with me,\" or when in writing in the Thessalonians he testifies that he \"worked in labour and weariness night and day.\"[fn-65-P6562_2342883:24-nf] And although for this there were great rewards for his merits prepared, yet his mind, however holy and sublime it might be, could not help being sometimes drawn away from that heavenly contemplation by its attention to earthly labours. Further, when he saw himsetf enriched with such practical fruits, and on theother hand considered in his heart the good of meditation, and weighed as it were in one scale the profit of all these labours and in the other the delights of divine contemplation, when for a long time he had corrected the balance in his breast, while the vast rewards for his labours delighted him on one side, and on the other the desire for unity with and the inseparable companionship of Christ inclined him to depart this life, at last in his perplexity he cries out and says: \"What I shall choose I know not. For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, for it were much better: but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes.\"[fn-65-P6563_2343915:25-nf] Though then in many ways he preferred this excellent good to all the fruits of his preaching, yet he submits himself in consideration of love, without which none can gain the Lord; and for their sakes, whom hitherto he had soothed with milk as nourishment from the breasts of the gospel, does not refuse to be parted from Christ, which is bad for himself though useful for others. For he is driven to choose this the rather by that excessive goodness of his whereby for the salvation of his brethren he is ready, were it possible, to incur even the last evil of an Anathema. \"For I could wish,\" he says, \"that I myself were Anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites,\"[fn-65-P6564_2344669:26-nf] i.e., I could wish to be subject not only to temporal, but even to perpetual punishment, if only all men, were it possible, might enjoy the fellowship of Christ: for I am sure that the salvation of all would be better for Christ and for me than my own. That then the Apostle might perfectly gain this chief good, i.e., to enjoy the vision of God and to be joined continually to Christ, he was ready to be parted from this body, which as it is feeble and hindered by the many requirements of its frailties cannot help separating from union with Christ: for it is impossible for the mind, that is harassed by such frequent cares, and hampered by such various and tiresome troubles, always to enjoy the Divine vision. For what aim of the saints can be so persistent, what purpose can be so high that that crafty plotter does not sometimes destroy it? Who has frequented the recesses of the desert and shunned intercourse with all men in such a way that he never trips by unnecessary thoughts, and by looking on things or being occupied in earthly actions falls away from that contemplation of God, which truly alone is good? Who ever could preserve such fervour of spirit as not sometimes to pass by roving thoughts from his attention to prayer, and fall away suddenly from heavenly to earthly things? Which of us (to pass over other times of wandering) even at the very moment when heraises his soul in prayer to God on high, does not fall into a sort of stupor, and even against his will offend by that very thing from which he hoped for pardon of his sins? Who, I ask, is so alert and vigilant as never, while he is singing a Psalm to God, to allow his mind to wander from the meaning of Scripture? Who is so intimate with and closely joined to God, as to congratulate himself on having carried out for a single day that rule of the Apostle's, whereby he bids us pray without ceasing?[fn-65-P6565_2346575:27-nf] And though all these things may seem to some, who are involved in grosser sins, to be trivial and altogether foreign to sin, yet to those who know the value of perfection a quantity even of very small matters becomes most serious.","title":"XXIII.

If then it be not unworthy of God to exercise His Providence, even down to things so small, a hair of the head, and a sparrow, and the grass of the field, also it was not unworthy of Him to make them. For what things are the subjects of His Providence, of those He is Maker through His proper Word. Nay a worse absurdity lies before the men who thus speak; for they distinguish[fn-59-P5999_2393107:161-nf] between the creatures and the framing; and consider the latter the work of the Father, the creatures the work of the Son; whereas either all things must be brought to be by the with the Son, or if all that is originate comes to be through the Son, we must not call Him one of the originated things.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":6,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_88_homily_xxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"Let us walk becomingly,\" (A.

For if they who lived from their labor, and were managers of a workshop, exhibited such profuseness as to be of service to many Churches; what pardon can they expect, who are rich, and yet neglect the poor? For they were not sparing even of their blood for the sake of God's will, but thou art sparing even of scanty sums, and many times sparest not thine own soul. But in regard to the teacher were they so, and not so with regard to the disciples? Nay even this cannot be said. For \"the churches of the Gentiles,\" he says, \"thank them.\" And yet they were of the Jews. But still they had such a clear (eilikrinpwj) faith, as to minister unto them also with all willingness. Such ought women to be, not adorning themselves with \"broidered hair, or gold, or costly array\" (1 Tim. ii. 9), but in these good deeds. For what empress pray, was so conspicuous or so celebrated as this wife of the tent-maker? she is in everybody's mouth, not for ten or twenty years, but until the coming of Christ, and all proclaim her fame for things such as adorn far more than any royal diadem. For what is greater or so great, as to have been a succorer of Paul? at her own peril to have saved the teacher of the world? And consider: how many empresses there are that no one speaks of. But the wife of the tent-maker is everywhere reported of with the tent-maker (meaning perhaps St. Paul); and the width that the sun sees over, is no more of the world than what the glory of this woman runneth unto. Persians, and Scythians, and Thracians, and they who dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth, sing of the Christian spirit of this woman, and bless it.[fn-33-P3360_3089669:10-nf] How much wealth, how many diadems and purples would you not be glad to venture upon obtaining such a testimony? For no one can say either, that in dangers they were of this character, and lavish with their money, and yet neglected the preaching. For he calls them \"fellow-workers and helpers\" on this ground. And this \"chosen vessel\" (Acts ix. 15) does not feel ashamed to call a woman his helper but even finds an honor in doing so. For it is not the sex (fisei) that he minds, but the will is what he honors. What is equal to this ornament? Where now is wealth overflowing on every side? and where the adorning of the person? and where is vainglory? Learn that the dress of woman is not that put about the body, but that which decorates the soul, which is never put off, which does not lie in a chest, but is laid up in the heavens. Look at their labor for the preaching, the crown in martyrdom, the munificence in money, the love of Paul, the charm (filtron) they found in Christ. Compare with this thine own estate, thy anxiety about money, thy vying with harlots (i. e. in dress), thy emulating of the grass,[fn-33-P3361_3090809:11-nf] and then thou wilt see who they were and who thou art. Or rather do not compare only, but vie with this woman, and after laying aside the burdens of grass (xlohj), (for this is what thy costly dressing is), take thou the dress from heaven, and learn whence Priscilla became such as she was. How then did they become so? For two years they entertained Paul as a guest: (Probably Acts xix. 10) and what is there that these two years may not have done for their souls? What am I to do then, you will say because I have not Paul? If thou be minded thou mayest have him in a truer sense than they. For even with them the sight of Paul was not what made them of such a character, but the words of Paul. And so, if thou be so minded, thou shall have both Paul, and Peter, and John, and the whole choir of the Prophets, with the Apostles, associating with thee continually. For take the books of these blessed ones, and hold a continual intercourse with their writings, and they will be able to make thee like the tent-maker's wife. And why speak I of Paul? For if thou wilt, thou mayest have Paul's Master Himself. For through Paul's tongue even He will discourse with thee. And in another way again thou wilt be able to receive this Person, when thou receivest the saints, even when thou tendest those that believe on Him. And so even after their departure thou wilt have many memorials of piety. For even the table at which the saint ate, and a seat on which he sat, and the couch on which he lay knoweth how to pierce[fn-33-P3362_3092420:12-nf] him that received him; even after his departure. How then, think you, was that Shunamite pierced at entering the upper chamber where Elisha abode, when she saw the table, the couch on which the holy man slept; and what religiousness must she have felt come from it?[fn-33-P3363_3092726:13-nf] For had this not been so, she would not have cast the child there when dead, if she had not reaped great benefit from thence. For if so long time after upon entering in where Paul abode, where he was bound, where he sat and discoursed,[fn-33-P3364_3093038:14-nf] we are elevated, and find ourselves starting off from the places to that memory (so Field: Vulg. \"the memory of that day\"); when the circumstances were still fresher, what must those have been likely to feel, who had religiously entertained him? Knowing all this then, let us receive the Saints, that the house may shine, that it may be freed from choking thorns, that the bedchamber may become a haven. And let us receive them, and wash their feet. Thou art not better than Sarah, nor more noble, nor more wealthy, though thou be an empress. For she had three hundred and eighteen homeborn servants, at a time when to have two servants even was to be wealthy. And why do I mention the three hundred and eighteen servants? She had become possessed of the whole world in her seed and in the promises, she had the \"friend of God\" (Is. xli. 8; James ii. 23) for her husband, God Himself as a Patron, a thing greater than any kingdom. And yet, though she was in so illustrious and honorable estate, this woman kneaded the flour, and did all the other servant's offices, and stood by them as they banqueted too in the rank of a servant. Thou art not of nobler birth than Abraham, who yet did the part of domestics after his exploits after his victories, after the honor paid him by the king of Egypt, after driving out the kings of the Persians, and raising the glorious trophies. And look not to this; that in appearance the Saints that lodge with thee are but poor, and as beggars, and in rags many times, but be mindful of that voice which says, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these, ye have done it unto me.\" (Matt. xxv. 40.) And, \"Despise not one of these little ones, because their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" (Matt. xviii. 10.) Receive them then with readiness of mind, bringing as they do ten thousand blessings to thee, through the greeting of peace. (ib. x. 12, 13.) And after Sarah, reflect upon Rebecca also, who both drew water and gave to drink, and called the stranger in, trampling down all haughtiness. However, through this, great were the rewards of hospitality she received! And thou, if thou be so minded, wilt receive even greater than those. For it will not be the fruit of children only that God will give thee, but the heaven, and the blessings there, and a freedom from hell, and a remission of sins. For great, yea, very great, is the fruit of hospitality. (Luke xi. 41.) Thus too Jethro, and that though he was a foreigner, gained for a relation him who with so great power commanded the sea. (Dan. iv. 27; Ex. iii. 1.) For his daughters too drew into his net this honorable prey. (Num. x. 29.) Setting then thy thoughts upon these things, and reflecting upon the manly and heroic[fn-33-P3365_3095907:15-nf] temper of those women, trample upon the gorgeousness of this day, the adornments of dress, the costly jewelry, the anointing with perfumes. And have done with those wanton[fn-33-P3366_3096200:16-nf] and delicate airs, and that mincing walk, and turn all this attentiveness unto the soul, and kindle up in thy mind a longing for the heavens. For should but his love take hold of thee, thou wilt discern the mire and the clay, and ridicule the things now so admired. For it is not even possible for a woman adorned with spiritual attainments to be seeking after this ridiculousness. Having then cast this aside, which wives of the lewder sort of men, and actresses, and singers, have so much ambition in, clothe thee with the love of wisdom, with hospitality, with the succoring of the Saints, with compunction, with continual prayer. These be better than cloth of gold, these more stately than jewels and[fn-33-P3367_3096948:17-nf] than necklaces,[fn-33-P3368_3097017:18-nf] these both make thee of good repute among men, and bring thee great reward with God. This is the dress of the Church, that of the playhouses. This is worthy of the heaven, that, of horses and mules; that is put even round dead corpses, this shineth in a good soul alone wherein Christ dwelleth. Let this then be the dress for us to acquire, that we also may have our praise sung everywhere, and be well-pleasing to Christ, by Whom and with Whom, etc. Amen.

How then did they become so? For two years they entertained Paul as a guest: (Probably Acts xix. 10) and what is there that these two years may not have done for their souls? What am I to do then, you will say because I have not Paul? If thou be minded thou mayest have him in a truer sense than they. For even with them the sight of Paul was not what made them of such a character, but the words of Paul. And so, if thou be so minded, thou shall have both Paul, and Peter, and John, and the whole choir of the Prophets, with the Apostles, associating with thee continually. For take the books of these blessed ones, and hold a continual intercourse with their writings, and they will be able to make thee like the tent-maker's wife. And why speak I of Paul? For if thou wilt, thou mayest have Paul's Master Himself. For through Paul's tongue even He will discourse with thee. And in another way again thou wilt be able to receive this Person, when thou receivest the saints, even when thou tendest those that believe on Him. And so even after their departure thou wilt have many memorials of piety. For even the table at which the saint ate, and a seat on which he sat, and the couch on which he lay knoweth how to pierce[fn-33-P3362_3092420:12-nf] him that received him; even after his departure. How then, think you, was that Shunamite pierced at entering the upper chamber where Elisha abode, when she saw the table, the couch on which the holy man slept; and what religiousness must she have felt come from it?[fn-33-P3363_3092726:13-nf] For had this not been so, she would not have cast the child there when dead, if she had not reaped great benefit from thence. For if so long time after upon entering in where Paul abode, where he was bound, where he sat and discoursed,[fn-33-P3364_3093038:14-nf] we are elevated, and find ourselves starting off from the places to that memory (so Field: Vulg. \"the memory of that day\"); when the circumstances were still fresher, what must those have been likely to feel, who had religiously entertained him? Knowing all this then, let us receive the Saints, that the house may shine, that it may be freed from choking thorns, that the bedchamber may become a haven. And let us receive them, and wash their feet. Thou art not better than Sarah, nor more noble, nor more wealthy, though thou be an empress. For she had three hundred and eighteen homeborn servants, at a time when to have two servants even was to be wealthy. And why do I mention the three hundred and eighteen servants? She had become possessed of the whole world in her seed and in the promises, she had the \"friend of God\" (Is. xli. 8; James ii. 23) for her husband, God Himself as a Patron, a thing greater than any kingdom. And yet, though she was in so illustrious and honorable estate, this woman kneaded the flour, and did all the other servant's offices, and stood by them as they banqueted too in the rank of a servant. Thou art not of nobler birth than Abraham, who yet did the part of domestics after his exploits after his victories, after the honor paid him by the king of Egypt, after driving out the kings of the Persians, and raising the glorious trophies. And look not to this; that in appearance the Saints that lodge with thee are but poor, and as beggars, and in rags many times, but be mindful of that voice which says, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these, ye have done it unto me.\" (Matt. xxv. 40.) And, \"Despise not one of these little ones, because their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" (Matt. xviii. 10.) Receive them then with readiness of mind, bringing as they do ten thousand blessings to thee, through the greeting of peace. (ib. x. 12, 13.) And after Sarah, reflect upon Rebecca also, who both drew water and gave to drink, and called the stranger in, trampling down all haughtiness. However, through this, great were the rewards of hospitality she received! And thou, if thou be so minded, wilt receive even greater than those. For it will not be the fruit of children only that God will give thee, but the heaven, and the blessings there, and a freedom from hell, and a remission of sins. For great, yea, very great, is the fruit of hospitality. (Luke xi. 41.) Thus too Jethro, and that though he was a foreigner, gained for a relation him who with so great power commanded the sea. (Dan. iv. 27; Ex. iii. 1.) For his daughters too drew into his net this honorable prey. (Num. x. 29.) Setting then thy thoughts upon these things, and reflecting upon the manly and heroic[fn-33-P3365_3095907:15-nf] temper of those women, trample upon the gorgeousness of this day, the adornments of dress, the costly jewelry, the anointing with perfumes. And have done with those wanton[fn-33-P3366_3096200:16-nf] and delicate airs, and that mincing walk, and turn all this attentiveness unto the soul, and kindle up in thy mind a longing for the heavens. For should but his love take hold of thee, thou wilt discern the mire and the clay, and ridicule the things now so admired. For it is not even possible for a woman adorned with spiritual attainments to be seeking after this ridiculousness. Having then cast this aside, which wives of the lewder sort of men, and actresses, and singers, have so much ambition in, clothe thee with the love of wisdom, with hospitality, with the succoring of the Saints, with compunction, with continual prayer. These be better than cloth of gold, these more stately than jewels and[fn-33-P3367_3096948:17-nf] than necklaces,[fn-33-P3368_3097017:18-nf] these both make thee of good repute among men, and bring thee great reward with God. This is the dress of the Church, that of the playhouses. This is worthy of the heaven, that, of horses and mules; that is put even round dead corpses, this shineth in a good soul alone wherein Christ dwelleth. Let this then be the dress for us to acquire, that we also may have our praise sung everywhere, and be well-pleasing to Christ, by Whom and with Whom, etc. Amen.

I would then that thou shouldest forgive, seeing that I find thee asking forgiveness. Thou art asked, forgive: thou art asked, and thou wilt ask thyself; thou art asked, forgive; thou wilt ask to be forgiven; for, lo, the time of prayer will come: I have thee fist in the words thou wilt have to speak. Thou wilt say, \"Our Father, which art in heaven.\" For thou wilt not be in the number of children, if thou shalt not say, \"Our Father.\" So then thou wilt say, \"Our Father, which art in heaven.\" Follow on; \"Hallowed be Thy Name.\" Say on, \"Thy kingdom come.\" Follow still on, \"Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.\" See what thou addest next, \"Give us this day our daily bread.\"[fn-56-P5671_2399554:9-nf] Where are thy riches? So thou art a beggar. Nevertheless in the mean while (it is the point I am speaking of), say what is next after, \"Give us this day our daily bread.\" Say what follows this: \"Forgive us our debts.\" Now thou hast come to my words, \"Forgive us our debts.\" By what right? by what covenant? on what condition? on what express stipulation? \"As we also forgive our debtors.\" It is but a small thing that thou dost not forgive; yea thou dost more, thou liest unto God. The condition is laid down, the law fixed. \"Forgive as I forgive.\" Therefore He does not forgive, unless thou forgivest. \"Forgive as I forgive.\" Thou wishest to be forgiven when thou askest, forgive him that asks of thee. He that is skilled in heaven's laws[fn-56-P5672_2400316:10-nf] has dictated these prayers: He does not deceive thee; ask according to the tenor of His heavenly voice: say, \"Forgive us, as we also forgive,\" and do what thou sayest. He that lies in his prayers, loses the benefit he seeks: he that lies in his prayers, both loses his cause, and finds his punishment. And if any one lies to the emperor, he is convicted of his lie at his coming: but when thou liest in prayer, thou by thy very prayer art convicted. For God does not seek for witness as regards thee to convict thee. He who dictated the prayers to thee, is thine Advocate: if thou liest, He is a witness against thee: if thou dost not amend thyself, He will be thy Judge. So then both say it, and do. For if thou say it not, thou wilt not obtain making thy requests contrary to the law; but if thou say it and do it not, thou wilt be further guilty of lying. There is no means of evading that verse, save by fulfilling what we say. Can we blot this verse out of our prayer? Would ye that clause, \"Forgive us our debts,\" should be there, and that we should blot out what follows, \"As we also forgive our debtors \"? Thou shalt not blot it out, lest thou be first blotted out thyself. So then in this prayer thou sayest, \"Give,\" and thou sayest, \"Forgive:\" that thou mayest receive what thou hast not, and may be forgiven what thou hast done amiss. So then thou wishest to receive, give; thou wishest to be forgiven, forgive. It is a brief summary. Hear Christ Himself in another place, \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.\" What will ye forgive? What others have sinned against you. What shall ye be forgiven? What ye have sinned yourselves. \"Forgive.\" \"Give, and there shall be given you what ye desire,\"[fn-56-P5673_2402039:11-nf] eternal life.

But we have received, as it were, an earnest of the eternal blessings, and of the ancestral riches. The provisions for the Lord's way are the Lord's beatitudes. For He said: \"Seek,\" and anxiously seek, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you: for the Father knoweth what things ye have need of.\"[fn-7-P750_202426:25-nf] Thus He limits not only our occupations, but our cares.

But what are we to say of the hireling? He is not mentioned here among the good. \"The good Shepherd,\" He says, \"giveth His life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the Shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.\" The hireling does not here bear a good character, and yet in some respects is useful; nor would he be called an hireling, did he not receive hire from his employer. Who then is this hireling, that is both blameworthy and needful? And here, brethren, let the Lord Himself give us light, that we may know who the hirelings are, and be not hirelings ourselves. Who then is the hireling? There are some in office in the church, of whom the Apostle Paul saith, \"Who seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's.\" What means that, \"Who seek their own\"? Who do not love Christ freely, who do not seek after God for His own sake; who are pursuing after temporal advantages, gaping for gain, coveting honors from men. When such things are loved by an overseer, and for such things God is served, whoever such an one may be, he is an hireling who cannot count himself among the children. For of such also the Lord saith: \"Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward.\"[fn-19-P1986_1232452:10-nf] Listen to what the Apostle Paul says of St. Timothy: \"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your circumstances; for I have no man like-minded, who will naturally[fn-19-P1987_1232706:11-nf] care for you. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.\"[fn-19-P1988_1232816:12-nf] The shepherd mourned in the midst of hirelings. He sought some one who sincerely loved the flock of Christ, and round about him, amongst those who were with him at that time, he found not one. Not that there was no one then in the Church of Christ but the Apostle Paul and Timothy, who had a brother's[fn-19-P1989_1233140:13-nf] concern for the flock; but it so happened at the time of his sending Timothy, that he had none else of his sons about him; only hirelings were with him, \"who sought their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.\" And yet he himself, with a brother's anxiety for the flock, preferred sending his son, and remaining himself amongst hirelings. Hirelings are also found among ourselves, but the Lord alone distinguisheth them. He that searcheth the heart, distinguisheth them; and yet sometimes we know them ourselves. For it was not without a purpose that the Lord Himself said also of the wolves: \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"[fn-19-P1990_1233809:14-nf] Temptations put many to the question, and then their thoughts are made manifest; but many remain undiscovered. The Lord's fold must have as overseers, both those who are children and those who are hirelings. But the overseers, who are sons, are the shepherds. If they are shepherds, how is there but one Shepherd, save that all of them are members of the one Shepherd, to whom the sheep belong?

But see what answer the Lord gave to their dull apprehension. He saw that they could not bear the brilliance of the truth, and He tempered it with words. \"Is it not written in your law,\" that is, as given to you, \"that I said, Ye are gods?\"[fn-20-P2085_1289372:17-nf] And the Lord called all the Scriptures generally, the law: although elsewhere He speaks more definitely of the law, distinguishing it from the prophets; as it is said, \"The law and the prophets were until John;\"[fn-20-P2086_1289604:18-nf] and \"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-20-P2087_1289690:19-nf] Sometimes, however, He divided the same Scriptures into three parts, as where He saith, \"All things must be fulfilled which were written in the law, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.\"[fn-20-P2088_1289911:20-nf] But now He includes the psalms also under the name of the law, where it is written, \"I said, Ye are gods. If He calleth them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken: say ye of Him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world. Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?\" If the word of God came to men, that they might be called gods, how can the very Word of God, who is with God, be otherwise than God? If by the word of God men become gods, if by fellowship they become gods, can He by whom they have fellowship not be God? If lights which are lit are gods,is the light which enlighteneth not God? If throughbeing warmed in a way by saving fire they are constituted gods, is He who gives them the warmth other than God? Thou approachest the light and art enlightened, and numbered among the sons of God; if thou withdrawest from the light, thou fallest into obscurity, and art accounted in darkness; but that light approacheth not, because it never recedeth from itself. If, then, the word of God maketh you gods, how can the Word of God be otherwise than God? Therefore did the Father sanctify His Son, and send Him into the world. Perhaps some one may be saying: If the Father sanctified Him, was there then a time when He was not sanctified? He sanctified in the same way as He begat Him. For in the act of begetting He gave Him the power to be holy, because He begat Him in holiness.

But it becomes us rather to inquire what is to be understood by this serving of Christ to which there is attached so great a reward. For if we have taken up the idea that the serving of Christ is the preparation of what is needful for the body, or the cooking and serving up of food, or the mixing of drink and handing the cup to one at the supper table; this, indeed, was done to Him by those who had the privilege of His bodily presence, as in the case of Martha and Mary, when Lazarus also was one of those who sat at the table. But in that sort of way Christ was served also by the reprobate Judas; for it was he also who had the money bag; and although he had the exceeding wickedness to steal of its contents, yet it was he also who provided what was needful for the meal.[fn-22-P2245_1377494:16-nf] And so also, when our Lord said to him, \"What thou doest, do quickly,\" there were some who thought that He only gave him orders to make some needful preparations for the feast-day, or to give something to the poor.[fn-22-P2246_1378033:17-nf] In no sense, therefore, was it of this class of servants that the Lord said, \"Where I am, there shall also my servant be,\" and \"If any man serve me, him will my Father honor;\" for we see that Judas, who served in this way, became an object of reprobation rather than of honor. Why, then, go elsewhere to find out what this serving of Christ implies, and not rather see its disclosure in the words themselves? for when He said, \"If any man serve me, let him follow me,\" He wished it to be understood just as if He had said, If any man doth not follow me, he serveth me not. And those, therefore, are the servants of Jesus Christ, who seek not their own things, but the things that are Jesus Christ's.[fn-22-P2247_1378759:18-nf] For \"let him follow me\" is just this: Let him walk in my ways, and not in his own; as it is written elsewhere, \"He that saith he abideth in Christ, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\"[fn-22-P2248_1378978:19-nf] For he ought, if supplying food to the hungry, to do it in the way of mercy and not of boasting, seeking therein nothing else but the doing of good, and not letting his left hand know what his right hand doeth;[fn-22-P2249_1379209:20-nf] in other words, that all thought of self-seeking should be utterly estranged from a work of charity. He that serveth in this way serveth Christ, and will have it rightly said to him, \"Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of those who are mine, ye did it unto me.\"[fn-22-P2250_1379498:21-nf] And thus doing not only those acts of mercy that pertain to the body, but every good work, for the sake of Christ (for then will all be good, because \"Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth \"[fn-22-P2251_1379747:22-nf] ), he is Christ's servant even to that work of special love, which is to lay down his life for the brethren, for that were to lay it down also for Christ. For this also will He say hereafter in behalf of His members: Inasmuch as ye did it for these, ye have done it for me. And certainly it was in reference to such a work that He was also pleased to make and to style Himself a servant, when He says, \"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto [served], but to minister [serve], and to lay down His life for many.\"[fn-22-P2252_1380292:23-nf] Every one, therefore, is the servant of Christ in the same way as Christ also is a servant.

But apart from this moral understanding of the passage, we remember that the way in which we commended to your attention the grandeur of this act of the Lord's, was that, in washing the feet of disciples who were already washed and clean, the Lord instituted a sign, to the end that, on account of the human feelings that occupy us on earth, however far we may have advanced in our apprehension of righteousness, we might know that we are not exempt from sin; which He thereafter washes away by interceding for us, when we pray the Father, who is in heaven, to forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.[fn-24-P2479_1478744:10-nf] What connection, then, can such an understanding of the passage have with that which He afterwards gave Himself, when He explained the reason of His act in the words, \"If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you\"? Can we say that even a brother may cleanse a brother from the contracted stain of wrongdoing? Yea, verily, we know that of this also we were admonished in the profound significance of this work of the Lord's, that we should confess our faults one to another, and pray for one another, even as Christ also maketh intercession for us.[fn-24-P2480_1479437:11-nf] Let us listen to the Apostle James, who states this precept with the greatest clearness when he says, \"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another.\"[fn-24-P2481_1479623:12-nf] For of this also the Lord gave us the example. For if He who neither has, nor had, nor will have any sin, prays for our sins, how much more ought we to pray for one another's in turn! And if He forgives us, whom we have nothing to forgive; how much more ought we, who are unable to live here without sin, to forgive one another! For what else does the Lord apparently intimate in the profound significance of this sacramental sign, when He says, \"For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you;\" but what the apostle declares in the plainest terms, \"Forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye\"?[fn-24-P2482_1480322:13-nf] Let us therefore forgive one another his faults, and pray for one another's faults, and thus in a manner be washing one another's feet.

But these advantages must be retained with persistent care, lest our efforts fall away into idleness, and the devil's malice steal what God's grace gave. Since, therefore, by our forty days' observance[fn-38-P3837_970696:3-nf] we have wished to bring about this effect, that we should feel something of the Cross at the time of the Lord's Passion, we must strive to be found partakers also of Christ's Resurrection, and \"pass from death unto life[fn-38-P3838_971248:4-nf] ,\" while we are in this body. For when a man is changed by some process from one thing into another, not to be what he was is to him an ending, and to be what he was not is a beginning. But the question is, to what a man either dies or lives: because there is a death, which is the cause of living, and there is a life, which is the cause of dying. And nowhere else but in this transitory world are both sought after, so that upon the character of our temporal actions depend the differences of the eternal retributions. We must die, therefore, to the devil and live to God: we must perish to iniquity that we may rise to righteousness.Let the old sink, that the new may rise; and since, as says the Truth, \"no one can serve two masters[fn-38-P3839_972011:5-nf] ,\" let not him be Lord who has caused the overthrow of those that stood, but Him Who has raised the fallen to victory.","title":"Sermon LXXI.

For a favourable view of the character and life of St. Antony, see Neale's history[fn-42-P4241_1243789:16-nf] of this period; but, if he turns it into an indirect plea for the subsequent history of monasticism, we shall find in Canon Kingsley's Hypatia a high-wrought testimony of an antagonistic character. Bingham,[fn-42-P4242_1244084:17-nf] avoiding the entanglements of primitive with mediaeval history, affords a just view of what may be said of the rise of this mighty institution, based upon two texts[fn-42-P4243_1244281:18-nf] of Holy Scripture, proceeding from the Incarnate Word Himself, which impressed themselves on the fervid spirit of Antony. Who can wonder that fire and sword and ravening wolves predisposed men and women to avoid the domestic life, and the bringing of hapless families into existence as a prey to the remorseless cruelty of the empire? Far be it from me to forget what the world owes, directly and indirectly, to the nobler and purer orders,-what learning must ever acknowledge as its debt to the Benedictines of the West.[fn-42-P4244_1244840:19-nf] But, on the other hand, after the melancholy episcopate of Cyril, we cannot but trace, in the history of Oriental monasticism, not only the causes of the decay of Alexandrian scholarship and influence, but of the ignominious fate of the Byzantine Empire, and of that paltry devotion to images which seemed to invoke the retributions of a \"jealous god,\" and which favoured the rise of an impostor who found in his \"abhorrence of idols\" an excuse for making himself the \"Scourge of God.\"","title":"Translator's Introductory Notice.","author":"Peter, Bishop of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_63_homily_xix_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"ANF-08","text":"\"Do you maintain that there is any prince of evil or not?[fn-54-P5445_1593911:2-nf] For if you say that there is not, I can prove to you from many statements, and those too of your teacher, that there is; but if you honestly allow that the evil one exists, then I shall speak in accordance with this belief.\" And Peter said: \"It is impossible for me to deny the assertion of my Teacher.

The works, then, are doubtless those miracles of healing in connection with their bodily complaints which He exhibited to such an extent as no one before had furnished amongst them: for these they saw, and it is in reproaching them therewith that He proceeds to say, \"But now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father: but [this cometh to pass] that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause [gratuitously].\" He calls it, their law, not as invented by them, but given to them: just as we say, \"Our daily bread;\" which, nevertheless, we ask of God in conjoining the words \"Give us.\"[fn-30-P3089_1737443:22-nf] But one hates gratuitously who neither seeks advantage from the hatred nor avoids inconvenience: so do the wicked hate the Lord; and so also is He loved by the righteous, that is to say, gratuitously [gratis, freely,] inasmuch as they expect no other gifts beyond Himself, for He Himself will be all in all. But whoever would be disposed to look for something more profound in the words of Christ, \"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did\" (for although such were done by the Father, or the Holy Spirit, yet no one else did them, for the whole Trinity is one and the same in substance), he will find that it was He who did it even when some man of God did something similar. For in Himself He can do everything by Himself; but without Him no one can do anything. For Christ with the Father and the Holy Spirit are not three Gods, but one God, of whom it is written, \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.\"[fn-30-P3090_1738423:23-nf] No one else, therefore, really himself did the works which He did amongst them; for any one else who did any such works, did them only through His doing.
