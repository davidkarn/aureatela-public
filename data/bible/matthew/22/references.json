For we ought to be sure if there are any whose notice it escapes through ignorance of this world's literature, that there are among the Romans even gods of entrances; Cardea (Hinge-goddess), called after hinges, and Forculus (Door-god) after doors, and Limentinus (Threshold-god) after the threshold, and Janus himself (Gate-god) after the gate: and of course we know that, though names be empty and reigned, yet, when they are drawn down into superstition, demons and every unclean spirit seize them for themselves, through the bond of consecration. Otherwise demons have no name individually, but they there find a name where they find also a token. Among the Greeks likewise we read of Apollo Thyrµus, i.e. of the door, and the Antelii, or Anthelii, demons, as presiders over entrances. These things, therefore, the Holy Spirit foreseeing from the beginning, fore-chanted, through the most ancient prophet Enoch, that even entrances would come into superstitious use. For we see too that other entrances[fn-7-P771_318261:118-nf] are adored in the baths. But if there are beings which are adored in entrances, it is to them that both the lamps and the laurels will pertain. To an idol you will have done whatever you shall have done to an entrance. In this place I call a witness on the authority also of God; because it is not safe to suppress whatever may have been shown to one, of course for the sake of all. I know that a brother was severely chastised, the same night, through a vision, because on the sudden announcement of public rejoicings his servants had wreathed his gates. And yet himself had not wreathed, or commanded them to be wreathed; for he had gone forth from home before, and on his return had reprehended the deed. So strictly are we appraised with God in matters of this kind, even with regard to the discipline of our family.[fn-7-P772_319381:119-nf] Therefore, as to what relates to the honours due to kings or emperors, we have a prescript sufficient, that it behoves us to be in all obedience, according to the apostle's precept,[fn-7-P773_319704:120-nf] \"subject to magistrates, and princes, and powers; \"[fn-7-P774_319802:121-nf] but within the limits of discipline, so long as we keep ourselves separate from idolatry. For it is for this reason, too, that that example of the three brethren has forerun us, who, in other respects obedient toward king Nebuchodonosor rejected with all constancy the honour to his image,[fn-7-P775_320112:122-nf] proving that whatever is extolled beyond the measure of human honour, unto the resemblance of divine sublimity, is idolatry. So too, Daniel, in all other points submissive to Darius, remained in his duty so long as it was free from danger to his religion;[fn-7-P776_320385:123-nf] for, to avoid undergoing that danger, he feared the royal lions no more than they the royal fires. Let, therefore, them who have no light, light their lamps daily; let them over whom the fires of hell are imminent, affix to their posts, laurels doomed presently to burn: to them the testimonies of darkness and the omens of their penalties are suitable. You are a light of the world,[fn-7-P777_320785:124-nf] and a tree ever green.[fn-7-P778_320842:125-nf] If you have renounced temples, make not your own gate a temple. I have said too little. If you have renounced stews, clothe not your own house with the appearance of a new brothel.","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_06_of_the_morals_of_the_catholic_church_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"13.

This laurel one is sacred to Apollo or Bacchus-to the former as the god of archery, to the latter as the god of triumphs. In like manner Claudius teaches; when he tells us that soldiers are wont too to be wreathed in myrtle. For the myrtle belongs to Venus, the mother of the ¦neadµ, the mistress also of the god of war, who, through Ilia and the Romuli is Roman. But I do not believe that Venus is Roman as well as Mars, because of the vexation the concubine gave her.[fn-11-P1100_455555:44-nf] When military service again is crowned with olive, the idolatry has respect to Minerva, who is equally the goddess of arms-but got a crown of the tree referred to, because of the peace she made with Neptune. In these respects, the superstition of the military garland will be everywhere defiled and all-defiling. And it is further defiled, I should think, also in the grounds of it. Lo the yearly public pronouncing of vows, what does that bear on its face to be? It takes place first in the part of the camp where the general's tent is, and then in the temples. In addition to the places, observe the words also: \"We vow that you, O Jupiter, will then have an ox with gold-decorated horns.\" What does the utterance mean? Without a doubt the denial (of Christ). Albeit the Christian says nothing in these places with the mouth, he makes his response by having the crown on his head. The laurel is likewise commanded (to be used) at the distribution of the largess. So you see idolatry is not without its gain, selling, as it does, Christ for pieces of gold, as Judas did for pieces of silver. Will it be \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon\"[fn-11-P1101_456710:45-nf] to devote your energies to mammon, and to depart from God? Will it be \"Render unto Cµsar the things which are Cµsar's, and unto God the things which are God's,\"[fn-11-P1102_456890:46-nf] not only not to render the human being to God, but even to take the denarius from Cµsar?

For when he had said, on account of the love of God with which he was specially inflamed, \"If I have found grace in thy sight, show me now Thyself plainly, that I may find grace in Thy sight;\" he immediately subjoined, on account of the love also of his neighbor, \"And that I may know that this nation is Thy people.\" It is therefore that \"appearance\" which hurries away every rational soul with the desire of it, and the more ardently the more pure that soul is; and it is the more pure the more it rises to spiritual things; and it rises the more to spiritual things the more it dies to carnal things.

The first only requires judgment, and we share it with many; the second calls for toil, and few compete with us in it. \"He that shall endure unto the end,\" the Lord says, \"the same shall be saved,\"[fn-7-P788_158537:508-nf] and \"many are called but few are chosen.\"[fn-7-P789_158602:509-nf] Therefore I conjure you before God and Jesus Christ and His elect angels to guard that which you have received, not readily exposing to the public gaze the vessels of the Lord's temple (which only the priests are by right allowed to see), that no profane person may look upon God's sanctuary. Uzzah, when he touched the ark which it was not lawful to touch, was struck down suddenly by death.[fn-7-P790_159032:510-nf] And assuredly no gold or silver vessel was ever so dear to God as is the temple of a virgin's body. The shadow went before, but now the reality is come. You indeed may speak in all simplicity, and from motives of amiability may treat with courtesy the veriest strangers, but unchaste eyes see nothing aright. They fail to appreciate the beauty of the soul, and only value that of the body. Hezekiah showed God's treasure to the Assyrians,[fn-7-P791_159506:511-nf] who ought never to have seen what they were sure to covet. The consequence was that Judaea was torn by continual wars, and that the very first things carried away to Babylon were these vessels of the Lord. We find Belshazzar at his feast and among his concubines (vice always glories in defiling what is noble) drinking out of these sacred cups.[fn-7-P792_159891:512-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":22,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"868","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

In the next place there follows, \"Thy kingdom come.\" Just as the Lord Himself teaches in the Gospel that the day of judgment will take place at the very time when the gospel shall have been preached among all nations:[fn-6-P659_246688:41-nf] a thing which belongs to the hallowing of God's name. For here also the expression \"Thy kingdom come\" is not used in such a way as if God were not now reigning. But some one perhaps might say the expression \"come\" meant upon earth; as if, indeed, He were not even now really reigning upon earth, and had not always reigned upon it from the foundation of the world. \"Come,\" therefore, is to be understood in the sense of \"manifested to men.\" For in the same way also as a light which is present is absent to the blind, and to those who shut their eyes; so the kingdom of God, though it never departs from the earth, is yet absent to those who are ignorant of it. But no one will be allowed to be ignorant of the kingdom of God, when His Only-begotten shall come from heaven, not only in a way to be apprehended by the understanding, but also visibly in the person of the Divine Man, in order to judge the quick and the dead. And after that; judgment, i.e. when the process of distinguishing and separating the righteous from the unrighteous has taken place, God will so dwell in the righteous, that there will be no need for any one being taught by man, but all will be, as it is written, \"taught of God.\"[fn-6-P660_247914:42-nf] Then will the blessed life in all its parts be perfected in the saints unto eternity, just as now the most holy and blessed heavenly angels are wise and blessed, from the fact that God alone is their light; because the Lord hath promised this also to His own: \"In the resurrection,\" says He, \"they will be as the angels in heaven.\"[fn-6-P661_248278:43-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":49,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"21.

Then, further, when our Lord is found to have made certain statements which many who were present did not accept, but either resisted or despised, He is not to be thought to have given that which is holy to the dogs, or to have cast pearls before swine: for He did not give such things to those who were not able to receive them, but to those who were able, and were at the same time present; whom it was not meet that He should neglect on account of the impurity of others. And when tempters put questions to Him, and He answered them, so that they might have nothing to gainsay, although they might pine away from the effects of their own poisons, rather than be filled with His food, yet others, who were able to receive His teaching, heard to their profit many things in consequence of the opportunity created by these parties. I have said this, lest any one, perhaps, when he is not able to reply to one who puts a question to him, should seem to himself excused, if he should say that he is unwilling to give that which is holy to the dogs, or to cast pearls before swine. For he who knows what to answer ought to do it, even for the sake of others, in whose minds despair arises, if they believe that the question proposed cannot be answered: and this in reference to matters that are useful, and that belong to saving instruction. For many things which may be the subject of inquiry on the part of idle people are needless and vain, and often hurtful, respecting which, however, something must be said; but this very point is to be opened up and explained, viz. why such things ought not to form the subject of inquiry. In reference, therefore, to things that are useful, we ought sometimes to give a reply to what is asked of us: just as the Lord did, when the Sadducees had asked Him about the woman who had seven husbands, to which of them she would belong in the resurrection. For He answered that in the resurrection they will neither marry, nor be given in marriage, but will be as the angels in heaven. But sometimes, he who asks is to be asked something else, by telling which he would answer himself as to the matter he asked about; but if he should refuse to make a statement, it would not seem to those who are present unfair, if he himself should not hear anything as to the matter he inquired about. For those who put the question, tempting Him, whether tribute was to be paid, were asked another question, viz. whose image the money bore which was brought forward by themselves; and because they told what they had been asked, i.e. that the money bore the image of Caesar, they gave a kind of answer to themselves in reference to the question they had asked the Lord: and accordingly from their answer He drew this inference, \"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\"[fn-9-P900_346612:204-nf] When, however, the chief priests and elders of the people had asked by what authority He was doing those things, He asked them about the baptism of John: and when they would not make a statement which they saw to be against themselves, and yet would not venture to say anything bad about John, on account of the bystanders, \"Neither tell I you,\" says He, \"by what authority I do these things;\"[fn-9-P901_347032:205-nf] a refusal which appeared most just to the bystanders. For they said they were ignorant of that which they really knew, but did not wish to tell. And, in truth, it was right that they who wished to have an answer to what they asked, should themselves first do what they required to be done toward them; and if they had done this, they would certainly have answered themselves. For they themselves had sent to John, asking who he was; or rather they themselves, being priests and Levites, had been sent, supposing that he was the very Christ, but he said that he was not, and gave forth a testimony concerning the Lord:[fn-9-P902_347676:206-nf] a testimony respecting which if they chose to make a confession, they would teach themselves by what authority as the Christ He was doing those things; which as if ignorant of they had asked, in order that they might find an avenue for calumny.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"75. Moreover, this precept seems to refer to the love of our neighbour, and not to the love of God also, seeing that in another passage He says that there are two precepts on which \"hang all the law and the prophets.\" For if He had said, All things whatsoever ye would should be done to you, do ye even so; in this one sentence He would have embraced both those precepts: for it would soon be said that every one wishes that he himself should be loved both by God and by men; and so, when this precept was given to him, that what he wished done to himself he should himself do, that certainly would be equivalent to the precept that he should love God and men. But when it is said more expressly of men, \"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,\" nothing else seems to be meant than, \"Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-9-P917_355607:212-nf] But we must carefully attend to what He has added here: \"for this is the law and the prophets.\" Now, in the case of these two precepts, He not merely says, The law and the prophets hang; but He has also added, \"all the law and the prophets,\"[fn-9-P918_356558:213-nf] which is the same as the whole of prophecy: and in not making the same addition here, He has kept a place for the other precept, which refers to the love of God. Here, then, inasmuch as He is following out the precepts with respect to a single heart, and it is to be dreaded test any one should have a double heart toward those from whom the heart can be hid, i.e. toward men, a precept with respect to that very thing was to be given. For there is almost nobody that would wish that any one of double heart should have dealings with himself.

But we are blessed from Him, and through Him, and in Him; because we ourselves are one by His gift, and one spirit with Him, because our soul cleaves to Him so as to follow Him. And it is good for us to cleave to God, since He will destroy every man who is estranged from Him.[fn-11-P1133_466015:12-nf] Therefore the Ho!y Spirit, whatever it is, is something common both to the Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and co-eternal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so called; but it is more aptly called love. And this is also a substance, since God is a substance, and \"God is love,\" as it is written.[fn-11-P1134_466381:13-nf] But as He is a substance together with the Father and the Son, so that substance is together with them great, and together with them good, and together with them holy, and whatsoever else is said in reference to substance; since it is not one thing to God to be, and another to be great or to be good. and the rest, as we have shown above. For if love is less great therein [i.e. in God] than wisdom, then wisdom is loved in less degree than according to what it is; love is therefore equal, in order that wisdom may be loved according to its being; but wisdom is equal with the Father, as we have proved above; therefore also the Holy Spirit is equal; and if equal, equal in all things, off account of the absolute simplicity which is in that substance.

At such a time angels stand by the Priest; and the whole sanctuary, and the space round about the altar, is filled with the powers of heaven, in honor of Him who lieth thereon. For this, indeed, is capable of being proved from the very rites which are being then celebrated. I myself, moreover, have heard some one once relate, that a certain aged, venerable man, accustomed to see revelations, used to tell him, that he being thought worthy of a vision of this kind, at such a time, saw, on a sudden, so far as was possible for him, a multitude of angels, clothed in shining robes, and encircling the altar, and bending down, as one might see soldiers in the presence of their King, and for my part I believe it. Moreover another told me, without learning it from some one else, but as being himself thought worthy to be both an ear and eye witness of it, that, in the case of those who are about to depart hence, if they happen to be partakers of the mysteries, with a pure conscience, when they are about to breathe their last, angels keep guard over them for the sake of what they have received, and bear them hence. And dost thou not yet tremble to introduce a soul into so sacred a mystery of this kind, and to advance to the dignity of the Priesthood, one robed in filthy raiment, whom Christ has shut out from the rest of the band of guests?[fn-5-P560_292225:8-nf] The soul of the Priest should shine like a light beaming over the whole world.

For the Priest ought not only to be thus pure as one who has been dignified with so high a ministry, but very discreet, and skilled in many matters, and to be as well versed in the affairs of this life as they who are engaged in the world, and yet to be free from them all more than the recluses who occupy the mountains. For since he must mix with men who have wives, and who bring up children, who possess servants, and are surrounded with wealth, and fill public positions, and are persons of influence, he too should be a many-sided man-I say many-sided, not unreal, nor yet fawning and hypocritical, but full of much freedom and assurance, and knowing how to adapt himself profitably, where the circumstances of the case require it, and to be both kind and severe, for it is not possible to treat all those under one's charge on one plan, since neither is it well for physicians to apply one course of treatment to all their sick, nor for a pilot to know but one way of contending with the winds. For, indeed, continual storms beset this ship of ours, and these storms do not assail from without only, but take their rise from within, and there is need of much condescension, and circumspection, and all these different matters have one end in view, the glory of God, and the edifying of the Church.","title":"Book VI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":22,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_08_lecture_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2.

But this, too, is because be who loves his neighbor must needs also love above all else love itself.

But (will she say), \"In peace? \"In that case, she must necessarily persevere in that (peace) with him whom she will no longer have the power to divorce; not that she would, even if she had been able to divorce him, have been marriageable. Indeed, she prays for his soul, and requests refreshment for him meanwhile, and fellowship (with him) in the first resurrection; and she offers (her sacrifice) on the anniversaries of his falling asleep. For, unless she does these deeds, she has in the true sense divorced him, so far as in her lies; and indeed the more iniquitously-inasmuch as (she did it) as far as was in her power-because she had no power (to do it); and with the more indignity, inasmuch as it is with more indignity if (her reason for doing it is) because he did not deserve it. Or else shall we, pray, cease to be after death, according to (the teaching of) some Epicurus, and not according to (that of) Christ? But if we believe the resurrection of the dead, of course we shall be bound to them with whom we are destined to rise, to render an account the one of the other. \"But if 'in that age they will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be equal to angels,'[fn-11-P1190_315918:82-nf] is not the fact that there will be no restitution of the conjugal relation a reason why we shall not be bound to our departed consorts? \"Nay, but the more shall we be bound (to them), because we are destined to a better estate-destined (as we are) to rise to a spiritual consortship, to recognise as well our own selves as them who are ours.

But you will say: \"If everybody were a virgin, what would become of the human race\"? Like shall here beget like. If everyone were a widow, or continent in marriage, how will mortal men be propagated? Upon this principle there will be nothing at all for fear that something else may cease to exist. To put a case: if all men were philosophers, there would be no husbandmen. Why speak of husbandmen? there would be no orators, no lawyers, no teachers of the other professions. If all men were leaders, what would become of the soldiers? If all were the head, whose head would they be called, when there were no other members? You are afraid that if the desire for virginity were general there would be no prostitutes, no adulteresses, no wailing infants in town or country. Every day the blood of adulterers[fn-64-P6418_1981425:250-nf] is shed, adulterers are condemned, and lust is raging and rampant in the very presence of the laws and the symbols of authority and the courts of justice. Be not afraid that all will become virgins: virginity is a hard matter, and therefore rare, because it is hard: \"Many are called, few chosen.\" Many begin, few persevere. And so the reward is great for those who have persevered. If all were able to be virgins, our Lord would never have said:[fn-64-P6419_1981995:251-nf] \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it:\" and the Apostle would not have hesitated to give his advice,-[fn-64-P6420_1982135:252-nf] \"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord.\" Why then, you will say, were the organs of generation created, and why were we so fashioned by the all-wise creator, that we burn for one another, and long for natural intercourse? To reply is to endanger our modesty: we are, as it were, between two rocks, the[fn-64-P6421_1982479:253-nf] Symplegades of necessity and virtue, on either side; and must make shipwreck of either our sense of shame, or of the cause we defend: If we reply to your suggestions, shame covers our face. If shame secures silence, in a manner we seem to desert our post, and to leave the ground clear to the raging foe. Yet it is better, as the story goes, to shut our eyes and fight like the[fn-64-P6422_1983067:254-nf] blindfold gladiators, than not to repel with the shield of truth the darts aimed at us. I can indeed say: \"Our hinder parts which are banished from sight, and the lower portions of the abdomen, which perform the functions of nature, are the Creator's work.\" But inasmuch as the physical conformation of the organs of generation testifies to difference of sex, I shall briefly reply: Are we never then to forego lust, for fear that we may have members of this kind for nothing? Why then should a husband keep himself from his wife? Why should a widow persevere in chastity, if we were only born to live like beasts? Or what harm does it do me if another man lies with my wife? For as the teeth were made for chewing, and the food masticated passes into the stomach, and a man is not blamed for giving my wife bread: similarly if it was intended that the organs of generation should always be performing their office, when my vigour is spent let another take my place, and, if I may so speak, let my wife quench her burning lust where she can. But what does the Apostle mean by exhorting to continence, if continence be contrary to nature? What does our Lord mean when He instructs us in the various kinds of eunuchs.[fn-64-P6423_1984301:255-nf] Surely[fn-64-P6424_1984330:256-nf] the Apostle who bids us emulate his own chastity, must be asked, if we are to be consistent, Why are you like other men, Paul? Why are you distinguished from the female sex by a beard, hair, and other peculiarities of person? How is it that you have not swelling bosoms, and are not broad at the hips, narrow at the chest? Your voice is rugged, your speech rough, your eyebrows more shaggy. To no purpose you have all these manly qualities, if you forego the embraces of women. I am compelled to say something and become a fool: but you have forced me to dare to speak. Our Lord and Saviour,[fn-64-P6425_1984945:257-nf] Who though He was in the form of God, condescended to take the form of a servant, and became obedient to the Father even unto death, yea the death of the cross-what necessity was there for Him to be born with members which He was not going to use? He certainly was circumcised to manifest His sex. Why did he cause John the Apostle and John the Baptist to make themselves eunuchs through love of Him, after causing them to be born men? Let us then who believe in Christ follow His example. And if we knew Him after the flesh, let us no longer know Him according to the flesh. The substance of our resurrection bodies will certainly be the same as now, though of higher glory. For the Saviour after His descent into hell had so far the selfsame body in which He was crucified, that[fn-64-P6426_1985748:258-nf] He showed the disciples the marks of the nails in His hands and the wound in His side. Moreover, if we deny the identity of His body because[fn-64-P6427_1985912:259-nf] He entered though the doors were shut, and this is not a property of human bodies, we must deny also that Peter and the Lord had real bodies because they[fn-64-P6428_1986089:260-nf] walked upon the water, which is contrary to nature.[fn-64-P6429_1986166:261-nf] \"In the resurrection of the dead they will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like the angels.\" What others will hereafter be in heaven, that virgins begin to be on earth. If likeness to the angels is promised us (and there is no difference of sex among the angels), we shall either be of no sex as are the angels, or at all events which is clearly proved, though we rise from the dead in our own sex, we shall not perform the functions of sex.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_16_book_x","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"This being so, if the Platonists, or those who think with them, knowing God, glorified Him as God and gave thanks, if they did not become vain in their own thoughts, if they did not originate or yield to the popular errors, they would certainly acknowledge that neither could the blessed immortals retain, nor we miserable mortals reach, a happy condition without worshipping the one God of gods, who is both theirs and ours. To Him we owe the service which is called in Greek latreia, whether we render it outwardly orinwardly; for we are all His temple, each of us severally and all of us together, because He condescends to inhabit each individually and the whole harmonious body, being no greater in all than in each, since He is neither expanded nor divided. Our heart when it rises to Him is His altar; the priest who intercedes for us is His Only-begotten; we sacrifice to Him bleeding victims when we contend for His truth even unto blood; to Him we offer the sweetest incense when we come before Him burning with holy and pious love; to Him we devote and surrender ourselves and His gifts in us; to Him, by solemn feasts and on appointed days, we consecrate the memory of His benefits, lest through the lapse of time ungrateful oblivion should steal upon us; to Him we offer on the altar of our heart the sacrifice of humility and praise, kindled by the fire of burning love. It is that we may see Him, so far as He can be seen; it is that we may cleave to Him, that we are cleansed from all stain of sins and evil passions, and are consecrated in His name. For He is the fountain of our happiness, He the end of all our desires. Being attached to Him, or rather let me say, re-attached,-for we had detached ourselves and lost hold of Him,-being, I say, re-attached to Him,[fn-16-P1607_908955:10-nf] we tend towards Him by love, that we may rest in Him, and find our blessedness by attaining that end, For our good, about which philosophers have so keenly contended, is nothing else than to be united to God. It is, if I may say sod by spiritually embracing Him that the intellectual soul is filled and impregnated with true virtues. We are enjoined to love this good with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our strength. To this good we ought to be led by those who love us, and to lead those we love. Thus are fulfilled those two commandments on which hang all the law and the prophets: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy soul;\" and\" Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"[fn-16-P1608_909855:11-nf] For, that man might be intelligent in his self-love, there was appointed for him an end to which he might refer all his actions, that he might be blessed. For he who loves himself wishes nothing else than this. And the end set before him is \"to draw near to God.\"[fn-16-P1609_910144:12-nf] And so, when one who has this intelligent self-love is commanded to love his neighbor as himself, what else is enjoined than that he shall do all in his power to commend to him the love of God? This is the worship of God, this is true religion, this right piety, this the service due to God only. If any immortal power, then, no matter with what virtue endowed, loves us as himself, he must desire that we find our happiness by submitting ourselves to Him, in submission to whom he himself finds happiness. If he does not worship God, he is wretched, because deprived of God; if he worships God, he cannot wish to be worshipped in God's stead. On the contrary, these higher powers acquiesce heartily in the divine sentence in which it is written, \"He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.\"[fn-16-P1610_911005:13-nf] ","title":"Book X","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_16_book_x","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"And who is so foolish as to suppose that the things offered to God are needed by Him for some uses of His own? Divine Scripture in many places explodes this idea. Not to be wearisome, suffice it to quote this brief saying from a psalm: \"I have said to the Lord, Thou art my God: for Thou needest not my goodness.\"[fn-16-P1617_912254:14-nf] We must believe, then, that God has no need, not only of cattle, or any other earthly and material thing, but even of man's righteousness, and that whatever right worship is paid to God profits not Him, but man. For no man would say he did a benefit to a fountain by drinking, or to the light by seeing. And the fact that the ancient church offered animal sacrifices, which the people of God now-a-days read of without imitating, proves nothing else than this, that those sacrifices signified the things which we do for the purpose of drawing near to God, and inducing our neighbor to do the same. A sacrifice, therefore, is the visible sacrament or sacred sign of an invisible sacrifice. Hence that penitent in the psalm, or it may be the Psalmist himself, entreating God to be merciful to his sins, says, \"If Thou desiredst sacrifice, I would give it: Thou delightest not in whole burnt-offerings. The sacrifice of God is a broken heart: a heart contrite and humble God will not despise.\"[fn-16-P1618_913263:15-nf] Observe how, in the very words in which he is expressing God's refusal of sacrifice, he shows that God requires sacrifice. He does not desire the sacrifice of a slaughtered beast, but He desires the sacrifice of a contrite heart. Thus, that sacrifice which he says God does not wish, is the symbol of the sacrifice which God does wish. God does not wish sacrifices in the sense in which foolish people think He wishes them, viz., to gratify His own pleasure. For if He had not wished that the sacrifices He requires, as, e.g., a heart Contrite and humbled by penitent sorrow, should be symbolized by those sacrifices which He was thought to desire because pleasant to Himself, the old law would never have enjoined their presentation; and they were destined to be merged when the fit opportunity arrived, in order that men might not suppose that the sacrifices themselves, rather than the things symbolized by them, were pleasing to God or acceptable in us. Hence, in another passage from another psalm, he says, \"If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is mine and the fullness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?\"[fn-16-P1619_914448:16-nf] as if He should say, Supposing such things were necessary to me, I would never ask thee for what I have in my own hand. Then he goes on to mention what these signify: \"Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me.\"[fn-16-P1620_914803:17-nf] So in another prophet: \"Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the High God? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? Hath He showed thee, 0 man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\"[fn-16-P1621_915333:18-nf] In the words of this prophet, these two things are distinguished and set forth with sufficient explicitness, that God does not require these sacrifices for their own sakes, and that He does require the sacrifices which they symbolize. In the epistle entitled \"To the Hebrews\" it is said, \"To do good and to communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\"[fn-16-P1622_915735:19-nf] And. so, when it is written,\" I desire mercy rather than sacrifice,\"[fn-16-P1623_915825:20-nf] nothing else is meant than that one sacrifice is preferred to another; for that which in common speech is called sacrifice is only the symbol of the true sacrifice. Now mercy is the true sacrifice, and therefore it is said, as I have just quoted, \"with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\" All the divine ordinances, therefore, which we read concerning the sacrifices in the service of the tabernacle or the temple, we are to refer to the love of God and our neighbor.

When, therefore, it thinks itself to be something of this kind, it thinks itself to be a corporeal thing; and since it is perfectly conscious of its own superiority, by which it rules the body, it has hence come to pass that the question has been raised what part of the body has the greater power in the body; and the opinion has been held that this is the mind, nay, that it is even the whole soul altogether. And some accordingly think it to be the blood, others the brain, others the heart; not as the Scripture says, \"I will praise Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart;\" and, \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart;\"[fn-14-P1407_656073:2-nf] for this word by misapplication or metaphor is transferred from the body to the soul; but they have simply thought it to be that small part itself of the body, which we see when the inward parts are rent asunder. Others, again, have believed the soul to be made up of very minute and individual corpustules, which they call atoms, meeting in themselves and cohering. Others have said that its substance is air, others fire. Others have been of opinion that it is no substance at all, since they could not think any substance unless it is body, and they did not find that the soul was body; but it was in their opinion the tempering together itself of our body, or the combining together of the elements, by which-that flesh is as it were conjoined. And hence all of these have held the soul to be mortal; since, whether it were body, or some combination of body, certainly it could not in either case continue always without death. But they who have held its substance to be some kind of life the reverse of corporeal, since they have found it to be a life that animates and quickens every living body, have by consequence striven also, according as each was able, to prove it immortal, since life cannot be without life.","title":"Book X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":34,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For why should God, the founder of the universe, the Governor of the whole world,[fn-20-P2045_697669:14-nf] the Fashioner of humanity, the Sower[fn-20-P2046_697718:15-nf] of universal nations be believed to have given a law through Moses to one people, and not be said to have assigned it to all nations?

Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God. Melchizedek also, \"the priest of the most high God,\" uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was chosen to the priesthood of God.[fn-20-P2065_704730:34-nf] Lot, withal, the brother[fn-20-P2066_704771:35-nf] of Abraham, proves that it was for the merits of righteousness, without observance of the law, that he was freed from the conflagration of the Sodomites.[fn-20-P2067_704969:36-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_10_homily_ii_the_earth_was_invisible_and_unfinished_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"6. And the Spirit of God was borne upon the face of the waters.[fn-20-P2089_608367:22-nf] Does this spirit mean the diffusion of air? The sacred writer wishes to enumerate to you the elements of the world, to tell you that God created the heavens, the earth, water, and air and that the last was now diffused and in motion; or rather, that which is truer and confirmed by the authority of the ancients, by the Spirit of God, he means the Holy Spirit. It is, as has been remarked, the special name, the name above all others that Scripture delights to give to the Holy Spirit. and always by the spirit of God the Holy Spirit is meant, the Spirit which completes the divine and blessed Trinity. You will find it better therefore to take it in this sense. How then did the Spirit of God move upon the waters? The explanation that I am about to give you is not an original one, but that of a Syrian,[fn-20-P2090_609198:23-nf] who was as ignorant in the wisdom of this world as he was versed in the knowledge of the Truth. He said, then, that the Syriac word was more expressive, and that being more analogous to the Hebrew term it was a nearer approach to the scriptural sense. This is the meaning of the word; by \"was borne\" the Syrians, he says, understand: it cherished[fn-20-P2091_609568:24-nf] the nature of the waters as one sees a bird cover the eggs with her body and impart to them vital force from her own warmth. Such is, as nearly as possible, the meaning of these words-the Spirit was borne: let us understand, that is, prepared the nature of water to produce living beings:[fn-20-P2092_609986:25-nf] a sufficient proof for those who ask if the Holy Spirit took an active part in the creation of the world.7. And God said, Let there be light.[fn-20-P2093_610962:26-nf] The first word of God created the nature of light; it made darkness vanish, dispelled gloom, illuminated the world, and gave to all beings at the same time a sweet and gracious aspect. The heavens, until then enveloped in darkness, appeared with that beauty which they still present to our eyes. The air was lighted up, or rather made the light circulatemixed with its substance, and, distributing itssplendour rapidly in every direction, so dispersed itself to its extreme limits. Up it sprang to the very aether and heaven. In an instant it lighted up the whole extent of the world, the North and the South, the East and the West. For the aether also is such a subtle substance and so transparent that it needs not the space of a moment for light to pass through it. Just as it carries our sight instantaneously to the object of vision,[fn-20-P2094_611876:27-nf] so without the least interval, with a rapidity I that thought cannot conceive, it receives these rays of light in its uttermost limits. With light the aether becomes more pleasing and the waters more limpid. These last, not content with receiving its splendour, return it by the reflection of light and in all directions send forth quivering flashes. The divine word gives every object a more cheerful and a more attractive appearance, just as when men in deep sea pour in oil they make the place about them clear. So, with a single word and in one instant, the Creator of all things gave the boon of light to the world.[fn-20-P2095_612513:28-nf] ","title":"Homily II.-\"The Earth Was Invisible and Unfinished.\"","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":22,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Now we must proceed, in the case of the prodigal son, to consider first that which is more useful; for no adjustment of examples, albeit in the most nicely-poised balance, shall be admitted if it shall prove to be most hurtful to salvation. But the whole system of salvation, as it is comprised in the maintenance of discipline, we see is being subverted by that interpretation which is affected by the opposite side. For if it is a Christian who, after wandering far from his Father, squanders, by living heathenishly, the \"substance\" received from God his Father,-(the substance), of course, of baptism-(the substance), of course, of the Holy Spirit, and (in consequence) of eternal hope; if, stripped of his mental \"goods,\" he has even handed his service over to the prince of the world[fn-14-P1416_398528:103-nf] -who else but the devil?-and by him being appointed over the business of \"feeding swine\"-of tending unclean spirits, to wit-has recovered his senses so as to return to his Father,-the result will be, that, not adulterers and fornicators, but idolaters, and blasphemers, and renegades, and every class of apostates, will by this parable make satisfaction to the Father; and in this way (it may) rather (be said that) the whole \"substance\" of the sacrament is most truly wasted away. For who will fear to squander what he has the power of afterwards recovering? Who will be careful to preserve to perpetuity what he will be able to lose not to perpetuity? Security in sin is likewise an appetite for it. Therefore the apostate withal will recover his former \"garment,\" the robe of the Holy Spirit; and a renewal of the \"ring,\" the sign and seal of baptism; and Christ will again be \"slaughtered; \"[fn-14-P1417_399474:104-nf] and he will recline on that couch from which such as are unworthily clad are wont to be lifted by the torturers, and cast away into darkness,[fn-14-P1418_399701:105-nf] -much more such as have been stripped. It is therefore a further step if it is not expedient, (any more than reasonable), that the story of the prodigal son should apply to a Christian. Wherefore, if the image of a \"son\" is not entirely suitable to a Jew either, our interpretation shall be simply governed with an eye to the object the Lord had in view. The Lord had come, of course, to save that which \"had perished; \"[fn-14-P1419_400152:106-nf] \"a Physician.\" necessary to \"the sick\" \"more than to the whole.\"[fn-14-P1420_400245:107-nf] This fact He was in the habit both of typifying in parables and preaching in direct statements. Who among men \"perishes,\" who falls from health, but he who knows not the Lord? Who is \"safe and sound,\" but he who knows the Lord? These two classes-\"brothers\" by birth-this parable also will signify. See whether the heathen have in God the Father the \"substance\" of origin, and wisdom, and natural power of Godward recognition; by means of which power the apostle withal notes that \"in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom knew not God,\"[fn-14-P1421_400834:108-nf] -(wisdom) which, of course, it had received originally from God. This (\"substance\"), accordingly, he \"squandered; \"having been cast by his moral habits far from the Lord, amid the errors and allurements and appetites of the world,[fn-14-P1422_401086:109-nf] where, compelled by hunger after truth,[fn-14-P1423_401142:110-nf] he handed himself over to the prince of this age. He set him over \"swine,\" to feed that flock familiar to demons,[fn-14-P1424_401278:111-nf] where he would not be master of a supply of vital food, and at the same time would see others (engaged) in a divine work, having abundance of heavenly bread. He remembers his Father, God; he returns to Him when he has been satisfied; he receives again the pristine \"garment,\"-the condition, to wit, which Adam by transgression had lost. The \"ring\" also he is then Wont to receive for the first time, wherewith, after being interrogated,[fn-14-P1425_401779:112-nf] he publicly seals the agreement of faith, and thus thenceforward feeds upon the \"fatness\" of the Lord's body,-the Eucharist, to wit. This will be the prodigal son, who never in days bygone was thrifty; who was from the first prodigal, because not from the first a Christian. Him withal, returning from the world to the Father's embraces, the Pharisees mourned over, in the persons of the \"publicans and sinners.\" And accordingly to this point alone the elder brother's envy is adapted: not because the Jews were innocent, and obedient to God, but because they envied the nation salvation; being plainly they who ought to have been \"ever with\" the Father. And of course it is immediately over the first calling of the Christian that the Jew groans, not over his second restoration: for the former reflects its rap even upon the heathen; but the latter, which takes place in the churches, is not known even to the Jews. I think that I have advanced interpretations more consonant with the subject-matter of the parables, and the congruity of things, and the preservation of disciplines. But if the view with which the opposite party is eager to mould the ewe, and the drachma, and the voluptuousness of the son to the shape of the Christian sinner, is that they may endow adultery and fornication with (the gift of) repentance; it will be fitting either that all other crimes equally capital should be conceded remissible, or else that their peers, adultery and fornication, should be retained inconcessible.","title":"VII.

Perhaps we can rightly call vision the end and rest of the will, only with respect tO this one object [namely, the bodily thing that is visible]. For it will not will nothing else merely because it sees something which it is now willing. It is not therefore the whole will itself of the man, of which the end is nothing else than blessedness; but the will provisionally directed to this one object, which has as its end in seeing, nothing but vision, whether it refer the thing seen to any other thing or not. For if it does not refer the vision to anything further, but wills only to see this, there can be no question made about showing that the end of the will is the vision; for it is manifest. But if it does refer it to anything further, then certainly it does will something else, and it will not be now a will merely to see; or if to see, not one to see the particular thing. Just as, if any one wished to see the scar, that from thence he might learn that there had been a wound; or wished to see the window, that through the window he might see the passers-by: all these and other such acts of will have their own proper [proximate] ends, which are referred to that [final] end of the will by which we will to live blessedly, and to attain to that life which is not referred to anything else, but suffices of itself to him who loves it. The will then to see, has as its end vision; and the will to see this particular thing, has as its end the vision of this particular thing. Therefore the will to see the scar, desires its own end, that is, the vision of the scar, and does not reach beyond it; for the will to prove that there had been a wound, is a distinct will, although dependent upon that, of which the end also is to prove that there had been a wound. And the will to see the window, has as its end the vision of the window; for that is another and further will which depends upon it, viz. to see the passers-by through the window, of which also the end is the vision of the passers-by. But all the several wills that are bound to each other, are a once right, if that one is good, to which all are referred; and if that is bad, then all are bad. And so the connected series of right wills is a sort of road which consists as it were of certain steps, whereby to ascend to blessedness; but the entanglement of depraved and distorted wills is a bond by which he will be bound who thus acts, so as to be cast into outer darkness.[fn-14-P1469_711565:10-nf] Blessed therefore are they who in act and character sing the song of the steps [degrees];[fn-14-P1470_711676:11-nf] and woe to those that draw sin, as it were a long rope.[fn-14-P1471_711765:12-nf] And it is just the same to speak of the will being in repose, which we call its end, if it is still referred to something further, as if we should say that the foot is at rest in walking, when it is placed there, whence yet another foot may be planted in the direction of the man's steps. But if something so satisfies, that the will acquiesces in it with a certain delight; it is nevertheless not yet that to which the man ultimately tends; but this too is referred to something further, so as to be regarded not as the native country of a citizen, but as a place of refreshment, or even of stopping, for a traveller.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":40,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_21_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_smyrnaeans","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Let no man deceive himself.

If I wished to prove the resurrection of the flesh and of all the members, and to give the meaning of the several passages, many books would be, required; but the matter in hand does not call for this. For I purposed not to reply to Origen in every detail, but to disclose the mysteries of your insincere \"Apology.\" I have, however, tarried long in maintaining the opposite to your position, and am afraid that, in my eagerness to expose fraud, I may leave a stumbling-block in the way of the reader. I will, therefore, mass together the evidence, and glance at the proofs in passing, so that we may bring all the weight of Scripture to bear upon your poisonous argument. He who has not a wedding garment, and has not kept that command,[fn-71-P7114_2349669:81-nf] \"Let your garments be always white,\" is bound hand and foot that he may not recline at the banquet, or sit on a throne, or stand at the right hand of God;[fn-71-P7115_2349841:82-nf] he is sent to Gehenna, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.[fn-71-P7116_2349931:83-nf] \"The hairs of your head are numbered.\" If the hairs, I suppose the teeth would be more easily numbered. But there is no object in numbering them if they are some day to perish.[fn-71-P7117_2350126:84-nf] \"The hour will come in which all who are in the tombs shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and shall come forth.\" They shall hear with ears, come forth with feet. This Lazarus had already done. They shall, moreover, come forth from the tombs; that is, they who had been laid in the tombs, the dead, shall come, and shall rise again from their graves. For the dew which God gives is[fn-71-P7118_2350528:85-nf] healing to their bones. Then shall be fulfilled what God says by the prophet,[fn-71-P7119_2350669:86-nf] \"Go, my people, into thy closets for a little while, until mine anger pass.\" The closets signify the graves, out of which that, of course, is brought forth which had been laid therein. And they shall come out of the graves like young mules free from the halter. Their heart shall rejoice, and their bones shall rise like the sun; all flesh shall come into the presence of the Lord, and He shall command the fishes of the sea; and they shall give up the bones which they had eaten; and He shall bring joint to joint, and bone to bone; and[fn-71-P7120_2351226:87-nf] they who slept in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to life eternal, others to shame and everlasting confusion. Then shall the just see the punishment and tortures of the wicked, for[fn-71-P7121_2351432:88-nf] their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be extinguished, and they shall be beheld by all flesh. As many of us, therefore, as have this hope, as we have yielded our members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity, so let us yield them servants to righteousness unto holiness, that[fn-71-P7122_2351757:89-nf] we may rise from the dead and walk in newness of life. As also the life of the Lord Jesus is manifested in our mortal body. so[fn-71-P7123_2351901:90-nf] also He who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead shall quicken our mortal bodies on account of His Spirit Who dwelleth in us. For it is right that as we have always borne about the putting to death of Christ in our body, so the life, also, of Jesus, should be manifested in our mortal body, that is, in our flesh, which is mortal according to nature, but eternal according to grace. Stephen also[fn-71-P7124_2352317:91-nf] saw Jesus standing on the right hand of the Father, and the[fn-71-P7125_2352396:92-nf] hand of Moses became snowy white, and was afterwards restored to its original colour. There was still a hand, though the two states were different. The potter in[fn-71-P7126_2352574:93-nf] Jeremiah, whose vessel, which he had made, was broken through the roughness of the stone, restored from the same lump and from the same clay that which had fallen to pieces; and, if we look at the word resurrection itself, it does not mean that one thing is destroyed, another raised up; and the addition of the word dead, points to our own flesh, for that which in man dies, that is also brought to life.[fn-71-P7127_2353011:94-nf] The wounded man on the road to Jericho is taken to the inn with all his limbs complete, and the stripes of his offences are healed with immortality.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":22,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"XI. \"The next question which must be put,\" he says, \"is, in how many ways all sin is manifested?

Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.\"[fn-25-P2515_1012868:59-nf] In other words, let us, as many as are running perfectly, be thus resolved, that, being not yet perfected, we pursue our course to perfection along the way by which we have thus far run perfectly, in order that \"when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part may be done away; \"[fn-25-P2516_1013186:60-nf] that is, may cease to be but in part any longer, but become whole and complete. For to faith and hope shall succeed at once the very substance itself, no longer to be believed in and hoped for, but to be seen and grasped. Love, however, which is the greatest among the three, is not to be superseded, but increased and fulfilled,-contemplating in full vision what it used to see by faith, and acquiring in actual fruition what it once only embraced in hope. Then in all this plenitude of charity will be fulfilled the commandment, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\"[fn-25-P2517_1013842:61-nf] For while there remains any remnant of the lust of the flesh, to be kept in check by the rein of continence, God is by no means loved with all one's soul. For the flesh does not lust without the soul; although it is the flesh which is said to lust, because the soul lusts carnally. In that perfect state the just man shall live absolutely without any sin, since there will be in his members no law warring against the law of his mind,[fn-25-P2518_1014401:62-nf] but wholly will he love God, with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his mind[fn-25-P2519_1014510:63-nf] which is the first and chief commandment. For why should not such perfection be enjoined on man, although in this life nobody may attain to it? For we do not rightly run if we do not know whither we are to run. But how could it be known, unless it were pointed out in precepts?[fn-25-P2520_1014809:64-nf] Let us therefore \"so run that we may obtain.\"[fn-25-P2521_1014911:65-nf] For all who run rightly will obtain,-not as in the contest of the theatre, where all indeed run, but only one wins the prize.[fn-25-P2522_1015057:66-nf] Let us run, believing, hoping, longing; let us run, subjugating the body, cheerfully and heartily doing alms,-in giving kindnesses and forgiving injuries, praying that our strength may be helped as we run; and let us so listen to the commandments which urge us to perfection, as not to neglect running towards the fulness of love.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"141","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now the entire process of sowing, forming, and completing the human embryo in the womb is no doubt regulated by some power, which ministers herein to the will of God, whatever may be the method which it is appointed to employ. Even the superstition of Rome, by carefully attending to these points, imagined the goddess Alemona to nourish the f£tus in the womb; as well as (the goddesses) Nona and Decima, called after the most critical months of gestation; and Partula, to manage and direct parturition; and Lucina, to bring the child to the birth and light of day. We, on our part, believe the angels to officiate herein for God. The embryo therefore becomes a human being in the womb from the moment that its form is completed. The law of Moses, indeed, punishes with due penalties the man who shall cause abortion, inasmuch as there exists already the rudiment of a human being,[fn-29-P2935_1031173:256-nf] which has imputed to it even now the condition of life and death, since it is already liable to the issues of both, although, by living still in the mother, it for the most part shares its own state with the mother. I must also say something about the period of the soul's birth, that I may omit nothing incidental in the whole process. A mature and regular birth takes place, as a general rule, at the commencement of the tenth month. They who theorize respecting numbers, honour the number ten as the parent of all the others, and as imparting perfection to the human nativity. For my own part, I prefer viewing this measure of time in reference to God, as if implying that the ten months rather initiated man into the ten commandments; so that the numerical estimate of the time needed to consummate our natural birth should correspond to the numerical classification of the rules of our regenerate life. But inasmuch as birth is also completed with the seventh month, I more readily recognize in this number than in the eighth the honour of a numerical agreement with the sabbatical period; so that the month in which God's image is sometimes produced in a human birth, shall in its number tally with the day on which God's creation was completed and hallowed. Human nativity has sometimes been allowed to be premature, and yet to occur in fit and perfect accordance with an hebdomad sevenfold number, as an auspice of our resurrection, and rest, and kingdom. The ogdoad, or eightfold number, therefore, is not concerned in our formation;[fn-29-P2936_1032739:257-nf] for in the time it represents there will be no more marriage.[fn-29-P2937_1032896:258-nf] We have already demonstrated the conjunction of the body and the soul, from the concretion of their very seminations to the complete formation of the f£tus. We now maintain their conjunction likewise from the birth onwards; in the first place, because they both grow together, only each in a different manner suited to the diversity of their nature-the flesh in magnitude, the soul in intelligence-the flesh in material condition, the soul in sensibility. We are, however, forbidden to suppose that the soul increases in substance, lest it should be said also to be capable of diminution in substance, and so its extinction even should be believed to be possible; but its inherent power, in which are contained all its natural peculiarities, as originally implanted in its being, is gradually developed along with the flesh, without impairing the germinal basis of the substance, which it received when breathed at first into man. Take a certain quantity of gold or of silver-a rough mass as yet: it has indeed a compact condition, and one that is more compressed at the moment than it will be; yet it contains within its contour what is throughout a mass of gold or of silver. When this mass is afterwards extended by beating it into leaf, it becomes larger than it was before by the elongation of the original mass, but not by any addition thereto, because it is extended in space, not increased in bulk; although in a way it is even increased when it is extended: for it may be increased in form, but not in state. Then, again, the sheen of the gold or the silver, which when the metal was any in block was Inherent in it no doubt really, but yet only obscurely, shines out in developed lustre. Afterwards various modifications of shape accrue, according to the feasibility in the material which makes it yield to the manipulation of the artisan, who yet adds nothing to the condition of the mass but its configuration. In like manner, the growth and developments of the soul are to be estimated, not as enlarging its substance, but as calling forth Its powers.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-04","text":"12. So far, my brother, as the question proposed by you is concerned, you have our opinion in answer and encouragement. But he who inquires whether persecution ought to be shunned by us must now be prepared to consider the following question also: Whether, if we should not flee from it, we should at least buy ourselves off from it. Going further than you expected, therefore, I will also on this point give you my advice, distinctly affirming that persecution, from which it is evident we must not flee, must in like manner not even be bought off. The difference lies in the payment; but as flight is a buying off without money, so buying off is money-flight. Assuredly you have here too the counselling of fear. Because you fear, you buy yourself off; and so you flee. As regards your feet, you have stood; in respect of the money you have paid, you have run away. Why, in this very standing of yours there was a fleeing from persecution, in the release from persecution which you bought; but that you should ransom with money a man whom Christ has ransomed with His blood, how unworthy is it of God and His ways of acting, who spared not His own Son for you, that He might be made a curse for us, because cursed is he that hangeth on a tree,[fn-19-P1990_603475:47-nf] -Him who was led as a sheep to be a sacrifice, and just as a lamb before its shearer, so opened He not His mouth;[fn-19-P1991_603623:48-nf] but gave His back to the scourges, nay, His cheeks to the hands of the smiter, and turned not away His face from spitting, and, being numbered with the transgressors, was delivered up to death, nay, the death of the cross. All this took place that He might redeem us from our sins. The sun ceded to us the day of our redemption; hell re-transferred the right it had in us, and our covenant is in heaven; the everlasting gates were lifted up, that the King of Glory, the Lord of might, might enter in,[fn-19-P1992_604143:49-nf] after having redeemed man from earth, nay, from hell, that he might attain to heaven. What, now, are we to think of the man who strives against that glorious One, nay, slights and defiles His goods, obtained at so great a ransom-no less, in truth, than His most precious blood? It appears, then, that it is better to flee than to fall in value, if a man will not lay out for himself as much as he cost Christ. And the Lord indeed ransomed him from the angelic powers which rule the world-from the spirits of wickedness, from the darkness of this life, from eternal judgment, from everlasting death. But you bargain for him with an informer, or a soldier or some paltry thief of a ruler-under, as they say, the folds of the tunic-as if he were stolen goods whom Christ purchased in the face of the whole world, yes, and set at liberty. Will you value, then, this free man at any price, and possess him at any price, but the one, as we have said, it cost the Lord,-namely, His own blood? (And if not,) why then do you purchase Christ in the man in whom He dwells, as though He were some human property? No otherwise did Simon even try to do, when he offered the apostles money for the Spirit of Christ. Therefore this man also, who in buying himself has bought the Spirit of Christ, will hear that word, \"Your money perish with you, since you have thought that the grace of God is to be had at a price!\"[fn-19-P1993_605563:50-nf] Yet who will despise him for being (what he is), a denier? For what says that extorter? Give me money: assuredly that he may not deliver him up, since he tries to sell you nothing else than that which he is going to give you for money. When you put that into his hands, it is certainly your wish not to be delivered up. But not delivered up, had you to be held up to public ridicule? While, then, in being unwilling to be delivered up, you are not willing to be thus exposed; by this unwillingness of yours you have denied that you are what you have been unwilling to have it made public that you are. Nay, you say, While I am unwilling to be held up to the public as being what I am, I have acknowledged that I am what I am unwilling to be so held up as being, that is, a Christian. Can Christ, therefore, claim that you, as a witness for Him, have stedfastly shown Him forth? He who buys himself off does nothing in that way. Before one it might, I doubt not, be said, You have confessed Him; so also, on the account of your unwillingness to confess Him before many you have denied Him. A man's very safety will pronounce that he has fallen while getting out of persecution's way. He has fallen, therefore, whose desire has been to escape. The refusal of martyrdom is denial. A Christian is preserved by his wealth, and for this end has his treasures, that he may not suffer, while he will be rich toward God. But it is the case that Christ was rich in blood for him. Blessed therefore are the poor, because, He says, the kingdom of heaven is theirs who have the soul only treasured up.[fn-19-P1994_607173:51-nf] If we cannot serve God and mammon, can we be redeemed both by God and by mammon? For who will serve mammon more than the man whom mammon has ransomed? Finally, of what example do you avail yourself to warrant your averting by money the giving of you up? When did the apostles, dealing with the matter, in any time of persecution trouble, extricate themselves by money? And money they certainly had from the prices of lands which were laid down at their feet,[fn-19-P1995_607649:52-nf] there being, without a doubt, many of the rich among those who believed-men, and also women, who were wont, too, to minister to their comfort. When did Onesimus, or Aquila, or Stephen,[fn-19-P1996_607856:53-nf] give them aid of this kind when they were persecuted? Paul indeed, when Felix the governor hoped that he should receive money for him from the disciples,[fn-19-P1997_608052:54-nf] about which matter he also dealt with the apostle in private, certainly neither paid it himself, nor did the disciples for him. Those disciples, at any rate. who wept because he was equally persistent in his determination to go to Jerusalem, and neglectful of all means to secure himself from the persecutions which had been foretold as about to occur there, at last say, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was that will? No doubt that he should suffer for the name of the Lord, not that he should be bought off. For as Christ laid down His life for us, so, too, we should do for Him; and not only for the Lord Himself, nay, but likewise for our brethren on His account. This, too, is the teaching of John when he declares, not that we should pay for our brethren, but rather that we should die for them. It makes no difference whether the thing not to be done by you is to buy off a Christian, or to buy one. And so the will of God accords with this. Look at the condition-certainly of God's ordaining, in whose hand the king's heart is-of kingdoms and empires. For increasing the treasury there are daily provided so many appliances-registerings of property, taxes in kind benevolences, taxes in money; but never up to this time has ought of the kind been provided by bringing Christians under some purchase-money for the person and the sect, although enormous gains could be reaped from numbers too great for any to be ignorant of them. Bought with blood, paid for with blood, we owe no money for our head, because Christ is our Head. It is not fit that Christ should cost us money. How could martyrdoms, too, take place to the glory of the Lord, if by tribute we should pay for the liberty of our sect? And so he who stipulates to have it at a price, opposes the divine appointment. Since, therefore, Caesar has imposed nothing on us after this fashion of a tributary sect-in fact, such an imposition never can be made,-with Antichrist now close at hand, and gaping for the blood, not for the money of Christians-how can it be pointed out to me that there is the command, \"Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's? \"[fn-19-P1998_610207:55-nf] A soldier, be he an informer or an enemy, extorts money from me by threats, exacting nothing on Caesar's behalf; nay, doing the very opposite, when for a bribe he lets me go-Christian as I am, and by the laws of man a criminal. Of another sort is the denarius which I owe to Caesar, a thing belonging to him, about which the question then was started, it being a tribute coin due indeed by those subject to tribute, not by children. Or how shall I render to God the things which are God's,-certainly, therefore, His own likeness and money inscribed with His name, that is, a Christian man? But what do I owe God, as I do Caesar the denarius, but the blood which His own Son shed for me? Now if I owe God, indeed, a human being and my own blood; but I am now in this juncture, that a demand is made upon me for the payment of that debt, I am undoubtedly guilty of cheating God if I do my best to withhold payment. I have well kept the commandment, if, rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, I refuse to God the things which are God's!","title":"IX.

But how shall we assemble together? say you; how shall we observe the ordinances of the Lord? To be sure, just as the apostles also did, who were protected by faith, not by money; which faith, if it can remove a mountain, can much more remove a soldier. Be your safeguard wisdom, not a bribe. For you will not have at once complete security from the people also, should you buy off the interference of the soldiers. Therefore all you need for your protection is to have both faith and wisdom: if you do not make use of these, you may lose even the deliverance which you have purchased for yourself; while, if you do employ them, you can have no need of any ransoming. Lastly, if you cannot assemble by day, you have the night, the light of Christ luminous against its darkness. You cannot run about among them one after another. Be content with a church of threes. It is better that you sometimes should not see your crowds, than subject yourselves (to a tribute bondage). Keep pure for Christ His betrothed virgin; let no one make gain of her. These things, my brother, seem to you perhaps harsh and not to be endured; but recall that God has said, \"He who receives it, let him receive it,\"[fn-20-P2003_615769:58-nf] that is, let him who does not receive it go his way.

Lastly, Simon Magus also, when he offered the apostles money, does not say, \"Give me also this power, that I may give\" the Holy Spirit; but, \"that on whomsoever I may lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.\" Because neither had the Scriptures said before, And Simon, seeing that the apostles gave the Holy Spirit; but it had said,\" And Simon, seeing that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of the apostles' hands.\"[fn-21-P2125_1074760:122-nf] Therefore also the Lord Jesus Christ Himself not only gave the Holy Spirit as God, but also received it as man, and therefore He is said to be full of grace,[fn-21-P2126_1074944:123-nf] and of the Holy Spirit.[fn-21-P2127_1074987:124-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles it is more plainly written of Him, \"Because God anointed Him With the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-21-P2128_1075133:125-nf] Certainly not with visible oil but with the gift of grace which is signified by the visible ointment wherewith the Church anoints the baptized. And Christ was certainly not then anointed with the Holy Spirit, when He, as a dove, descended upon Him at His baptism.[fn-21-P2129_1075416:126-nf] For at that time He deigned to prefigure His body, i.e. His Church, in which especially the baptized receive the Holy Spirit. But He is to be understood to have been then anointed with that mystical and invisible unction, when the Word of God was made flesh,[fn-21-P2130_1075697:127-nf] i.e. when human nature, without any precedent merits of good works, was joined to God the Word in the womb of the Virgin, so that with it it became one person. Therefore it is that we confess Him to have been born of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary. For it is most absurd to believe Him to have received the Holy Spirit when He was near thirty years old: for at that age He was baptized by John;[fn-21-P2131_1076118:128-nf] but that He came to baptism as without any sin at all, so not without the Holy Spirit. For if it was written of His servant and forerunner John himself, \"He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb,\"[fn-21-P2132_1076367:129-nf] because, although generated by his father, yet he received the Holy Spirit when formed in the womb; what must be understood and believed of the man Christ, of whose flesh the very conception was not carnal, but spiritual? Both natures, too, as well the human as the divine, are shown in that also that is written of Him, that He received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and shed forth the Holy Spirit:[fn-21-P2133_1076802:130-nf] seeing that He received as man, and shed forth as God. And we indeed can receive that gift according to our small measure, but assuredly we cannot shed it forth upon others; but, that this may be done, we invoke over them God, by whom this is accomplished.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_111_discourse_ii_theophila_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-06","text":"And perhaps there will be room for some to argue plausibly among those who are wanting in discrimination and judgment, that this fleshly garment of the soul, being planted by men, is shaped spontaneously apart from the sentence of God. If, however, he should teach that the immortal being of the soul also is sown along with the mortal body, he will not be believed; for the Almighty alone breathes into man the undying and undecaying part, as also it is He alone who is Creator of the invisible and indestructible. For, He says, He \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\"[fn-49-P4941_1491140:13-nf] And those artificers who, to the destruction of men, make images in human form, not perceiving and knowing their own Maker, are blamed by the Word, which says, in the Book of Wisdom, a book full of all virtue,[fn-49-P4942_1491367:14-nf] \"his heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay; forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and Him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit; \"[fn-49-P4943_1491710:15-nf] that is, God, the Maker of all men; therefore, also, according to the apostle, He \"will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.\"[fn-49-P4944_1491893:16-nf] And now, although this subject be scarcely completed, yet there are others which remain to be discussed. For when one thoroughly examines and understands those things which happen to man according to his nature, he will know not to despise the procreation of children, although he applauds chastity, and prefers it in honour. For although honey be sweeter and more pleasant than other things, we are not for that reason to consider other things bitter which are mixed up in the natural sweetness of fruits. And, in support of these statements, I will bring forward a trustworthy witness, namely, Paul, who says, \"So then he that giveth her[fn-49-P4945_1492552:17-nf] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth bet ter.\"[fn-49-P4946_1492760:18-nf] Now the word, in setting forth that which is better and sweeter, did not intend to take away the inferior, but arranges so as to assign to each its own proper use and advantage. For there are some to whom it is not given to attain virginity; and there are others whom He no longer wills to be excited by procreations to lust, and to be defiled, but henceforth to meditate and to keep the mind upon the transformation of the body to the likeness of angels, when they \"neither marry nor are given in marriage,\"[fn-49-P4947_1493290:19-nf] according to the infallible words of the Lord; since it is not given to all to attain that undefiled state of being a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,[fn-49-P4948_1493475:20-nf] but manifestly to those only who are able to preserve the ever-blooming and unfading flower of virginity. For it is the custom of the prophetic Word to compare the Church to a flower covered and variegated meadow, adorned and crowned not only with the flowers of virginity, but also with those of child-bearing and of continence; for it is written, \"Upon thy[fn-49-P4949_1493854:21-nf] right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.\"[fn-49-P4950_1493966:22-nf] ","title":"Discourse II.-Theophila.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":22,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"161","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"106.

Now David was a man skilled in songs, who dearly loved musical harmony, not with a vulgar delight, but with a believing disposition, and by it served his God, who is the true God, by the mystical representation of a great thing. For the rational and well-ordered concord of diverse sounds in harmonious variety suggests the compact unity of the well-ordered city. Then almost all his prophecy is in psalms, of which a hundred and fifty are contained in what we call the Book of Psalms, of which some will have it those only were made by David which are inscribed with his name. But there are also some who think none of them were made by him except those which are marked \"Of David;\" but those which have in the title \"For David\" have been made by others who assumed his person. Which opinion is refuted by the voice of the Saviour Himself in the Gospel, when He says that David himself by the Spirit said Christ was his Lord; for the 110th Psalm begins thus, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-31-P3173_1747778:102-nf] And truly that very psalm, like many more, has in the title, not \"of David,\" but \"for David.\" But those seem to me to hold the more credible opinion, who ascribe to him the authorship of all these hundred and fifty psalms, and think that he prefixed to some of them the names even of other men, who prefigured something pertinent to the matter, but chose to have no man's name in the titles of the rest, just as God inspired him in the management of this variety, which, although dark, is not meaningless. Neither ought it to move one not to believe this that the names of some prophets who lived long after the times of king David are read in the inscriptions of certain psalms in that book, and that the things said there seem to be spoken as it were by them. Nor was the prophetic Spirit unable to reveal to king David, when he prophesied, even these names of future prophets, so that he might prophetically sing something which should suit their persons; just as it was revealed to a certain prophet that king Josiah should arise and reign after more than three hundred years, who predicted his future deeds also along with his name.[fn-31-P3174_1748960:103-nf] ","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":123,"source_paragraph":"380","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"All the commandments of God, then, are embraced in love, of which the apostle says: \"Now the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.\"[fn-27-P2788_1287431:236-nf] Thus the end of every commandment is charity, that is, every commandment has love for its aim.

For when Paul says, \"Now the Lord is the Spirit,\" he goes on to say, \"and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\" If then \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and \"Spirit\" means \"essence,\" what are we to understand by \"the essence of the essence\"? He speaks again of another Spirit of the Lord Who is the Spirit,-that is to say, according to your interpretation, of another essence. Therefore in your view the Apostle, when he writes expressly of \"the Lord the Spirit,\" and of \"the Spirit of the Lord,\" means nothing else than an essence of an essence. Well, let Eunomius make what he likes of that which is written; what we understand of the matter is as follows. The Scripture, \"given by inspiration of God,\" as the Apostle calls it, is the Scripture of the Holy Spirit, and its intention is the profit of men. For \"every scripture,\" he says, \"is given by inspiration of God and is profitable\"; and the profit is varied and multiform, as the Apostle says-\"for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness[fn-17-P1758_1014334:9-nf] .\" Such a boon as this, however, is not within any man's reach to lay hold of, but the Divine intention lies hid under the body of the Scripture, as it were under a veil, some legislative enactment or some historical narrative being cast over the truths that are contemplated by the mind. For this reason, then, the Apostle tells us that those who look upon the body of the Scripture have \"a veil upon their heart[fn-17-P1759_1014768:10-nf] ,\" and are not able to look upon the glory of the spiritual law, being hindered by the veil that has been cast over the face of the law-giver. Wherefore he says, \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,\" showing that often the obvious interpretation, if it be not taken according to the proper sense, has an effect contrary to that life which is indicated by the Spirit, seeing that this lays down for all men the perfection of virtue in freedom from passion, while the history contained in the writings sometimes embraces the exposition even of facts incongruous, and is understood, so to say, to concur with the passions of our nature, whereto if any one applies himself according to the obvious sense, he will make the Scripture a doctrine of death. Accordingly, he says that over the perceptive powers of the souls of men who handle what is written in too corporeal a manner, the veil is cast; but for those who turn their contemplation to that which is the object of the intelligence, there is revealed, bared, as it were, of a mask, the glory that underlies the letter. And that which is discovered by this more exalted perception he says is the Lord, which is the Spirit. For he says, \"when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be takenaway: now the Lord is the Spirit[fn-17-P1760_1016077:11-nf] .\" And in so saying he makes a distinction of contrast between the lordship of the spirit and the bondage of the letter; for as that which gives life is opposed to that which kills, so he contrasts \"the Lord\" with bondage. And that we may not be under any confusion when we are instructed concerning the Holy Spirit (being led by the word \"Lord\" to the thought of the Only-begotten), for this reason he guards the word by repetition, both saying that \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and making further mention of \"the Spirit of the Lord,\" that the supremacy of His Nature may be shown by the honour implied in lordship, while at the same time he may avoid confusing in his argument the individuality of His Person. For he who calls Him both \"Lord\" and \"Spirit of the Lord,\" teaches us to conceive of Him as a separate individual besides the Only-begotten; just as elsewhere he speaks of \"the Spirit of Christ[fn-17-P1761_1017017:12-nf] ,\" employing fairly and in its mystic sense this very term which is piously employed in the system of doctrine according to the Gospel tradition. Thus we, the \"most miserable of all men,\" being led onward by the Apostle in the mysteries, pass from the letter that killeth to the Spirit that giveth life, learning from Him Who was in Paradise initiated into the unspeakable mysteries, that all things the Divine Scripture says are utterances of the Holy Spirit. For \"well did the Holy Spirit prophesy[fn-17-P1762_1017536:13-nf] ,\"-this he says to the Jews in Rome, introducing the words of Isaiah; and to the Hebrews, alleging the authority of the Holy Spirit in the words, \"wherefore as saith the Holy Spirit[fn-17-P1763_1017744:14-nf] ,\" he adduces the words of the Psalm which are spoken at length in the person of God; and from the Lord Himself we learn the same thing,-that David declared the heavenly mysteries not \"in\" himself (that is, not speaking according to human nature). For how could any one, being but man, know the supercelestial converse of the Father with the Son? But being \"in the Spirit\" he said that the Lord spoke to the Lord those words which He has uttered. For if, He says, \"David in the Spirit calls him Lord, how is He then his son[fn-17-P1764_1018287:15-nf] ?\" Thus it is by the power of the Spirit that the holy men who are under Divine influence are inspired, and every Scripture is for this reason said to be \"given by inspiration of God,\" because it is the teaching of the Divine afflatus. If the bodily veil of the words were removed, that which remains is Lord and life and Spirit, according to the teaching of the great Paul, and according to the words of the Gospel also. For Paul declares that he who turns from the letter to the Spirit no longer apprehends the bondage that slays, but the Lord which is the life-giving Spirit; and the sublime Gospel says, \"the words that I speak are spirit and are life[fn-17-P1765_1018982:16-nf] ,\" as being divested of the bodily veil. The idea, however, that \"the Spirit\" is the essence of the Only-begotten, we shall leave to our dreamers: or rather, we shall make use, ex abundanti, of what they say, and arm the truth with the weapons of the adversary. For it is allowable that the Egyptian should be spoiled by the Israelites, and that we should make their wealth an ornament for ourselves. If the essence of the Son is called \"Spirit,\" and God also is Spirit, (for so the Gospel tells us[fn-17-P1766_1019506:17-nf] ), clearly the essence of the Father is called \"Spirit\" also. But if it is their peculiar argument that things which are introduced by different names are different also in nature, the conclusion surely is, that things which are named alike are not alien one from the other in nature either.

For if God is in the Gospel called \"Spirit,\" and the essence of the Only-begotten is maintained by Eunomius to be \"Spirit,\" as there is no apparent difference in the one name as compared with the other, neither, surely, will the things signified by the names be mutually different in nature.","title":"Book VII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":22,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_18_book_vii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Then how will you make it fit with what follows? For when Paul says, \"Now the Lord is the Spirit,\" he goes on to say, \"and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\" If then \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and \"Spirit\" means \"essence,\" what are we to understand by \"the essence of the essence\"? He speaks again of another Spirit of the Lord Who is the Spirit,-that is to say, according to your interpretation, of another essence. Therefore in your view the Apostle, when he writes expressly of \"the Lord the Spirit,\" and of \"the Spirit of the Lord,\" means nothing else than an essence of an essence. Well, let Eunomius make what he likes of that which is written; what we understand of the matter is as follows. The Scripture, \"given by inspiration of God,\" as the Apostle calls it, is the Scripture of the Holy Spirit, and its intention is the profit of men. For \"every scripture,\" he says, \"is given by inspiration of God and is profitable\"; and the profit is varied and multiform, as the Apostle says-\"for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness[fn-17-P1758_1014334:9-nf] .\" Such a boon as this, however, is not within any man's reach to lay hold of, but the Divine intention lies hid under the body of the Scripture, as it were under a veil, some legislative enactment or some historical narrative being cast over the truths that are contemplated by the mind. For this reason, then, the Apostle tells us that those who look upon the body of the Scripture have \"a veil upon their heart[fn-17-P1759_1014768:10-nf] ,\" and are not able to look upon the glory of the spiritual law, being hindered by the veil that has been cast over the face of the law-giver. Wherefore he says, \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,\" showing that often the obvious interpretation, if it be not taken according to the proper sense, has an effect contrary to that life which is indicated by the Spirit, seeing that this lays down for all men the perfection of virtue in freedom from passion, while the history contained in the writings sometimes embraces the exposition even of facts incongruous, and is understood, so to say, to concur with the passions of our nature, whereto if any one applies himself according to the obvious sense, he will make the Scripture a doctrine of death. Accordingly, he says that over the perceptive powers of the souls of men who handle what is written in too corporeal a manner, the veil is cast; but for those who turn their contemplation to that which is the object of the intelligence, there is revealed, bared, as it were, of a mask, the glory that underlies the letter. And that which is discovered by this more exalted perception he says is the Lord, which is the Spirit. For he says, \"when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be takenaway: now the Lord is the Spirit[fn-17-P1760_1016077:11-nf] .\" And in so saying he makes a distinction of contrast between the lordship of the spirit and the bondage of the letter; for as that which gives life is opposed to that which kills, so he contrasts \"the Lord\" with bondage. And that we may not be under any confusion when we are instructed concerning the Holy Spirit (being led by the word \"Lord\" to the thought of the Only-begotten), for this reason he guards the word by repetition, both saying that \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and making further mention of \"the Spirit of the Lord,\" that the supremacy of His Nature may be shown by the honour implied in lordship, while at the same time he may avoid confusing in his argument the individuality of His Person. For he who calls Him both \"Lord\" and \"Spirit of the Lord,\" teaches us to conceive of Him as a separate individual besides the Only-begotten; just as elsewhere he speaks of \"the Spirit of Christ[fn-17-P1761_1017017:12-nf] ,\" employing fairly and in its mystic sense this very term which is piously employed in the system of doctrine according to the Gospel tradition. Thus we, the \"most miserable of all men,\" being led onward by the Apostle in the mysteries, pass from the letter that killeth to the Spirit that giveth life, learning from Him Who was in Paradise initiated into the unspeakable mysteries, that all things the Divine Scripture says are utterances of the Holy Spirit. For \"well did the Holy Spirit prophesy[fn-17-P1762_1017536:13-nf] ,\"-this he says to the Jews in Rome, introducing the words of Isaiah; and to the Hebrews, alleging the authority of the Holy Spirit in the words, \"wherefore as saith the Holy Spirit[fn-17-P1763_1017744:14-nf] ,\" he adduces the words of the Psalm which are spoken at length in the person of God; and from the Lord Himself we learn the same thing,-that David declared the heavenly mysteries not \"in\" himself (that is, not speaking according to human nature). For how could any one, being but man, know the supercelestial converse of the Father with the Son? But being \"in the Spirit\" he said that the Lord spoke to the Lord those words which He has uttered. For if, He says, \"David in the Spirit calls him Lord, how is He then his son[fn-17-P1764_1018287:15-nf] ?\" Thus it is by the power of the Spirit that the holy men who are under Divine influence are inspired, and every Scripture is for this reason said to be \"given by inspiration of God,\" because it is the teaching of the Divine afflatus. If the bodily veil of the words were removed, that which remains is Lord and life and Spirit, according to the teaching of the great Paul, and according to the words of the Gospel also. For Paul declares that he who turns from the letter to the Spirit no longer apprehends the bondage that slays, but the Lord which is the life-giving Spirit; and the sublime Gospel says, \"the words that I speak are spirit and are life[fn-17-P1765_1018982:16-nf] ,\" as being divested of the bodily veil. The idea, however, that \"the Spirit\" is the essence of the Only-begotten, we shall leave to our dreamers: or rather, we shall make use, ex abundanti, of what they say, and arm the truth with the weapons of the adversary. For it is allowable that the Egyptian should be spoiled by the Israelites, and that we should make their wealth an ornament for ourselves. If the essence of the Son is called \"Spirit,\" and God also is Spirit, (for so the Gospel tells us[fn-17-P1766_1019506:17-nf] ), clearly the essence of the Father is called \"Spirit\" also. But if it is their peculiar argument that things which are introduced by different names are different also in nature, the conclusion surely is, that things which are named alike are not alien one from the other in nature either.

Thus the entire office of justice in this respect becomes an agency[fn-44-P4478_1446136:167-nf] for goodness: whatever it condemns by its judgment, whatever it chastises by its condemnation, whatever (to use your phrase) it ruthlessly pursues,[fn-44-P4479_1446303:168-nf] it, in fact, benefits with good instead of injuring. Indeed, the fear of judgment contributes to good, not to evil. For good, now contending with an enemy, was not strong enough to recommend itself[fn-44-P4480_1446516:169-nf] by itself alone. At all events, if it could do so much, it could not keep its ground; for it had lost its impregnability through the foe, unless some power of fear supervened, such as might compel the very unwilling to seek after good, and take care of it. But who, when so many incentives to evil were assailing him, would desire that good, which he could despise with impunity? Who, again, would take care of what he could lose without danger? You read bow broad is the road to evil,[fn-44-P4481_1447021:170-nf] how thronged in comparison with the opposite: would not all glide down that road were there nothing in it to fear? We dread the Creator's tremendous threats, and yet scarcely turn away from evil. What, if He threatened not? Will you call this justice an evil, when it is all unfavourable to evil? Will you deny it to be a good, when it has its eye towards[fn-44-P4482_1447400:171-nf] good? What sort of being ought you to wish God to be? Would it be right to prefer that He should be such, that sins might flourish under Him, and the devil make mock at Him? Would you suppose Him to be a good God, who should be able to make a man worse by security in sin? Who is the author of good, but He who also requires it? In like manner who is a stranger to evil, except Him who is its enemy? Who its enemy, besides Him who is its conqueror? Who else its conqueror, than He who is its punisher? Thus God is wholly good, because in all things He is on the side of good. In fact, He is omnipotent, because able both to help and to hurt. Merely to profit is a comparatively small matter, because it can do nothing else than a good turn. From such a conduct[fn-44-P4483_1448179:172-nf] with what confidence can I hope for good, if this is its only ability? How can I follow after the reward of innocence, if I have no regard to the requital of wrong-doing? I must needs have my doubts whether he might not fail in recompensing one or other alternative, who was unequal in his resources to meet both. Thus far, then, justice is the very fulness of the Deity Himself, manifesting God as both a perfect father and a perfect master: a father in His mercy, a master in His discipline; a father in the mildness of His power, a master in its severity; a father who must be loved with dutiful affection, a master who must needs be feared; be loved, because He prefers mercy to sacrifice;[fn-44-P4484_1448893:173-nf] be feared because He dislikes sin; be loved, because He prefers the sinner, s repentance to his death;[fn-44-P4485_1449015:174-nf] be feared, because He dislikes the sinners who do not repent. Accordingly, the divine law enjoins duties in respect of both these attributes: Thou shalt love God, and, Thou shalt fear God.

It is a silly falsehood that thou hast been seduced to another God, who promises abundance of food and the land of Canaan. For thou canst perceive how the saints of old, who were also thy children, were enlightened by these figures which were prophecies of thee. Thou needest not regard the poor jest against the stone tablets, for the stony heart of which they were in old times a figure is not in thee. For thou art an epistle of the apostles, \"written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on the fleshy tables of the heart.\"[fn-16-P1624_888759:10-nf] Our opponents ignorantly think that these words are in their favor, and that the apostle finds fault with the dispensation of the Old Testament, whereas they are the words of the prophet.

The prophet says: \"I will take away from them the stony heart, and I will give them a heart of flesh.\"[fn-16-P1625_889257:11-nf] What is this but \"Not on tables of stones but on the fleshy tables of the heart\"? For by the heart of flesh and the fleshy tables is not meant a carnal understanding: but as flesh feels, whereas a stone cannot, the insensibility of stone signifies an unintelligent heart, and the sensibility of flesh signifies an intelligent heart. Instead, then, of scoffing at thee, they deserve to be ridiculed who say that earth, and wood, and stones have sense, and that their life is more intelligent than animal life. So, not to speak of the truth, even their own fiction obliges them to confess that the law written on tables of stone was purer than their sacred parchments. Or perhaps they prefer sheepskin to stone, because their legends make stones the bones of princes. In any case, the ark of the Old Testament was a cleaner covering for the tables of stone than the goatskin of their manuscripts. Laugh at these things, while pitying them, to show their falsehood and absurdity. With a heart no longer stony, thou canst see in these stone tablets a suitableness to that hard-hearted people; and at the same time thou canst find even there the stone, thy Bridegroom, described by Peter as \"a living stone, rejected by men, but chosen of God, and precious.\" To them He was \"a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence;\" but to thee, \"the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner.\"[fn-16-P1626_890679:12-nf] This is all explained by Peter, and is quoted from the prophets, with whom these heretics have nothing to do. Fear not, then, to read these tablets-they are from thy Husband; to others the stone was a sign of insensibility, but to thee of strength and stability. With the finger of God these tablets were written; with the finger of God thy Lord cast out devils; with the finger of God drive thou away the doctrines of lying devils which sear the conscience. With these tablets thou canst confound the seducer who calls himself the Paraclete, that he may impose upon thee by a sacred name. For on the fiftieth day after the passover the tables were given; and on the fiftieth day after the passion of thy Bride-groom-of whom the passover was a type-the finger of God, the Holy Spirit, the promised Paraclete, was given. Fear not the tablets which convey to thee ancient writings now made plain. Only be not under the law, lest fear prevent thy fulfilling it; but be under grace, that love, which is the fulfilling of the law, may be in thee. For it was in a review of these very tablets that the friend of thy Bridegroom said: \"For thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is contained in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-16-P1627_892102:13-nf] One table contains the precept of love to God, and the other of love to man. And He who first sent these tablets Himself came to enjoin those precepts on Which hang the law and the prophets.[fn-16-P1628_892316:14-nf] In the first precept is the chastity of thy espousals; in the second is the unity of thy members. In the one thou art united to divinity; in the other thou dost gather a society. And these two precepts are identical with the ten, of which three relate to God, and seven to our neighbor. Such is the chaste tablet in which thy Lover and thy Beloved of old prefigured to thee the new song on a psaltery of ten strings; Himself to be extended on the cross for thee, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh, and that the righteouness of the law might be fulfilled in thee.

Or we need not at any rate take the tempting referred to in a bad sense, as if it were the device of one who sought to deceive an adversary; but we may rather suppose it to have been the result of caution, as if it were the act of one who wished to have further trial of a person who was unknown to him. For it is not without a good purpose that this sentence has been written, \"He that is hasty to give credit is light-minded, and shall be impaired.\"[fn-21-P2142_891134:511-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":76,"source_paragraph":"303","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"143. Matthew goes on thus: \"Now when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying, What think ye of Christ? Whose son is He? They say unto Him, The son of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in Spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool? If David then call Him Lord, how is He his son? And no man was able to answer Him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask Him any more questions.\"[fn-21-P2149_894229:514-nf] This is given also by Mark in due course, and in the same order.[fn-21-P2150_894320:515-nf] Luke, again, only omits mention of the person who asked the Lord which was the first commandment in the law, and, after passing over that incident in silence, observes the same order once more as the others, narrating just as these, do this question which the Lord put to the Jews concerning Christ, as to how He was David's son.[fn-21-P2151_894674:516-nf] Neither is the sense at all affected by the circumstance that, as Matthew puts it, when Jesus had asked them what they thought of Christ, and whose son He was, they [the Pharisees] replied, \"The son of David,\" and then He proposed the further query as to how David then called Him Lord; whereas, according to the version presented by the other two, Mark and Luke, we do not find either that these persons were directly interrogated, or that they made any answer. For we ought to take this view of the matter, namely, that these two evangelists have introduced the sentiments which were expressed by the Lord Himself after the reply made by those parties, and have recorded the terms in which He spoke in the hearing of those whom He wished profitably to instruct in His authority, and to turn away from the teaching of the scribes, and whose knowledge of Christ amounted then only to this, that He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, while they did not understand that He was God, and on that ground also the Lord even of David. It is in this way, therefore, that in the accounts given by these two evangelists, the Lord is mentioned in a manner which makes it appear as if He was discoursing on the subject of these erroneous teachers to men whom He desired to see delivered from the errors in which these scribes were involved. Thus, too, the question, which is presented by Matthew in the form, \"What say ye?\" is to be taken not as addressed directly to these [Pharisees], but rather as expressed only with reference to those parties, and directed really to the persons whom He was desirous of instructing.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"24. We have already said as much as appeared desirable of the curse pronounced on every one that hangs on a tree. Enough has been said to show that the command to kill any prophet or prince who tried to turn away the children of Israel from their God, or to break any commandment, is not directed against Christ. The more we consider the words and actions of our Lord Jesus Christ, the more clearly will this appear; for Christ never tried to turn away any of the Israelites from their God. The God whom Moses taught the people to love and serve, is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, whom the Lord Jesus Christ speaks of by this name, using the name in refutation of the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection of the dead. He says, \"Of the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what God said from the bush to Moses, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him.\"[fn-17-P1723_966801:44-nf] In the same words with which Christ answered the Sadducees we may answer the Manichaeans, for they too deny the resurrection, though in a different way. Again, when Christ said, in praise of the centurion's faith, \"Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel,\" He added, \"And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom shall go into outer darkness.\"[fn-17-P1724_967367:45-nf] If, then, as Faustus must admit, the God of whom Moses spoke was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, of whom Christ also spoke, as these passages prove, it follows that Christ did not try to turn away the people from their God. On the contrary, He warned them that they would go into outer darkness, because He saw that they were turned away from their God, in whose kingdom He says the Gentiles called from the whole world will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; implying that they would believe in the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. So the apostle also says: \"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-17-P1725_968148:46-nf] It is implied that those who are blessed in the seed of Abraham shall imitate the faith of Abraham. Christ, then, did not try to turn away the Israelites from their God, but rather charged them with being turned away. The idea that Christ broke one of the commandments given by Moses is not a new one, for the Jews thought so; but it is a mistake, for the Jews were in the wrong. Let Faustus mention the commandment which he supposes the Lord to have broken, and we will point out his mistake, as we have done already, when it was required. Meanwhile it is enough to say, that if the Lord had broken any commandment, He could not have found fault with the Jews for doing so. For when the Jews blamed His disciples for eating with unwashen hands, in which they transgressed not a commandment of God, but the traditions of the elders, Christ said, \"Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, that ye may observe your traditions?\" He then quotes a commandment of God, which we know to have been given by Moses. \"For God said,\" He adds, \"Honor thy father and mother, and he that curseth father or mother shall die the death. But ye say, Whoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, is not obliged to honor his father. So ye make the word of God of none effect by your traditions.\"[fn-17-P1726_969509:47-nf] From this several things maybe learned: that Christ did not turn away the Jews from their God; that He not only did not Himself break God's commandments, but found fault with those who did so; and that it was God Himself who gave these commandments by Moses.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_31_book_xviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"7. If you have learned from Manichaeus the willful impiety of admitting only those parts of the Gospel which do not contradict your errors, while you reject the rest, we have learned from the apostle the pious caution of looking on every one as accursed that preaches to us another gospel than that which we have received. Hence Catholic Christians look upon you as among the tares; for, in the Lord's exposition of the meaning of the tares, they are not falsehood mixed with truth in the Scriptures, but children of the wicked one-that is, people who imitate the deceitfulness of the devil. It is not true that Catholic Christians believe everything; for they do not believe Manichaeus or any of the heretics. Nor do they condemn the use of human reason; but what you call reasoning they prove to be fallacious. Nor do they think it profane to distinguish truth from falsehood; for they distinguish between the truth of the Catholic faith and the falsehood of your doctrines. Nor do they fear to separate good from evil; but they contend that evil, instead of being natural, is unnatural. They know nothing of your race of darkness, which, you say, is produced from a principle of its own, and fights against the kingdom of God, and of which your god seems really to be more frightened than children are of ghosts; for, according to you, he covered himself with a veil, that he might not see his own members taken and plundered by the assault of the enemy. To conclude, Catholic Christians are in no difficulty regarding the words of Christ, though in one sense they may be said not to observe the law and the prophets; for by the grace of Christ they keep the law by their love to God and man; and on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.[fn-18-P1804_1016976:11-nf] Besides, they see in Christ and the Church the fulfillment of all the prophecies of the Old Testament, whether in the form of actions, or of symbolic rites, or of figurative language.

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"31. I am disposed, after careful examination, to doubt whether the expression so often used by the Lord, \"the kingdom of heaven,\" can be found in these books. It is said, indeed, \"Love wisdom, that ye may reign for ever.\"[fn-19-P1909_1083770:68-nf] And if eternal life had not been clearly made known in the Old Testament, the Lord would not have said, as He did even to the unbelieving Jews: \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think that ye have eternal life, and they are they that testify of me.\"[fn-19-P1910_1084044:69-nf] And to the same effect are the words of the Psalmist: \"I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.\"[fn-19-P1911_1084179:70-nf] And again: \"Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.\"[fn-19-P1912_1084267:71-nf] Again, we read, \"The souls of the righteous are in the hand of the Lord, and pain shall not touch them;\" and immediately following: \"They are in peace; and if they have suffered torture from men, their hope is full of immortality; and after a few trouble, they shall enjoy many rewards.\"[fn-19-P1913_1084572:72-nf] Again, in another place: \"The righteous shall live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord, and their concern with the Highest; therefore shall they receive from the hand of the Lord a kingdom of glory and a crown of beauty.\"[fn-19-P1914_1084823:73-nf] These and many similar declarations of eternal life, in more or less explicit terms, are found in these writings. Even the resurrection of the body is spoken of by theprophets. The Pharisees, accordingly, were fierce opponents of the Sadducees, who disbelieved the resurrection. This we learn not only from the canonical Acts of the Apostles, which the Manichaeans reject, because it tells of the advent of the Paraclete promised by the Lord, but also from the Gospel, when the Sadducees question the Lord about the woman who married seven brothers, one dying after the other, whose wife she would be in the resurrection.[fn-19-P1915_1085467:74-nf] As regards, then, eternal life and the resurrection of the dead, numerous testimonies are to be found in these Scriptures. But I do not find there the expression, \"the kingdom of heaven.\" This expression belongs properly to the revelation of the New Testament, because in the resurrection our earthly bodies shall, by that change which Paul fully describes, become spiritual bodies, and so heavenly, that thus we may possess the kingdom of heaven. And this expression was reserved for Him whose advent as King to govern and Priest to sanctify His believing people, was ushered in by all the symbolism of the old covenant, in its genealogies, its typical acts and words, its sacrifices and ceremonies and feasts, and in all its prophetic utterances and events and figures. He came full of grace and truth, in His grace helping us to obey the precepts, and in His truth securing the accomplishment of the promises. He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"10. After these two steps of fear and piety, we come to the third step, knowledge, of which I have now undertaken to treat. For in this every earnest student of the Holy Scriptures exercises himself, to find nothing else in them but that God is to be loved for His own sake, and our neighbor for God's sake; and that God is to be loved with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the mind, and one's neighbor as one's self-that is, in such a way that all our love for our neighbor, like all our love for ourselves, should have reference to God.[fn-48-P4844_2623959:6-nf] And on these two commandments I touched in the previous book when I was treating about things.[fn-48-P4845_2624082:7-nf] It is necessary, then, that each man should first of all find in the Scriptures that he, through being entangled in the love of this world-i.e., of temporal things-has been drawn far away from such a love for God and such a love for his neighbor as Scripture enjoins. Then that fear which leads him to think of the judgment of God, and that piety which gives him no option but to believe in and submit to the authority of Scripture, compel him to bewail his condition. For the knowledge of a good hope makes a man not boastful, but sorrowful. And in this frame of mind he implores with unremitting prayers the comfort of the Divine help that he may not be overwhelmed in despair, and so he gradually comes to the fourth step,-that is, strength and resolution,[fn-48-P4846_2624864:8-nf] -in which he hungers and thirsts after righteousness.

But in addition to what has been said, there is this point worth consideration, since it misleads very much, if we may be outspoken about matters of such importance, Aglaophon For you said that the Lord declared plainly[fn-57-P5794_1750506:27-nf] that those who shall obtain the resurrection shall then be as the angels.[fn-57-P5795_1750616:28-nf] You brought this objection: The angels, being without flesh, are on this account in the utmost happiness and glory. We must then, as we are to be made equal to the angels, be like them stripped of flesh, and be angels. But you overlooked this, my excellent friend, that He who created and set in order the universe out of nothing, ordained the nature of immortal beings to be distributed not only among angels and ministers, but also among principalities, and thrones, and powers. For the race of angels is one, and that of principalities and powers another; because immortal beings are not all of one order, and constitution, and tribe, and family, but there are differences of race and tribe. And neither do the cherubim, departing from their own nature, assume the form of angels; nor, again, do angels assume the form of the others. For they cannot be anything but what they are and have been made. Moreover, man also having been appointed by the original order of things to inhabit the world, and to rule over all that is in it, when he is immortal, will never be changed from being a man into the form either of angels or any other; for neither do angels undergo a change from their original form to another. For Christ at His coming did not proclaim that the human nature should, when it is immortal, be remoulded or transformed into another nature, but into what it was before the fall. For each one among created things must remain in its own proper place, that none may be wanting to any, but all may be full: heaven of angels, thrones of powers, luminaries of ministers; and the more divine spots, and the undefiled and untainted luminaries, with seraphim, who attend the Supreme Council, and uphold the universe; and the world of men. For if we granted that men are changed into angels, it would follow that we say that angels also are changed into powers, and these into one thing and the other, until our argument proceed too far for safety.","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":22,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_122_from_the_discourse_on_the_resurrection_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-06","text":"XII.

Men are wont to move a question concerning a third or fourth marriage, and even more numerous marriages than this. On which to make answer strictly, I dare neither to condemn any marriage, nor to take from these the shame of their great number. But, lest the brevity of this my answer may chance to displease any, I am prepared to listen to my reprover treating more fully. For perhaps he alleges some reason, why second marriages be not condemned, but third be condemned. For I, as in the beginning of this discourse I gave warning, dare not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise.[fn-41-P4182_1974942:35-nf] For who am I, that I should think that that must be defined which I see that the Apostle hath not defined? For he saith, \"A woman is bound, so long as her husband liveth.\"[fn-41-P4183_1975133:36-nf] He said not, her first; or, second; or, third; or, fourth;[fn-41-P4184_1975217:37-nf] but, \"A woman,\" saith he, \"is bound, so long as her husband liveth; but if her husband shall be dead, she is set free; let her be married to whom she will, only in the Lord: but she shall be more blessed, if she shall have so continued.\" I know not what can be added to, or taken from, this sentence, so far as relates to this matter. Next I hear Himself also, the Master and Lord of the Apostles and of us, answering the Sadducees, when they had proposed to Him a woman not once-married, or twice-married, but, if it can be said, seven-married,[fn-41-P4185_1975790:38-nf] whose wife she should be in the resurrection? For rebuking them, He saith, \"Ye do err, not knowing. the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they shall neither be married,nor marry wives;[fn-41-P4186_1976017:39-nf] for they shall not begin todie, but shall be equal to the Angels of God.\"[fn-41-P4187_1976116:40-nf] Therefore He made mention of their resurrection, who shall rise again unto life, not who shall rise again unto punishment. Therefore He might have said, Ye do err, knowing not the Scriptures, nor the power of God: for in that resurrection it will not be possible that there be those that were wives of many; and then added, that neither doth any there marry. But neither, as we see, did He in this sentence show any sign of condemning her who was the wife of so many husbands. Wherefore neither dare I, contrary to the feeling of natural shame, say, that, when her husbands. are dead, a woman marry as often as she will; nor dare I, out of my own heart, beside the authority of holy Scripture, condemn any number of marriages whatever. But, what I say to a widow, who hath had one husband, this I say to every widow; you will be more blessed, if you shall have so continued.","title":"On the Good of Widowhood","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_32_homily_xxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Nevertheless all these darts that noble person drew out of his soul, and so shone forth after this, so wiped out the stain, became so pure, that his offspring even after his death had their sins mitigated by him: and that which was said of Abraham, we find God saying the same of this man also; or rather, much more of the latter.

Thus an irreligious Pagan might bring the same reproaches against Christ in the Gospel, as Faustus brings against God in the Old Testament. He might say that Christ lacked foresight, not only because He was astonished at the faith of the centurion, but because He chose Judas as a disciple who proved disobedient to His commands; as Faustus objects to the precept given in Paradise, which, as it turned out, was not obeyed. He might also cavil at Christ's not knowing who touched Him, when the woman suffering from an issue of blood touched the hem of His garment; as Faustus blames God for not knowing where Adam had hid himself. If this ignorance is implied in God's saying, \"Where art thou, Adam?\"[fn-20-P2054_1206281:22-nf] the same may be said of Christ's asking, \"Who touched me?\"[fn-20-P2055_1206358:23-nf] The Pagans also might call Christ timid and envious, in not wishing five of the ten virgins to gain eternal life by entering into His kingdom, and in shutting them out, so that they knocked in vain in their entreaty to have the door opened, as if forgetful of His own promise, \"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you;\"[fn-20-P2056_1206701:24-nf] as Faustus charges God with fear and envy in not admitting man after his sin to eternal life. Again, he might call Christ greedy of the blood, not of beasts, but of men, because he said, \"He that loseth his life for my sake, shall keep it unto life eternal;\"[fn-20-P2057_1206979:25-nf] as Faustus reproaches God in reference to those animal sacrifices which prefigured the sacrifice of blood-shedding by which we are redeemed. He might also accuse Christ of jealousy, because in narrating His driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple, the evangelist quotes as applicable to Him the words, \"The jealousy of Thine house hath eaten me up;\"[fn-20-P2058_1207356:26-nf] as Faustus accuses God of jealousy in forbidding sacrifices to be offered to other gods. He might say that Christ was angry with both His friends and His enemies: with His friends, because He said, \"The servant that knows his lord's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes;\" and with His enemies, because He said, \"If any one shall not receive you, shake off against him the dust of your shoes; verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for that city;\"[fn-20-P2059_1207896:27-nf] as Faustus accuses God of being angry at one time with His friends, and at another with His enemies; both of whom are spoken of thus by the apostle: \"They that have sinned without law shall perish without law, and they that have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-20-P2060_1208194:28-nf] Or he might say that Christ shed the blood of many without mercy, for a slight offense or for nothing. For to a Pagan there would appear to be little or no harm in not having a wedding garment at the marriage feast, for which our King in the Gospel commanded a man to be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness;[fn-20-P2061_1208534:29-nf] or in not wishing to have Christ for a king, which is the sin of which Christ says, \"Those that would not have me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me;\"[fn-20-P2062_1208727:30-nf] as Faustus blames God in the Old Testament for slaughtering thousands of human beings for slight offenses, as Faustus calls them, or for nothing. Again, if Faustus finds fault with God's threatening to come with the sword, and to spare neither the righteous nor the wicked, might not the Pagan. find as much fault with the words of the Apostle Paul, when he says of our God,\" He spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all;\"[fn-20-P2063_1209178:31-nf] or of Peter, when, in exhorting the saints to be patient in the midst of persecution and slaughter, he says, \"It is time that judgment begin from the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that believe not the gospel of the Lord? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?\"[fn-20-P2064_1209546:32-nf] What can be more righteous than the Only-Begotten, whom nevertheless the Father did not spare? And what can be plainer than that the righteous also are not spared, but chastised with manifold afflictions, as is clearly implied in the words, \"If the righteous scarcely are saved\"? As it is said in the Old Testament, \"Whom the Lord loveth He correcteth, and chastiseth every son whom He receiveth;\"[fn-20-P2065_1209968:33-nf] and, \"If we receive good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not also receive evil?\"[fn-20-P2066_1210071:34-nf] So we read also in the New Testament, \"Whom I love I rebuke and chasten;\"[fn-20-P2067_1210162:35-nf] and, \"If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of the Lord; but when we are judged, we are corrected of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.\"[fn-20-P2068_1210346:36-nf] If a Pagan were to make such objections to the New Testament, would not the Manichaeans try to answer them, though they themselves make similar objections to the Old Testament? But supposing them able to answer the Pagan, how absurd it would be to defend in the one Testament what they find fault with in the other! But if they could not answer the objections of the Pagan, why should they not allow in both Testaments, instead of in one only, that what appears wrong to unbelievers, from their ignorance, should be believed to be right by pious readers even when they also are ignorant?","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"64. Doubtless, the intention of Faustus' calumnies is to damage this very assertion, that Christ was born of the tribe of Judah. Especially, as in the genealogy given by Matthew we find the name of Zara, whom this woman Tamar bore to Judah. Had Faustus wished to reproach Jacob's family merely, and not Christ's birth, he might have taken the case of Reuben the first-born, who committed the unnatural crime of defiling his father's bed, of which fornication the apostle says, that it was not so much as named among the Gentiles.[fn-21-P2190_1311914:108-nf] Jacob also mentions this in his blessing, charging his son with the infamous deed. Faustus might have brought up this, as Reuben seems to have been guilty of deliberate incest, and there was no harlot's disguise in this case, were it not that Tamar's conduct in desiring nothing but to have children is more odious to Faustus than if she had acted from criminal passion, and did he not wish to discredit the incarnation, by bringing reproach on Christ's progenitors. Faustus unhappily is not aware that the most true and truthful Saviour is a teacher, not only in His words, but also in His birth. In His fleshly origin there is this lesson for those who should believe on Him from all nations, that the sins of their fathers need be no hindrance to them. Besides, the Bridegroom, who was to call good and bad to His marriage,[fn-21-P2191_1312761:109-nf] was pleased to assimilate Himself to His guests, in being born of good and bad. He thus confirms as typical of Himself the symbol of the Passover, in which it was commanded that the lamb to be eaten should be taken from the sheep or from the goats-that is, from the righteous or the wicked.[fn-21-P2192_1313075:110-nf] Preserving throughout the indication of divinity and humanity, as man He consented to have both bad and good as His parents, while as God He chose the miraculous birth from a virgin.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"74. Now, if this explanation suffices to satisfy human obstinacy and perverse misinterpretation of right actions of the vast difference between the indulgence of passion and presumption on the part of men, and obedience to the command of God, who knows what to permit or to order, and also the time and the persons, and the due action or suffering in each case, the account of the wars of Moses will not excite surprise or abhorrence, for in wars carried on by divine command, he showed not ferocity but obedience; and God in giving the command, acted not in cruelty, but in righteous retribution, giving to all what they deserved, and warning those who needed warning. What is the evil in war? Is it the death of some who will soon die in any case, that others may live in peaceful subjection? This is mere cowardly dislike, not any religious feeling. The real evils in war are love of violence, revengeful cruelty, fierce and implacable enmity, wild resistance, and the lust of power, and such like; and it is generally to punish these things, when force is required to inflict the punishment, that, in obedience to God or some lawful authority, good men undertake wars, when they find themselves in such a position as regards the conduct of human affairs, that right conduct requires them to act, or to make others act in this way. Otherwise John, when the soldiers who came to be baptized asked, What shall we do? would have replied, Throw away your arms; give up the service; never strike, or wound, or disable any one. But knowing that such actions in battle were not murderous but authorized by law, and that the soldiers did not thus avenge themselves, but defend the public safety, he replied, \"Do violence to no man, accuse no man falsely, and be content with your wages.\"[fn-22-P2219_1335554:127-nf] But as the Manichaeans are in the habit of speaking evil of John, let them hear the Lord Jesus Christ Himself ordering this money to be given to Caesar, which John tells the soldiers to be content with. \"Give,\" He says, \"to Caesar the things that are Caear's.\"[fn-22-P2220_1335836:128-nf] For tribute-money is given on purpose to pay the soldiers for war.

It possesses an enormous power of attracting and seducing the soul. In the cases where a man has got into a fixed state of sentiment, a certain imagination of the good is created in him by this habit; and nothing is so naturally vile but it may come to be thought both desirable and laudable, once it has got into the fashion[fn-27-P2721_1856577:47-nf] . Take mankind now living on the earth. There are many nations, and their ambitions are not all the same. The standard of beauty and of honour is different in each, the custom of each regulating their enthusiasm and their aims. This unlikeness is seen not only amongst nations where the pursuits of the one are in no repute with the other, but even in the same nation, and the same city, and the same family; we may see in those aggregates also much difference existing owing to customary feeling. Thus brothers born from the same throe are separated widely from each other in the aims of life. Nor is this to be wondered at, considering that each single man does not generally keep to the same opinion about the same thing, but alters it as fashion influences him. Not to go far from our present subject, we have known those who have shown themselves to be in love with chastity all through the early years of puberty; but in taking the pleasures which men think legitimate and allowable they make them the starting-point of an impure life, and when once they have admitted these temptations, all the forces of their feeling are turned in that direction, and, to take again our illustration of the stream, they let it rush from the diviner channel into low material channels, and make within themselves a broad path for passion; so that the stream of their love leaves dry the abandoned channel of the higher way[fn-27-P2722_1858199:48-nf] and flows abroad in indulgence. It would be well then, we take it, for the weaker brethren to fly to virginity as into an impregnable fortress, rather than to descend into the career of life's consequences and invite temptations to do their worst upon them, entangling themselves in those things which through the lusts of the flesh war against the law of our mind; it would be well for them to consider[fn-27-P2723_1858647:49-nf] that herein they risk not broad acres, or wealth, or any other of this life's prizes, but the hope which has been their guide. It is impossible that one who has turned to the world and feels its anxieties, and engages his heart in the wish to please men, can fulfil that first and great commandment of the Master, \"Thou shall love God with all thy heart and with all thy strength[fn-27-P2724_1859069:50-nf] .\" How can he fulfil that, when he divides his heart between God and the world, and exhausts the love which he owes to Him alone in human affections? \"He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord; but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world[fn-27-P2725_1859367:51-nf] .\" If the combat with pleasure seems wearisome, nevertheless let all take heart. Habit will not fail to produce, even in the seemingly most fretful[fn-27-P2726_1859543:52-nf] , a feeling of pleasure through the very effort of their perseverance; and that pleasure will be of the noblest and purest kind; which the intelligent may well be enamoured of, rather than allow themselves, with aims narrowed by the lowness of their objects, to be estranged from the true greatness which goes beyond all thought.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":22,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us suggest another question, namely, whether the life was the light of men only, and not of every being as well that is in blessedness. For if the life were the same thing as the light of men, and if the light of Christ were for men alone, then the life also would be only for men. But such a view is both foolish and impious, since the other Scriptures testify against this interpretation and declare that, when we are somewhat more advanced, we shall be equal to the angels.[fn-65-P6527_1113039:57-nf] The question is to be solved on the principle that when a predicate is applied to certain persons, it is not to be at once taken to apply to them alone. Thus, when the light of men is spoken of, it is not the light of men only; had that been the meaning, a word would have been added to express it; the life, it would have read, was the light of men only. For it is possible for the light of men to be the light of others besides men, just as it is possible that certain animals and certain plants may form the food of men, and that the same animals and plants should be the food of other creatures too. That is an example from common life; it is fitting that another analogy should be adduced from the inspired books. Now the question here before us, is why the light of men should not be the light of other creatures also, and we have seen that to speak of the light of men by no means excludes the possibility that the light may be that of other beings besides man, whether inferior to him or like him, Now a name is given to God; He is said to be the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. He, then, who infers from the saying, \"The life was the light of men,\" that the light is for no other than for men, ought also to conclude that the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob is the God of no one else but these three patriarchs. But He is also the God of Elijah,[fn-65-P6528_1114451:58-nf] and, as Judith says,[fn-65-P6529_1114493:59-nf] of her father Simeon, and the God of the Hebrews.

Finally, certain angels, of whom the chief is he who is called the devil, became by free will outcasts from the Lord God. Yet although they fled from His goodness, wherein they had been blessed, they could not flee from His judgment, by which they were made most wretched. Others, however, by the same free will stood fast in the truth, and merited the knowledge of that most certain truth that they should never fall.[fn-65-P6507_2485495:106-nf] For if from the Holy Scriptures we have been able to attain the knowledge that none of the holy angels shall fall evermore, how much more have they themselves attained this knowledge by the truth more sublimely revealed to them! Because to us is promised a blessed life without end, and equality with the angels,[fn-65-P6508_2485889:107-nf] from which promise we are certified that when after judgment we shall have come to that life, we shall not fall from it; but if the angels are ignorant of this truth concerning themselves, we shall not be their equals, but more blessed than they. But the Truth has promised us equality with them. It is certain, then, that they have known this by sight, which we have known by faith, to wit, that there shall be now no more any fall of any holy angel. But the devil and his angels, although they were blessed before they fell, and did not know that they should fall unto misery,-there was still something which might be added to their blessedness, if by free will they had stood in the truth, until they should receive that fulness of the highest blessing as the reward of that continuance; that is, that by the great abundance of the love of God, given by the Holy Spirit, they should absolutely not be able to fall any more, and that they should know this with complete certainty concerning themselves. They had not this plenitude of blessedness; but since they were ignorant of their future misery, they enjoyed a blessedness which was less, indeed, but still without any defect. For if they had known their future fall and eternal punishment, they certainly could not have been blessed; since the fear of so great an evil as this would compel them even then to be miserable.","title":"Treatise on Rebuke and Grace","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But if, for the contest's sake, God had appointed martyrdoms for us, that thereby we might make trial with our opponent, in order that He may now keep bruising him by whom man chose to be bruised, here too generosity rather than harshness in God holds sway. For He wished to make man, now plucked from the devil's throat by faith, trample upon him likewise by courage, that he might not merely have escaped from, but also completely vanquished, his enemy. He who had called to salvation has been pleased to summon to glory also, that they who were rejoicing in consequence of their deliverance may be in transports when they are crowned likewise. With what good-will the world celebrates those games, the combative festivals and superstitious contests of the Greeks, involving forms both of worship and of pleasure, has now become clear in Africa also. As yet cities, by sending their congratulations severally, annoy Carthage, which was presented with the Pythian game after the racecourse had attained to an old age. Thus, by the world[fn-110-P11015_3106888:38-nf] it has been believed to be a most proper mode of testing proficiency in studies, to put in competition the forms of skill, to elicit the existing condition of bodies and of voices, the reward being the informer, the public exhibition the judge, and pleasure the decision. Where there are mere contests, there are some wounds: fists make reel, heels kick like butting rams, boxing-gloves mangle, whips leave gashes. Yet there will be no one reproaching the superintendent of the contest for exposing men to outrage. Suits for injuries lie outside the racecourse. But to the extent that those persons deal in discoloration, and gore, and swellings, he will design for them crowns, doubtless, and glory, and a present, political privileges, contributions by the citizens, images, statues, and-of such sort as the world can give-an eternity of fame, a resurrection by being kept in remembrance. The pugilist himself does not complain of feeling pain, for he wishes it; the crown closes the wounds, the palm hides the blood: he is excited more by victory than by injury. Will you count this man hurt whom you see happy? But not even the vanquished himself will reproach the superintendent of the contest for his misfortune. Shall it be unbecoming in God to bring forth kinds of skill and rules of His own into public view, into this open ground of the world, to be seen by men, and angels, and all powers?-to test flesh and spirit as to stedfastness and endurance?-to give to this one the palm, to this one distinction, to that one the privilege of citizenship, to that one pay?-to reject some also, and after punishing to remove them with disgrace? You dictate to God, forsooth, the times, or the ways, or the places in which to institute a trial concerning His own troop (of competitors) as if it were not proper for the Judge to pronounce the preliminary decision also. Well now, if He had put forth faith to suffer martyrdoms not for the contest's sake, but for its own benefit, ought it not to have had some store of hope, for the increase of which it might restrain desire of its own, and check its wish in order that it might strive to mount up, seeing they also who discharge earthly functions are eager for promotion? Or how will there be many mansions in our Father's house, if not to accord with a diversity of deserts? How will one star also differ from another star in glory, unless in virtue of disparity in their rays?[fn-110-P11016_3109345:39-nf] But further, if, on that account, some increase of brightness also was appropriate to loftiness of faith, that gain ought to have been of some such sort as would cost great effort, poignant suffering, torture, death. But consider the requital, when flesh and life are paid away-than which in man there is nought more precious, the one from the hand of God, the other from His breath-that the very things are paid away in obtaining the benefit of which the benefit consists; that the very things are expended which may be acquired; that the same things are the price which are also the commodities. God had foreseen also other weaknesses incident to the condition of man,-the stratagems of the enemy, the deceptive aspects of the creatures, the snares of the world; that faith, even after baptism, would be endangered; that the most, after attaining unto salvation, would be lost again, through soiling the wedding-dress, through failing to provide oil for their torchlets-would be such as would have to be sought for over mountains and woodlands, and carried back upon the shoulders. He therefore appointed as second supplies of comfort, and the last means of succour, the fight of martyrdom and the baptism-thereafter free from danger-of blood. And concerning the happiness of the man who has partaken of these, David says: \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.\"[fn-110-P11017_3110825:40-nf] For, strictly speaking, there cannot any longer be reckoned ought against the martyrs, by whom in the baptism (of blood) life itself is laid down. Thus, \"love covers the multitude of sins; \"[fn-110-P11018_3111052:41-nf] and loving God, to wit, with all its strength (by which in the endurance of martyrdom it maintains the fight), with all its life[fn-110-P11019_3111200:42-nf] (which it lays down for God), it makes of man a martyr. Shall you call these cures, counsels, methods of judging, spectacles, (illustrations of) even the barbarity of God? Does God covet man's blood? And yet I might venture to affirm that He does, if man also covets the kingdom of heaven, if man covets a sure salvation, if man also covets a second new birth. The exchange is displeasing to no one, which can plead, in justification of itself, that either benefit or injury is shared by the parties making it.","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"No doubt the apostle admonishes the Romans[fn-111-P11107_3153559:106-nf] to be subject to all power, because there is no power but of God, and because (the ruler) does not carry the sword without reason, and is the servant of God, nay also, says he, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

It would be tedious to collect out of all the passages in the Gospels the proofs by which the God of the law and of the Gospels is shown to be one and the same. Let us touch briefly upon the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-65-P6532_1285365:41-nf] where Stephen and the other apostles address their prayers to that God who made heaven and earth, and who spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, calling Him the \"God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; \"the God who \"brought forth His people out of the land of Egypt.\" Which expressions undoubtedly clearly direct our understandings to faith in the Creator, and implant an affection for Him in those who have learned piously and faithfully thus to think of Him; according to the words of the Saviour Himself, who, when He was asked which was the greatest commandment in the law, replied, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" And to these He added: \"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-65-P6533_1286230:42-nf] How is it, then, that He commends to him whom He was instructing, and was leading to enter on the office of a disciple, this commandment above all others, by which undoubtedly love was to be kindled in him towards the God of that law, inasmuch as such had been declared by the law in these very words? But let it be granted, notwithstanding all these most evident proofs, that it is of some other unknown God that the Saviour says, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\" etc., etc. How, in that case, if the law and the prophets are, as they say, from the Creator, i.e., from another God than He whom He calls good, shall that appear to be logically said which He subjoins, viz., that \"on these two commandments hang the law and the prophets? \"For how shall that which is strange and foreign to God depend upon Him? And when Paul says, \"I thank my God, whom I serve my spirit from my forefathers with pure conscience,\"[fn-65-P6534_1287194:43-nf] he clearly shows that he came not to some new God, but to Christ. For what other forefathers of Paul can be intended, except those of whom he says, \"Are they Hebrews? so am I: are they Israelites? so am I.\"[fn-65-P6535_1287419:44-nf] Nay, will not the very preface of his Epistle to the Romans clearly show the same thing to those who know how to understand the letters of Paul, viz., what God he preaches? For his words are: \"Paul, the servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart to the Gospel of God, which He had promised afore by His prophets in the holy Scriptures concerning His Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead of Christ Jesus our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6536_1288021:45-nf] etc. Moreover, also the following, \"Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn.

Now I think they must, in the first place, be required to show, if they can, agreeably to their own definition, that the Creator is just in punishing according to their deserts, either those who perished at the time of the deluge, or the inhabitants of Sodom, or those who had quitted Egypt, seeing we sometimes behold committed crimes more wicked and detestable than those for which the above-mentioned persons were destroyed, while we do not yet sere every sinner paying the penalty of his misdeeds. Will they say that He who at one time was just has been made good? Or will they rather be of opinion that He is even now just, but is patiently enduring human offences, while that then He was not even just, inasmuch as He exterminated innocent and sucking children along with cruel and ungodly giants? Now, such are their opinions, because they know not how to understand anything beyond the letter; otherwise they would show how it is literal justice for sins to be visited upon the heads of children to the third and fourth generation, and on children's children after them. By us, however, such things are not understood literally; but, as Ezekiel taught[fn-65-P6553_1298568:56-nf] when relating the parable, we inquire what is the inner meaning contained in the parable itself. Moreover, they ought to explain this also, how He is just, and rewards every one according to his merits, who punishes earthly-minded persons and the devil, seeing they have done nothing worthy of punishment.[fn-65-P6554_1298895:57-nf] For they could not do any good if, according to them, they were of a wicked and ruined nature. For as they style Him a judge, He appears to be a judge not so much of actions as of natures; and if a bad nature cannot do good, neither can a good nature do evil. Then, in the next place, if He whom the), call good is good to all, He is undoubtedly good also to those who are destined to perish. And why does He not save them? If He does not desire to do so, He will be no longer good; if He does desire it, and cannot effect it, He will not be omnipotent. Why do they not rather hear the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospels, preparing fire for the devil and his angels? And how shall that proceeding, as penal as it is sad, appear to be, according to their view, the work of the good God? Even the Saviour Himself, the Son of the good God, protests in the Gospels, and declares that \"if signs and wonders had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented[fn-65-P6555_1299914:58-nf] long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.\" And when He had come near to those very cities, and had entered their territory, why, pray, does He avoid entering those cities, and exhibiting to them abundance of signs and wonders, if it were certain that they would have repented, after they had been performed, in sackcloth and ashes? But as He does not do this, He undoubtedly abandons to destruction those whom the language of the Gospel shows not to have been of a wicked or mined nature, inasmuch as it declares they were capable of repentance. Again, in a certain parable of the Gospel, where the king enters in to see the guests reclining at the banquet, he beheld a certain individual not clothed with wedding raiment, and said. to him, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? \"and then ordered his servants, \"Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"[fn-65-P6556_1300886:59-nf] Let them tell us who is that king who entered in to see the guests, and finding one amongst them with unclean garments, commanded him to be bound by his servants, and thrust out into outer darkness. Is he the same whom they call just? How then had he commanded good and bad alike to be invited, without directing their merits to be inquired into by his servants? By such procedure would be indicated, not the character of a just God who rewards according to men's deserts, as they assert, but of one who displays undiscriminating goodness towards all. Now, if this must necessarily be understood of the good God, i.e., either of Christ or of the Father of Christ, what other objection can they bring against the justice of God's judgment? Nay, what else is there so unjust charged by them against the God of the law as to order him who had been invited by His servants, whom He had sent to call good and bad alike, to be bound hand and foot, and to be thrown into outer darkness, because he had on unclean garments?","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":22,"verse":39,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_131_the_second_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-08","text":"You desired also to consult us, as we find in the above-mentioned letter of yours, on the subject of the accusing of priest,-a thing which, as we learn also from the same epistle, is exceedingly frequent among you.

Why, then, said the Son to the mother, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come?\" Our Lord Jesus Christ was both God and man. According as He was God, He had not a mother; according as He was man, He had. She was the mother, then, of His flesh, of His humanity, of the weakness which for our sakes He took upon Him. But the miracle which He was about to do, He was about to do according to His divine nature, not according to His weakness; according to that wherein He was God not according to that wherein He was born weak. But the weakness of God is stronger than men.[fn-5-P581_270807:9-nf] His mother then demanded a miracle of Him; but He, about to perform divine works, so far did not recognize a human womb; saying in effect, \"That in me which works a miracle was not born of thee, thou gavest not birth to my divine nature; but because my weakness was born of thee, I will recognize thee at the time when that same weakness shall hang upon the cross.\" This, indeed, is the meaning of \"Mine hour is not yet come.\" For then it was that He recognized, who, in truth, always did know. He knew His mother in predestination, even before He was born of her; even before, as God, He created her of whom, as man, He was to be created, He knew her as His mother: but at a certain hour in a mystery He did not recognize her; and at a certain hour which had not yet come, again in a mystery, He does recognize her. For then did He recognize her, when that to which she gave birth was a-dying. That by which Mary was made did not die, but that which was made of Mary; not the eternity of the divine nature, but the weakness of the flesh, was dying. He made that answer therefore, making a distinction in the faith of believers, between the who; and the how, He came. For whiIe He was God and the Lord of heaven and earth, He came by a mother who was a woman. In that He was Lord of the world, Lord of heaven and earth, He was, of course, the Lord of Mary also; but in that wherein it is said, \"Made of a woman, made under the law,\" He was Mary's son. The same both the Lord of Mary and the son of Mary; the same both the Creator of Mary and created from Mary. Marvel not that He was both son and Lord. For just as He is called the son of Mary, so likewise is He called the son of David; and son of David because son of Mary. Hear the apostle openly declaring, \"Who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-5-P582_272647:10-nf] Hear Him also declared the Lord of David; let David himself declare this: \"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-5-P583_272795:11-nf] And this passage Jesus Himself brought forward to the Jews, and refuted them from it.[fn-5-P584_272897:12-nf] How then was He both David's son and David's Lord? David's son according to the flesh, David's Lord according to His divinity; so also Mary's son after the flesh, and Mary's Lord after His majesty. Now as she was not the mother of His divine nature, whilst it was by His divinity the miracle she asked for would be wrought, therefore He answered her, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\" But think not that I deny thee to be my mother: \"Mine hour is not yet come;\" for in that hour I will acknowledge thee, when the weakness of which thou art the mother comes to hang on the cross. Let us prove the truth of this. When the Lord suffered, the same evangelist tells us, who knew the mother of the Lord, and who has given us to know about her in this marriage feast,-the same, I say, tells us, \"There was there near the cross the mother of Jesus; and Jesus saith to His mother, Woman, behold thy son! and to the disciple, Behold thy mother!\"[fn-5-P585_273853:13-nf] He commends His mother to the care of the disciple; commends His mother, as about to die before her, and to rise again before her death. The man commends her a human being to man's care. This humanity had Mary given birth to. That hour had now come, the hour of which He had then said, \"Mine hour is not yet come.\"","title":"Tractate VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":95,"source_paragraph":"520","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"For [God] sets before every race of mankind that which is always and universally just, as well as all righteousness; and every race knows that adultery, and fornication, and homicide,[fn-48-P4872_1067308:365-nf] and such like, are sinful; and though they all commit such practices, yet they do not escape from the knowledge that they act unrighteously whenever they so do, with the exception of those who are possessed with an unclean spirit, and who have been debased by education, by wicked customs, and by sinful institutions, and who have lost, or rather quenched and put under, their natural ideas. For we may see that such persons are unwilling to submit to the same things which they inflict upon others, and reproach each other with hostile consciences for the acts which they perpetrate. And hence I think that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ spoke well when He summed up all righteousness and piety in two commandments. They are these: `Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.'[fn-48-P4873_1068206:366-nf] For the man who loves God with all the heart, and with all the strength, being filled with a God-fearing mind, will reverence no other god; and since God wishes it, he would reverence that angel who is beloved by the same Lord and God. And the man who loves his neighbour as himself will wish for him the same good things that he wishes for himself, and no man will wish evil things for himself. Accordingly, he who loves his neighbour would pray and labour that his neighbour may be possessed of the same benefits as himself. Now nothing else is neighbour to man than that similarly-affectioned and reasonable being-man. Therefore, since all righteousness is divided into two branches, namely, in so far as it regards God and men, whoever, says the Scripture, loves the Lord God with all the heart, and all the strength, and his neighbour as himself, would be truly a righteous man. But you were never shown to be possessed of friendship or love either towards God, or towards the prophets, or towards yourselves, but, as is evident, you are ever found to be idolaters and murderers of righteous men, so that you laid hands even on Christ Himself; and to this very day you abide in your wickedness, execrating those who prove that this man who was crucified by you is the Christ. Nay, more than this, you suppose that He was crucified as hostile to and cursed by God, which supposition is the product of your most irrational mind. For though you have the means of understanding that this man is Christ from the signs given by Moses, yet you will not; but, in addition, fancying that we can have no arguments, you put whatever question comes into your minds, while you yourselves are at a loss for arguments whenever you meet with some firmly established Christian.","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":22,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_48_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"ANF-04","text":"29.

For it is absurd to say that Christ was in Peter and in Paul, but not in Michael the archangel, nor in Gabriel. And from this it is distinctly shown that the divinity of the Son of God was not shut up in some place; otherwise it would have been in it only, and not in another.

But the inculpatory and dehortatory forms of speech have been already shown us; and we must now handle the persuasive and the laudatory, and, as on a beam, balance the equal scales of justice. The exhortation to what is useful, the Instructor employs by Solomon, to the following effect: \"I exhort you, O men; and I utter my voice to the sons of men.

We must guard against speaking anything while eating: for the voice becomes disagreeable and inarticulate when it is confined by full jaws; and the tongue, pressed by the food and impeded in its natural energy; gives forth a compressed utterance. Nor is it suitable to eat and to drink simultaneously. For it is the very extreme of intemperance to confound the times whose uses are discordant. And \"whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God,\"[fn-37-P3755_1140452:38-nf] aiming after true frugality, which the Lord also seems to me to have hinted at when He blessed the loaves and the cooked fishes with which He feasted the disciples, introducing a beautiful example of simple food. That fish then which, at the command of the Lord, Peter caught, points to digestible and God-given and moderate food. And by those who rise from the water to the bait of righteousness, He admonishes us to take away luxury and avarice, as the coin from the fish; in order that He might displace vainglory; and by giving the stater to the tax-gatherers, and \"rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's,\" might preserve \"to God the things which are God's.\"[fn-37-P3756_1141146:39-nf] The staler is capable of other explanations not unknown to us, but the present is not a suitable occasion for their treatment. Let the mention we make for our present purpose suffice, as it is not unsuitable to the flowers of the Word; and we have often done this, drawing to the urgent point of the question the most beneficial fountain, in order to water those who have been planted by the Word. \"For if it is lawful for me to partake of all things, yet all things are not expedient.\"[fn-37-P3757_1141654:40-nf] For those that do all that is lawful, quickly fall into doing what is unlawful. And just as righteousness is not attained by avarice, nor temperance by excess; so neither is the regimen of a Christian formed by indulgence; for the table of truth is far from lascivious dainties. For though it was chiefly for men's sake that all things were made, yet it is not good to use all things, nor at all times. For the occasion, and the time, and the mode, and the intention, materially turn the balance with reference to what is useful, in the view of one who is rightly instructed; and this is suitable, and has influence in putting a stop to a life of gluttony, which wealth is prone to choose, not that wealth which sees clearly, but that abundance which makes a man blind with reference to gluttony. No one is poor as regards necessaries, and a man is never overlooked. For there is one God who feeds the fowls and the fishes, and, in a word, the irrational creatures; and not one thing whatever is wanting to them, though \"they take no thought for their food.\"[fn-37-P3758_1142732:41-nf] And we are better than they, being their lords, and more closely allied to God, as being wiser; and we were made, not that we might eat and drink, but that we might devote ourselves to the knowledge of God. \"For the just man who eats is satisfied in his soul, but the belly of the wicked shall want,\"[fn-37-P3759_1143052:42-nf] filled with the appetites of insatiable gluttony. Now lavish expense is adapted not for enjoyment alone, but also for social communication. Wherefore we must guard against those articles of food which persuade us to eat when we are not hungry, bewitching the appetite. For is there not within a temperate simplicity a wholesome variety of eatables? Bulbs,[fn-37-P3760_1143428:43-nf] olives, certain herbs, milk, cheese, fruits, all kinds of cooked food without sauces; and if flesh is wanted, let roast rather than boiled be set down. Have you anything to eat here? said the Lord[fn-37-P3761_1143686:44-nf] to the disciples after the resurrection; and they, as taught by Him to practise frugality, \"gave Him a piece of broiled fish; \"and having eaten before them, says Luke, He spoke to them what He spoke. And in addition to these, it is not to be overlooked that those who feed according to the Word are not debarred from dainties in the shape of honey-combs. For of articles of food, those are the most suitable which are fit for immediate use without fire, since they are readiest; and second to these are those which are simplest, as we said before. But those who bend around inflammatory tables, nourishing their own diseases, are ruled by a most lickerish demon, whom I shall not blush to call the Belly-demon, and the worst and most abandoned of demons. He is therefore exactly like the one who is called the Ventriloquist-demon. It is far better to be happy[fn-37-P3762_1144569:45-nf] than to have a demon dwelling with us. And happiness is found in the practice of virtue. Accordingly, the apostle Matthew partook of seeds, and nuts,[fn-37-P3763_1144773:46-nf] and vegetables, without flesh. And John, who carded temperance to the extreme, \"ate locusts and wild honey.\" Peter abstained from swine; \"but a trance fell on him,\" as is written in the Acts of the Apostles, \"and he saw heaven opened, and a vessel let down on the earth by the four corners, and all the four-looted beasts and creeping things of the earth and the fowls of heaven in it; and there came a voice to him, Rise, and slay, and eat. And Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten what is common or unclean. And the voice came again to him the second time, What God hath cleansed, call not thou common.\"[fn-37-P3764_1145429:47-nf] The use of them is accordingly indifferent to us. \"For not what entereth into the mouth defileth the man,\"[fn-37-P3765_1145556:48-nf] but the vain opinion respecting uncleanness. For God, when He created man, said, \"All things shall be to you for meat.\"[fn-37-P3766_1145695:49-nf] \"And herbs, with love, are better than a calf with fraud.\"[fn-37-P3767_1145774:50-nf] This well reminds us of what was said above, that herbs are not love, but that our meals are to be taken with love;[fn-37-P3768_1145909:51-nf] and in these the medium state is good. In all things, indeed, this is the case, and not least in the preparation made for feasting, since the extremes are dangerous, and middle courses good. And to be in no want of necessaries is the medium. For the desires which are in accordance with nature are bounded by sufficiency. The Jews had frugality enjoined on them by the law in the most systematic manner. For the Instructor, by Moses, deprived them of the use of innumerable things, adding reasons-the spiritual ones hidden; the carnal ones apparent, to which indeed they have trusted; in the case of some animals, because they did not part the hoof, and others because they did not ruminate their food, and others because alone of aquatic animals they were devoid of scales ; so that altogether but a few were left appropriate for their food. And of those that he permitted them to touch, he prohibited such as had died, or were offered to idols, or had been strangled; for to touch these was unlawful. For since it is impossible for those who use dainties to abstain from partaking of them, he appointed the opposite mode of life, till he should break down the propensity to indulgence arising from habit. Pleasure has often produced in men harm and pain; and full feeding begets in the soul uneasiness, and forgetfulness, and foolishness. And they say that the bodies of children, when shooting up to their height, are made to grow right by deficiency in nourishment. For then the spirit, which pervades the body in order to its growth, is not checked by abundance of food obstructing the freedom of its course. Whence that truth-seeking philosopher Plato, fanning the spark of the Hebrew philosophy when condemning a life of luxury, says: \"On my coming hither, the life which is here called happy, full of Italian and Syracusan tables, pleased me not by any means, [consisting as it did] in being filled twice a day, and never sleeping by night alone, and whatever other accessories attend the mode of life.

If they ever could understand or had understood what they read, they would never speak after such a perilous fashion. But the folly of error is always hasty in its descent, and it is no new thing if those who have forsaken the lawful faith descend even to perilous results. For if Scripture were to set forth that Christ is God only, and that there was no association of human weakness mingled in His nature, this intricate argument of theirs might reasonably avail something. If Christ is God, and Christ died, then God died. But when Scripture determines, as we have frequently shown, that He is not only God, but man also, it follows that what is immortal may be held to have remained uncorrupted. For who cannot understand that the divinity is impassible, although the human weakness is liable to suffering? When, therefore, Christ is understood to be mingled and associated as well of that which God is, as of that which man is-for \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us\"-who cannot easily apprehend of himself, without any teacher and interpreter, that it was not that in Christ that died which is God, but that in Him died which is man? For what if the divinity in Christ does not die, but the substance of the flesh only is destroyed, when in other men also, who are not flesh only, but flesh and soul, the flesh indeed alone suffers the inroads of wasting and death, while the soul is seen to be uncorrupted, and beyond the laws of destruction and death? For this also our Lord Himself said, exhorting us to martyrdom and to contempt of all human power: \"Fear not those who slay the body, but cannot kill the soul.\"[fn-103-P10359_3259908:193-nf] But if the immortal soul cannot be killed or slain in any other, although the body and flesh by itself can be slain, how much rather assuredly could not the Word of God and God in Christ be put to death at all, although the flesh alone and the body was slain! For if in any man whatever, the soul has this excellence of immortality that it cannot be slain, much more has the nobility of the Word of God this power of not being slain. For if the power of men fails to slay the sacred power of God, and if the cruelty of man fails to destroy the soul, much more ought it to fail to slay the Word of God. For as the soul itself, which was made by the Word of God, is not killed by men, certainly much rather will it be believed that the Word of God cannot be destroyed. And if the sanguinary cruelty of men cannot do more against men than only to slay the body, how much more certainly it will not have power against Christ beyond in the same way slaying the body! So that, while from these considerations it is gathered that nothing but the human nature in Christ was put to death, it appears that the Word in Him was not drawn down into mortality. For if Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who, it is admitted, were only men, are manifested to be alive-for all they,[fn-103-P10360_3261191:194-nf] says He, \"live unto God; \"and death in them does not destroy the soul, although it dissolves the bodies themselves: for it could exercise its power on the bodies, it did not avail to exercise it on the souls: for the one in them was mortal, and therefore died; the other in them was immortal, and therefore is understood not to have been extinguished: for which reason they are affirmed and said to live unto God,-much rather death in Christ could have power against the material of His body alone, while against the divinity of the Word it could not bring itself to bear. For the power of death is broken when the authority of immortality intervenes.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"244","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the ungodly shall perish.\"[fn-46-P4611_1417696:173-nf] \"Follow, therefore, O son, the good way which I shall describe, lending to me attentive ears.\" \"And I will give to thee the treasures of darkness, hidden and unseen\"[fn-46-P4612_1417879:174-nf] by the nations, but seen by us.

And so it is that often something is imperfectly revealed to the more learned, that their patient and humble charity, from which proceeds the greater fruit, may be proved, either in the way in which they preserve unity, when they hold different opinions on matters of comparative obscurity, or in the temper with which they receive the truth, when they learn that it has been declared to be contrary to what they thought. And of these two we have a manifestation in the blessed Cyprian of the one, viz., of the way in which he preserved unity with those from whom he differed in opinion. For he says, \"Judging no one nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us.\"[fn-31-P3191_1858137:13-nf] And the other, viz., in what temper he could receive the truth when found to be different from what he thought it, though his letters are silent on the point, is yet proclaimed by his merits. If there is no letter extant to prove it, it is witnessed by his crown of martyrdom; if the Council of bishops declare it not, it is declared by the host of angels. For it is no small proof of a most peaceful soul, that he won the crown of martyrdom in that unity from which he would not separate, even though he differed from it. For we are but men; and it is therefore a temptation incident to men that we should hold views at variance with the truth on any point. But to come through too great love for our own opinion, or through jealousy of our betters, even to the sacrilege of dividing the communion of the Church, and of rounding heresy or schism, is a presumption worthy of the devil. But never in any point to entertain an opinion at variance with the truth is perfection found only in the angels. Since then we are men, yet forasmuch as in hope we are angels, whose equals we shall be in the resurrections,[fn-31-P3192_1859273:14-nf] at any rate, so long as we are wanting in the perfection of angels, let us at least be without the presumption of the devil. Accordingly the apostle says, \"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man.\"[fn-31-P3193_1859516:15-nf] It is therefore part of man's nature to be sometimes wrong. Wherefore he says in another place, \"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.\"[fn-31-P3194_1859769:16-nf] But to whom does He reveal it when it is His will (be it in this life or in the life to come), save to those who walk in the way of peace, and stray not aside into any schism? Not to such as those who have not known the way of peace,[fn-31-P3195_1860023:17-nf] or for some other cause have broken the bond of unity. And so, when the apostle said, \"And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,\" lest they should think that besides the way of peace their own wrong views might be revealed to them, he immediately added, \"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.\"[fn-31-P3196_1860432:18-nf] And Cyprian, walking by this rule, by the most persistent tolerance, not simply by the shedding of his blood, but because it was shed in unity (for if he gave his body to be burned, and had not charity, it would profit him nothing[fn-31-P3197_1860683:19-nf] ), came by the confession of martyrdom to the light of the angels, and if not before, at least then, acknowledged the revelation of the truth on that point on which, while yet in error, he did not prefer the maintenance of a wrong opinion to the bond of unity.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_48_epistle_xx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"19.

For no man even though he were to call himself a Christian a thousand times over, or a monk, confesses God when he is sinning: no man who allows those things which the Lord hates, remembereth God, nor calls himself with any truth the servant of Him, whose commands he scorns with obstinate rashness: in which death the blessed Apostle declares that the widow is involved, who gives herself to pleasure, saying \"a widow who giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-35-P3556_1327115:28-nf] There are then many who while still living in this body are dead, and lying in the grave cannot praise God; and on the contrary there are many who though they are dead in the body yet bless God in the spirit, and praise Him, according to this: \"O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord:\"[fn-35-P3557_1327439:29-nf] and \"every spirit shall praise the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3558_1327506:30-nf] And in the Apocalypse the souls of them that are slain are not only said to praise God but to address Him also.[fn-35-P3559_1327634:31-nf] In the gospel too the Lord says with still greater clearness to the Sadducees: \"Have ye not read that which was spoken by God, when He said to you: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all do live unto Him.\"[fn-35-P3560_1327951:32-nf] Of whom also the Apostle says: \"wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He hath prepared for them a city.\"[fn-35-P3561_1328103:33-nf] For that they are not idle after the separation from this body, and are not incapable of feeling, the parable in the gospel shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and Dives clothed in purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e., Abraham's bosom, the other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal fire.[fn-35-P3562_1328445:34-nf] But if you care too to understand the words spoken to the thief \"To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,\"[fn-35-P3563_1328582:35-nf] what do they clearly show but that not only does their former intelligence continue with the souls, but also that in their changed condition they partake of some state which corresponds to their actions and deserts? For the Lord would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At least we must avoid, and shunwith the utmost horror, that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ could be found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into hell, thus punctuate \"Verily, I say unto you to-day,\" and making a stop apply \"thou shall be with. Me in Paradise, in such a way that they imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after he departed from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the resurrection,[fn-35-P3564_1329596:36-nf] as they do not understand what before the time of His resurrection He declared to the Jews, who fancied that He was hampered by human difficulties and weakness of the flesh as they were: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven:\"[fn-35-P3565_1330070:37-nf] by which He clearly shows that the souls of the departed are not only not deprived of their reason, but that they are not even without such feelings as hope and sorrow, joy and fear, and that they already are beginning to taste beforehand something of what is reserved for them at the last judgment, and that they are not as some unbelievers hold resolved into nothing after their departure from this life:[fn-35-P3566_1330499:38-nf] but that they live a more real life, and are still more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And indeed to put aside for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and likeness of God consists,[fn-35-P3567_1331546:39-nf] will, when the burden of the body with which it is oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh sensible, by participation with it: especially when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that when the mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it will restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a purer and finer condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:\" and therefore \"we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. Wherefore also we strive, whether absent or present, to be pleasing to Him;\"[fn-35-P3568_1332647:40-nf] and he declares indeed that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is distance from the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that its separation and departure from this flesh involves presence with Christ. And again still more clearly the same Apostle speaks of this state of the souls as one that is very full of life: \"But ye are come to Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first born, who are written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect.\"[fn-35-P3569_1333265:41-nf] Of which spirits he speaks in another passage, \"Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?\"[fn-35-P3570_1333480:42-nf] ","title":"I.

And, thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-46-P4661_2509667:34-nf] See here of what commandments this whole epistle talks. Therefore hold fast love, and set your minds at rest. Why fearest thou lest thou do evil to some man? Who does evil to the man he loves? Love[fn-46-P4662_2509890:35-nf] thou: it is impossible to do this without doing good. But it may be, thou rebukest? Kindness[fn-46-P4663_2509996:36-nf] does it, not fierceness. But it may be thou beatest? For discipline thou dost this; because thy kindness of love[fn-46-P4664_2510120:37-nf] will not let thee leave him undisciplined. And indeed there come somehow these different and contrary results, that sometimes hatred uses winning ways, and charity shows itself fierce. A person hates his enemy, and feigns friendship for him: he sees him doing some evil, he praises him: he wishes him to go headlong, wishes him to go blind over the precipice of his lusts, haply never to return; he praises him, \"For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul;\"[fn-46-P4665_2510618:38-nf] he applies to him the unction of adulation; behold, he hates, and praises. Another sees his friend doing something of the same sort; he calls him back; if he will not hear, he uses words even of castigation, he scolds, he quarrels:[fn-46-P4666_2510865:39-nf] there are times when it comes to this, that one must even quarrel! Behold, hatred shows itself winningly gentle, and charity quarrels! Stay not thy regard upon the words of seeming kindness, or the seeming cruelty of the rebuke; look into the vein[fn-46-P4667_2511127:40-nf] they come from; seek the root whence they proceed. The one is gentle and bland that he may deceive, the other quarrels that he may correct. Well then, it is not for us, brethren, to enlarge your heart: obtain from God the gift to love one another. Love all men, even your enemies, not because they are your brethren, but that they may be your brethren; that ye may be at all times on fire with brotherly love, whether toward him that is become thy brother, or towards thine enemy, so that, by being beloved, he may become thy brother. Wheresoever ye love a brother, ye love a friend. Now is he with thee, now is he knit to thee in unity, yea catholic unity. If thou art living aright, thou lovest a brother made out of an enemy. But thou lovest some man who has not yet believed Christ, or, if he have believed, believes as do the devils: thou rebukest his vanity. Do thou love, and that with a brotherly love: he is not yet a brother, but thou lovest to the end he may be a brother. Well then, all our love is a brotherly love, towards Christians, towards all His members.

And so when we have succeeded in this, we shall be able to arrive at the third as well, in which we go forth from the house of our former parent, (who, as we know well, was our father from our Very birth, after the old man, when we were \"by nature children of wrath, as others also,\"[fn-38-P3832_1428347:14-nf] ) and fix our whole mental gaze on things celestial. And of this father Scripture says to Jerusalem which had despised God the true Father, \"Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite;\"[fn-38-P3833_1428559:15-nf] and in the gospel we read \"Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye love to do.\"[fn-38-P3834_1428682:16-nf] And when we have left him, as we pass from things visible to things unseen we shall be able to say with the Apostle: \"But we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a habitation from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\"[fn-38-P3835_1428978:17-nf] and this also, which we quoted a little while ago: \"But our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who will reform the body of our low estate made like to the body of His glory,\"[fn-38-P3836_1429216:18-nf] and this of the blessed David: \"For I am a sojourner upon the earth,\" and \"a stranger as all my fathers were;\"[fn-38-P3837_1429351:19-nf] so that we may in accordance with the Lord's word be made like those of whom the Lord speaks to His Father in the gospel as follows: \"They are not of the world, as I am not of the world,\"[fn-38-P3838_1429594:20-nf] and again to the Apostles themselves: \"If ye were of this world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of this world, therefore the world hateth you.\"[fn-38-P3839_1429783:21-nf] Of this third renunciation then we shall succeed in reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sullied by no stain of carnal coarseness, but, all such having been carefully eliminated, it has been freed from every earthly quality and desire, and by constant meditation on things Divine, and spiritual contemplation has so far passed on to things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things above and things spiritual it no longer feels that it is prisoned in this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up into such an ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy itself with gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see things close at hand, or large objects straight before the very eyes. And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except one who has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience; viz., one, the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all things present, so that he no longer considers them as things that will soon pass away, but as things that are already done with, and sees them vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, \"walking with God,\" and \"translated\" from human life and fashions, not \"be found\" amid the vanities of this life: And that this actually happened corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus tells us. \"And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him.\" And the Apostle also says: \"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,\" the death namely of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"He that liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally.\"[fn-38-P3840_1431450:22-nf] Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought to look to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of parents, home, the riches and pleasures of the world, we may also inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and never be drawn back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those who were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are yet said to have returned in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who had led them forth with such mighty signs, and by worshipping the idols of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says: \"And in their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us,\"[fn-38-P3841_1432211:23-nf] for we should fall into like condemnation with those who, while dwelling in the wilderness, after they had tasted manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and of mean baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way: \"It was well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate the onions, and garlic, and cucumbers, and melons:\"[fn-38-P3842_1432612:24-nf] A form of speech, which, although it referred primarily to that people, we yet see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who after renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts to his former likings asserts in heart and act the very same thing that they did, and says \"It was well with me in Egypt,\" and I am afraid that the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of backsliders of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned as six hundred and three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of this number not more than two entered the land of promise. Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have spoken in the gospel \"Many are called but few\" are said to be \"chosen.\"[fn-38-P3843_1433511:25-nf] A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place from Egypt will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-38-P3844_1433955:26-nf] And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while pride or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher. But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say \"If I bestow my goods.\" For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted persons do. But he says \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,\" i.e., even if my renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this renunciation he adds something still greater: \"And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:\" As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,\"[fn-38-P3845_1435398:27-nf] renouncing them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as to give up my body for Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former sins, because, while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance, which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that love of the Lord which is patient, which is \"kind, which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry, dealeth not perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil,\" which \"beareth all things, endureth all things,\"[fn-38-P3846_1436459:28-nf] and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of sin.","title":"III.

If, however, what I have stated be insufficient to convince any one that the prophets were sent from one and the same Father, from whom also our Lord was sent, let such a one, opening the mouth of his heart, and calling upon the Master, Christ Jesus the Lord, listen to Him when He says, \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a king who made a marriage for his son, and he sent forth his servants to call them who were bidden to the marriage.\" And when they would not obey, He goes on to say, \"Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Come ye, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and all the fallings are killed, and everything is ready; come unto the wedding.

Go out therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, gather in to the marriage. So the servants went out, and collected together as many as they found, bad and good, and the wedding was furnished with guests. But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man not having on a wedding garment; and he said unto him, Friend, how camest thou hither, not having on a wedding garment?

He accordingly sent forth His armies and destroyed them, and burned down their city; but He called together from all the highways, that is, from all nations, [guests] to the marriage feast of His Son, as also He says by Jeremiah: \"I have sent also unto you my servants the prophets to say, Return ye now, every man, from his very evil way, and amend your doings.\"[fn-87-P8788_2497863:578-nf] And again He says by the same prophet: \"I have also sent unto you my servants the prophets throughout the day and before the light; yet they did not obey me, nor incline their ears unto me.

For \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein.\"[fn-87-P8797_2501342:586-nf] Wherefore also the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Romans, \"For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive unto themselves condemnation. For rulers are not for a terror to a good work, but to an evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the minister of God to thee for good.

Others indeed they deceived by these professions, but when our Lord became man they were not able to deceive Him; `for the Word was made Flesh,' who `knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vain.' Thus He exposed the carping of the Jews, saying, `If God were your Father, ye would love Me, for I proceeded forth from the Father, and am come to you[fn-39-P3989_1672415:62-nf] .' In like manner these men seem now to act; for they disguise their real sentiments, and then make use of the language of Scripture for their writings, which they hold forth as a bait for the ignorant, that they may inveigle them into their own wickedness.","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_22_tractate_xvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Hear also the apostle when he says, \"Love is the fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-9-P940_527208:7-nf] Whence the love? By the grace of God, by the Holy Spirit. For we could not have it from ourselves, as if making it for ourselves. It is the gift of God, and a great gift it is: for, saith he, \"the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given to us.\"[fn-9-P941_527504:8-nf] Wherefore love completes the law, and most truly it is said, \"Love is the perfecting of the law.\" Let us inquire as to thislove, in what manner the Lord doth commend it to our consideration. Remember what I laid down: I want to explain the number thirty-eight of the years of that impotent man, why that number thirty-eight is one of weakness rather than of health. Now, as I was saying, love fulfills the law. The number forty belongs to the perfecting of the law in all works; but in love two precepts are committed to our keeping. Keep before your eyes, I beseech you, and fix in your memory, what I say; be ye not despisers of the word, that your soul may not become a trodden path, where the seed cast cannot sprout, \"and the fowls of the air will come and gather it up.\" Apprehend it, and lay it up in your hearts. The precepts of love, given to us by the Lord, are two: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;\" and, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-9-P942_528605:9-nf] With good reason did the widow cast \"two mites,\" all her substance, into the offerings of God: with good reason did the host take \"two\" pieces of money, for the poor man that was wounded by the robbers, for his making whole: with good reason did Jesus spent two days with the Samaritans, to establish them in love. Thus, whilst a certain good thing is generally signified by this number two, most especially is love in its twofold character set forth to us thereby. If, therefore, the number forty possesses the perfecting of the law, and the law is fulfilled only in the twin precepts of love, why dost thou wonder that he was weak and sick, who was short of forty by two?","title":"Tractate XVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_67_homily_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Observe the discretion of Paul, how after encouraging by the gentler things, he turns his discourse to the more fearful.

And he was speechless.\"[fn-48-P4845_2077206:15-nf] For He who questioned him was One, to whom he could give no feigned reply. The garment that was looked for is in the heart, not on the body; for had it been put on externally, it could not have been concealed even from the servants. Where that wedding garment must be put on, hear in the words, \"Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness.\"[fn-48-P4846_2077571:16-nf] Of that garment the Apostle speaks,[fn-48-P4847_2077627:17-nf] \"If so be that we shall be found clothed, and not naked.\"[fn-48-P4848_2077736:18-nf] Therefore was he discovered by the Lord, who escaped the notice of the servants. Being questioned, he is speechless: he is bound, cast out, and condemned one by many. I have said, Lord, that Thou teachest us that in this Thou dost give warning to all. Recollect then with me, my Brethren, the words which ye have heard, and ye will at once discover, at once determine, that that one was many. True it was one man whom the Lord questioned, to one He said, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither?\" It was one who was speechless, and of that same one was it said, \"Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"[fn-48-P4849_2078417:19-nf] Why? \"For many are called, but few chosen.\"[fn-48-P4850_2078482:20-nf] How can any one gainsay this manifestation of the truth? \"Cast him,\" He saith, \"into outer darkness.\" \"Him,\" that one man assuredly, of whom the Lord saith, \"for many are called, but few chosen.\" So then it is the few who are not cast out. He was it is true but one man \"who had not the wedding garment. Cast him out.\" But why is he cast out? \"For many are called, but few chosen.\" Leave alone the few, cast out the many. It is true, that man was but one. Yet undoubtedly that one not only was many, but those many in numbers far surpassed the number of the good. For the good are many also; but in comparison of the bad, they are few. In the crop there is much wheat; compare it with the chaff, and the grains of corn are few. The same persons considered in themselves are many, in comparison with the bad are few. How do we prove that in themselves they are many? \"Many shall come from the East and from the West.\" Whither shall they come? To that feast, into which both good and bad enter. But speaking of another feast, He subjoined, \"and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-48-P4851_2079623:21-nf] That is the feast to which the bad shall not approach. Be that feast which now is, received worthily, that we may attain to the other. The same then are many, who are also few; in themselves many; in comparison with the bad few. Therefore what saith the Lord? He found one, and said, \"Let the many be cast out, the few remain.\" For to say, \"many are called, but few chosen,\" is nothing else than to show plainly who in this present feast are accounted to be such, as to be brought to that other feast, where no bad men shall come.","title":"Sermon XL.

Extend your love then, and limit it not to your wives and children. Such love is found even in beasts and sparrows. Ye know the sparrows and the swallows how they love their mates, how together they hatch their eggs, and nourish their young together, by a sort of free[fn-48-P4883_2095649:47-nf] and natural kindliness, and with no thought of a return. For the sparrow does not say, \"I will nourish my young, that when I am grown old, they may feed me.\" He has no such thought; he loves and feeds them, for the love of them; displays the affection of a parent, and looks for no return. And so, I know, I am sure, do ye love your children. \"For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.\"[fn-48-P4884_2096094:48-nf] Yea upon this plea it is that many of you excuse your covetousness, that ye are getting for your children, and are laying by for them.[fn-48-P4885_2096250:49-nf] But I say, extend your love, let this love grow; for to love wives and children, is not yet that \"wedding garment.\" Have faith to Godward. First love God. Extend yourselves out to God; and whomsoever ye shall be able, draw on to God. There is thine enemy: let him be drawn to God. There is a son, a wife, a servant; let them be all drawn to God. There is a stranger; let him be drawn to God. There is an enemy; let him be drawn to God. Draw, draw on thine enemy; by drawing him on he shall cease to be thine enemy. So let charity be advanced, so be it nourished, that being nourished it may be perfected; so be \"the wedding garment\" put on; so be the image of God, after which we were created, by this our advancing, engraven anew in us. For by sin was it bruised, and worn away. How is it bruised? how worn away? When it is rubbed against the earth? And what is, \"When it is rubbed against the earth \"? When it is worn by earthly lusts. For \"though man[fn-48-P4886_2097257:50-nf] walketh in this image, yet is he disquieted in vain.\"[fn-48-P4887_2097344:51-nf] Truth is looked for in God's image, not vanity.By the love of the truth then be that image, afterwhich we were created, engraven anew, and His Own tribute rendered to our Caesar. For so ye have heard from the Lord's answer, when the Jews tempted Him, as He said, \"Why tempt ye Me, ye hypocrites; show Me the tribute money,\"[fn-48-P4888_2097723:52-nf] that is, the impress and superscription of the image. Show me what ye pay, what ye get ready, what is exacted of you. And \"they showed Him a denarius;\" and \"He asked whose image and superscription it had.\" They answered, \"Caesar's.\" So Caesar looks for his own image. It is not Caesar's will that what he ordered to be made should be lost to him, and it is not surely God's will that what He hath made should be lost to Him. Caesar, my Brethren, did not make the money; the masters of the mint[fn-48-P4889_2098242:53-nf] make it; the workmen have their orders, he issues his commands to his ministers. His image was stamped upon the money; on the money was Caesar's image. And yet he requires what others have stamped; he puts it in his treasures; he will not have it refused him. Christ's coin is man. In him is Christ's image, in him Christ's Name, Christ's gifts, Christ's rules of duty.[fn-48-P4890_2098628:54-nf] ","title":"Sermon XL. [XC.

But I cannot approve of your conduct in writing after this threatening manner. Cease to write thus; adopt not the cause of Arius, nor listen to those in the East, nor give credit to Ursacius, Valens and their fellows. For whatever they assert, it is not on account of Athanasius, but for the sake of their own heresy. Believe my statement, O Constantius, who am of an age to be your grandfather. I was present at the Council of Sardica, when you and your brother Constans of blessed memory assembled us all together; and on my own account I challenged the enemies of Athanasius, when they came to the church where I abode[fn-49-P4930_1952349:8-nf] , that if they had anything against him they might declare it; desiring them to have confidence, and not to expect otherwise than that a right judgment would be passed in all things. This I did once and again, requesting them, if they were unwilling to appear before the whole Council, yet to appear before me alone; promising them also, that if he should be proved guilty, he should certainly be rejected by us; but if he should be found to be blameless, and should prove them to be calumniators, that if they should then refuse to hold communion with him, I would persuade him to go with me into the Spains. Athanasias was willing to comply with these conditions, and made no objection to my proposal; but they, altogether distrusting their cause, would not consent. And on another occasion Athanasius came to your Court[fn-49-P4931_1953212:9-nf] , when you wrote for him, and his enemies being at the time in Antioch, he requested that they might be summoned either altogether or separately, in order that they might either convict him, or be convicted[fn-49-P4932_1953433:10-nf] , and might either in his presence prove him to be what they represented, or cease to accuse him when absent. To this proposal also you would not listen, and they equally rejected it. Why then do you still give ear to them that speak evil of him? How can you endure Valens and Ursacius, although they have retracted and made a written confession of their calumnies[fn-49-P4933_1953819:11-nf] ? For it is not true, as they pretend, that they were forced to confess; there were no soldiers at hand to influence them; your brother was not cognizant of the matter[fn-49-P4934_1954006:12-nf] . No, such things were not done under his government, as are done now; God forbid. But they voluntarily went up to Rome, and in the presence of the Bishop and Presbyters wrote their recantation, having previously addressed to Athanasius a friendly and peaceable letter. And if they pretend that force was employed towards them, and acknowledge that this is an evil thing, which you also disapprove of; then do you cease to use force; write no letters, send no Counts; but release those that have been banished, lest while you are complaining of violence, they do but exercise greater violence. When was any such thing done by Constans? What Bishop suffered banishment? When did he appear as arbiter of an Ecclesiastical trial? When did any Palatine of his compel men to subscribe against any one, that Valens and his fellows should be able to affirm this? Cease these proceedings, I beseech you, and remember that you are a mortal man. Be afraid of the day of judgment, and keep yourself pure thereunto. Intrude not yourself into Ecclesiastical matters, neither give commands unto us concerning them; but learn them from us. God has put into your hands the kingdom; to us He has entrusted the affairs of His Church; and as he who would steal the empire from you would resist the ordinance of God, so likewise fear on your part lest by taking upon yourself the government of the Church, you become guilty of a great offence. It is written, \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's[fn-49-P4935_1955544:13-nf] .\" Neither therefore is it permitted unto us to exercise an earthly rule, nor have you, Sire, any authority to burn incense[fn-49-P4936_1955689:14-nf] . These things I write unto you out of a concern for your salvation. With regard to the subject of your letters, this is my determination; I will not unite myself to the Arians; I anathematize their heresy. Neither will I subscribe against, Athanasius, whom both we and the Church of the Romans and the whole Council pronounced to be guiltless. And yourself also, when you understood this, sent for the man, and gave him permission to return with honour to his country and his Church. What reason then can there be for so great a change in your conduct? The same persons who were his enemies before, are so now also; and the things they now whisper to his prejudice (for they do not declare them openly in his presence), the same they spoke against him, before you sent for him; the same they spread abroad concerning him when they come to the Council. And when I required them to come forward, as I have before said, they were unable to produce their proofs; had they possessed any, they would not have fled so disgracefully. Who then persuaded you so long after to forget your own letters and declarations? Forbear, and be not influenced by evil men, lest while you act for the mutual advantage of yourself and them, you render yourself responsible. For here you comply with their desires, hereafter in the judgment you will have to answer for doing so alone. These men desire by your means to injure their enemy, and wish to make you the minister of their wickedness, in order that through your help they may sow the seeds[fn-49-P4937_1957376:15-nf] of their accursed heresy in the Church. Now it is not a prudent thing to cast one's self into manifest danger for the pleasure of others. Cease then, I beseech you, O Constantius, and be persuaded by me. These things it becomes me to write, and you not to despise.'","title":"Part VI.","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":22,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_62_sermon_xlv_xcv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

What, brethren, does He promise believers? \"And ye shall know the truth.\" Why so? Had they not come to such knowledge when the Lord was speaking? If they had not, how did they believe? They believed, not because they knew, but that they might come to know. For we believe in order that we may know, we do not know in order that we may believe.

He was man, He was made in a low condition. He was seen by all, but not by all was He known. By many was He rejected, by the multitude was He slain, by few was He mourned; and yet even by those who mourned Him, His true being was still unrecognized. All this is the beginning as it were of faith's lineaments and future up-building. As the Lord, referring thereto, saith in a certain place, \"He that loveth me keepeth my commandments; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"[fn-17-P1712_1089387:15-nf] They certainly already saw the person to whom they were listening; and yet to them, if they loved Him, does He give it as a promise that they should see Him.

If you abide in that which is believed, you shall attain to that which is seen. Hence John himself, the holy evangelist, says in his epistle, \"Dearly beloved, we are the sons of God; but it is not yet apparent what we shall be.\" We are so already, and something we shall be. What more shall we be than we are?

Whose Son is He?\" Following their own opinion, they replied, \"Of David.\" For so they had read, and this only they retained; because while they read of His divinity, they did not understand it.

What doth it profit that the rest is fulfilled, if those are not fulfilled? Hast thou thirty-eight? If thou have not those two, the rest will profit thee nothing. Thou hast two short, without which the rest avail not, if thou have not the two commandments which conduct unto salvation. \"If I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

But only this latest generation of men, which has run its course from Tiberius onward, as you make it out,[fn-35-P3504_959137:239-nf] is to be saved: for it is Christ Himself that \"has re-deemed them from the curse of the law; \"[fn-35-P3505_959273:240-nf] as Paul, too, has given these further testimonies, that \"the letter killeth, and quickeneth no man,\"[fn-35-P3506_959395:241-nf] and that \"the law is the ministration of death,\"[fn-35-P3507_959490:242-nf] and \"the strength of sin.\"[fn-35-P3508_959539:243-nf] Archelaus said: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, neither the power of God.[fn-35-P3509_959640:244-nf] For many have also perished after the period of Christ's advent on to this present period, and many are still perishing,-those, to wit, who have not chosen to devote themselves to works of righteousness; whereas only those who have received Him, and yet receive Him, \"have obtained power to become the sons of God.\"[fn-35-P3510_959979:245-nf] For the evangelist has not said all have obtained that power; neither, on the other hand, however, has he put any limit on the time. But this is his expression: \"As many as received Him.\" Moreover, from the creation of the world He has ever been with righteous men, and has never ceased to require their blood at the hands of the wicked, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias.[fn-35-P3511_960396:246-nf] And whence, then, did righteous Abel and all those succeeding worthies,[fn-35-P3512_960491:247-nf] who are enrolled among the righteous, derive their righteousness when as yet there was no law of Moses, and when as vet the prophets had not arisen and discharged the functions of prophecy? Were they not constituted righteous in virtue of their fulfilling the law, \"every one of them showing the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing them witness? \"[fn-35-P3513_960947:248-nf] For when a man \"who has not the law does naturally the things contained in the law, he, not having the law, is a law unto himself.\"[fn-35-P3514_961099:249-nf] And consider now the multitude of laws thus existing among the several righteous men who lived a life of uprightness, at one time discovering for themselves the law of God implanted in their hearts, at another learning of it from their parents, and yet again being instructed in it further by the ancients and the elders. But inasmuch as dull, few were able to rise by this medium[fn-35-P3515_961500:250-nf] to the height of righteousness, that is to say, by means of the traditions of parents, when as yet there was no law embodied in writing, God had compassion on the race of man. and was pleased to give through Moses a written law to men, since verily the equity of the natural law filled to be retained in all its perfection in their hearts. In consonance, therefore, with man's first creation, a written legislation was prepared which was given through Moses in behoof of the salvation of very many. For if we reckon that man is justified without the works of the law, and if Abraham was counted righteous, how much more shall those obtain righteousness who have fulfilled the law which contains the things that are expedient for men? And seeing that you have made mention only of three several scriptures, in terms of which the apostle has declared that \"the law is a ministration of death,\"[fn-35-P3516_962494:251-nf] and that \"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law,\"[fn-35-P3517_962577:252-nf] and that \"the law is the strength of sin,\"[fn-35-P3518_962641:253-nf] you may now advance others of like tenor, and bring forward any passages which may seem to you to be written against the law, to any extent you please.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":42,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"ANF-06","text":"47. Then Manes, after silence had been secured among all, thus began his address: Like others, Archelaus, you too smite me with the most injurious words, notwithstanding that my sentiments on the subject of God are correct, and that I hold also a proper conception of Christ; and yet the family of the apostles is rather of the character that bears all things and endures all things, even although a man may assail them with revilings and curses. If it is your intention to persecute me, I am prepared for it: and if you wish to involve me in punishment, I shall not shrink from it; yea, if you mean even to put me to death, I am not afraid: \"For we ought to fear Him only who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\"[fn-38-P3849_1085852:562-nf] Archelaus said: Far be that from me! Not such is my intention. For what have you ever had to suffer at my hands, or at the hands of those who think with us, even when you were disparaging us and doing us injury, and when you were speaking in detraction of the traditions of our fathers, and when it was your aim to work the death of the souls of men that were well established in the truth, and that were kept with the most conscientious carefulness; for which, in truth, the whole wealth of the world would not sere as a sufficient compensation?[fn-38-P3850_1086419:563-nf] Nevertheless, what ground have you for assuming this position? What have you to show? Tell us this,-what signs of salvation have you to bring before us? For the bare bravado of words will not avail to satisfy the multitude here present, neither will it be enough to qualify them for recognising which of us holds the knowledge of the truth the more correctly. Wherefore, as you have got the opportunity of speaking first, tell us first to what particular head of the subject you wish us to direct the disputation. Manes said: If you do not offer a second time an unfair resistance to the positions which shall be stated with all due propriety by us, I shall speak with you; but if you mean to show yourself still in the character which on a former occasion I perceived you to take up, I shall address myself to Diodorus, and shall keep clear of your turbulence. Archelaus said: I have already expressed my opinion that we shall be simply abusing the occasion by the mere bandying of empty words. If any one on one side is formal to offer an unfair resistance, leave that to the decision of the judges. But now, tell us what you have got to advance. Manes said: If you do not mean a second time merely to gainsay the positions which are stated with all due correctness by me, I shall begin. Archelaus said: \"If not this,\" and \"if not that,\" are ways of speaking which mark out an ignorant man. You are ignorant, therefore, of what is in the future. But as to this particular thing which you do declare to be still future, to gainsay or not to gainsay is a matter in my own power. How, then, will that argument about the two trees stand, in which you place your trust as in a buckler of the most approved strength? For if I am of the contrary side, how do you require my obedience? And if, on the other hand, there is in me the disposition of obedience, how are you so greatly alarmed lest I should gainsay you? For you maintain that evil remains evil always, and that good remains good always, in utter ignorance of the force of your words. Manes said: Have I employed you as the advocate of my words, so that you may determine also the intelligence that may suit my knowledge? And how will you be able to explain what belongs to another person, when you cannot make what pertains to yourself clear? But if Diodorus now admits himself to be vanquished, my reasonings will then be addressed to you. If, however, he still stands out, and is prepared to speak, I beg you to give over and cease from interfering with the substantiating of the truth. For you are a strange sheep; nevertheless hereafter you will be introduced into the number of the same flock, as the voice of Jesus[fn-38-P3851_1089187:564-nf] also intimates,-that Jesus, namely, who appeared in the form of man indeed, and yet was not a man. Archelaus said: Are you not, then, of opinion that He was born of the Virgin Mary? Manes said: God forbid that I should admit that our Lord Jesus Christ came down to us through the natural womb of a woman! For He gives us His own testimony that He came down from the Father's bosom;[fn-38-P3852_1089673:565-nf] and again He says, \"He that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3853_1089773:566-nf] and. \"I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3854_1089867:567-nf] and once more, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-38-P3855_1089966:568-nf] And there are also innumerable other passages of a similar import, which point Him out as one that came, and not as one that was born. But if you are greater than He, and if you know better than He what is true, how do we yet believe Him? Archelaus said: Neither am I greater than He, for I am His servant nor can I be even the equal of my Lord, for I am His unprofitable servant; I am a disciple of His words, and I believe those things which have been spoken by Him, and I affirm that they are unchangeable. Manes said: A certain person somewhat like you once said to Him, \"Mary Thy mother, and Thy brethren, stand without; \"[fn-38-P3856_1090615:569-nf] and He took not the word kindly, but rebuked the person who had uttered it, saying, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"And He showed that those who did His will were both His mothers and His brethren. If you, however, mean to say that Mary was actually His mother, you place yourself in a position of considerable peril. For, without any doubt, it would be proved on the same principles that He had brethren also by her. Now tell me whether these brethren were begotten by Joseph or by the same Holy Spirit. For if you say that they were begotten by the same Holy Spirit, it will follow that we have had many Christs. And if you say that these were not begotten by the same Holy Spirit, and yet aver that He had brethren, then without doubt we shall be under the necessity of understanding that, in succession to the Spirit and after Gabriel, the most pure and spotless virgin[fn-38-P3857_1091524:570-nf] formed an actual marriage connection with Joseph. But if this is also a thing altogether absurd-I mean the supposition that she had any manner of intercourse with Joseph-tell me whether then He had brethren. Are you thus to fix the crime of adultery also on her, most sagacious Marcellus?[fn-38-P3858_1092182:571-nf] But if none of these suppositions suits the position of the Virgin undefiled, how will you make it out that He had brothers? And if you are unable to prove clearly to us that He had brethren, will it be any the easier for you to prove Mary to be His mother, in accordance with the saying of him who ventured to write,[fn-38-P3859_1092623:572-nf] \"Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without? \"Yet, although that man was bold enough to address Him thus, no one can be mightier or greater than this same person Himself who shows us His mother or His brethren. Nay, He does not deign even to hear it said that He is David's son.[fn-38-P3860_1092968:573-nf] The Apostle Peter, however, the most eminent of all the disciples, was able to acknowledge Him on that occasion, when all were putting forth the several opinions which they entertained respecting Him: for he said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; \"[fn-38-P3861_1093294:574-nf] and immediately He names him blessed, addressing him thus: \"For my heavenly Father hath revealed it unto thee.\" Observe what a difference there is between these two words which were spoken by Jesus. For to him who had said, \"Behold, Thy mother stands without,\" He replied, \"Who is my mother, or who are my brethren? \"But to him who said, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the living, God,\" He makes the return of a beatitude and benediction. Consequently, if you will have it that He was born of Mary, then it follows that no less than Peter, He is Himself thus proved to have spoken falsely. But if, on the other hand, Peter states what is true, then without doubt that former person was in error. And if the former was in error, the matter is to be referred back to the writer.[fn-38-P3862_1094095:575-nf] We know, therefore, that there is one Christ, according to the Apostle Paul, whose words, as in consonance at least[fn-38-P3863_1094348:576-nf] with His advent, we believe.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":39,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_56_homily_xii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-08","text":"\"But he is righteous who for the sake of what is reasoning fights with nature. For example, it is natural to all to love those who love them.

Wherefore also he refrains from doing wrong, and blesses those who curse him, pardons those who strike him, and submits to those who persecute him, and salutes those who do not salute him, shares such things as he has with those who have not, persuades him that is angry with him, conciliates his enemy, exhorts the disobedient, instructs the unbelieving, comforts the mourner; being distressed, be endures being ungratefully treated, he is not angry.

In the Gospel lesson which precedes this one, the Lord had said: \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you.\" On these word you remember that we have already discoursed, as the Lord enabled us. But here, that is, in the succeeding lesson which you have heard read, He says: \"These things I command you, that ye love one another.\" And thereby we are to understand that this is our fruit, of which He had said, \"I have chosen you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain.\" And what He subjoined, \"That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you,\" He will certainly give us if we love one another; seeing that this very thing He has also given us, in choosing us when we had no fruit, because we had chosen Him not; and appointing us that we should bring forth fruit,-that is, that we should love one another,-a fruit that we cannot have apart from Him, just as the branches can do nothing apart from the vine. Our fruit, therefore, is charity, which the apostle explains to be, \"Out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.\"[fn-29-P2998_1702227:1-nf] So love we one another, and so love we God. For it would be with no true love that we loved one another, if we loved not God. For every one loves his neighbor as himself if he loves God; and if he loves not God, he loves not himself. For on these two commandments of love hang all the law and the prophets:[fn-29-P2999_1702550:2-nf] this is our fruit. And it is in reference, therefore, to such fruit that He gives us commandment when He says, \"These things I command you, that ye love one another.\" In the same way also the Apostle Paul, when wishing to commend the fruit of the Spirit in opposition to the deeds of the flesh, posited this as his principle, saying, \"The fruit of the Spirit is love;\" and then, as if springing from and bound up in this principle, he wove the others together, which are \"joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\"[fn-30-P3000_1703119:3-nf] For who can truly rejoice who loves not good as the source of his joy? Who can have true peace, if he have it not with one whom he truly loves? Who can be long-enduring through persevering continuance in good, save through fervent love? Who can be kind, if he love not the person he is aiding? Who can be good, if he is not made so by loving? Who can be sound in the faith, without that faith which worketh by love? Whose meekness can be beneficial in character, if not regulated by love? And who will abstain from that which is debasing, if he love not that which dignifies? Appropriately, therefore, does the good Master so frequently commend love, as the only thing needing to be commended, without which all other good things can be of no avail, and which cannot be possessed without bringing with it those other good things that make a man truly good.","title":"Tractate LXXXVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_218_sermon_xc_on_the_fast_of_seventh_month_v_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"For there are two loves from which proceed all wishes, as different in quality as they are different in their sources. For the reasonable soul, which cannot exist without love, is the lover either of God or the world. In the love of God there is no excess, but in the love of the world all is hurtful. And therefore we must cling inseparably to eternal treasures, but things temporal we must use like passers-by, that as we are sojourners hastening to return to our own land, all the good things of this world which meet us may be as aids on the way, not snares to detain us. Therefore the blessed Apostle makes this proclamation, \"the time is short: it remains that those who have wives be as though they had none; and those who weep, as though they wept not; and those who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those who buy, as though they possessed not; and those that use this world, as though they used it not. For the fashion of this world passes away[fn-41-P4163_1067476:8-nf] .\" But as the world attracts us with its appearance, and abundance and variety, it is not easy to turn away from it unless in the beauty of things visible the Creator rather than the creature is loved; for, when He says, \"thou shale love the Lord Shy God from all thy heart, and from all thy mind, and from all shy strength[fn-41-P4164_1067822:9-nf] ,\" He wishes us in noticing to loosen ourselves from the bonds of His love. And when He links the love of our neighbour also to this command, He enjoins on us the imitation of His own goodness, that we should love what He loves and do what He does. For although we be \"God's husbandry and God's building,\" and \"neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase[fn-41-P4165_1068249:10-nf] ,\" yet in all things He requires our ministry and service, and wishes us to be the stewards of His gifts, that he who bears God's image may do God's will. For this reason, in the Lord's prayer we say most devoutly, \"Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done as in heaven, so also on earth.\" For what else do we ask for in these words but that God may subdue those whom He has not yet subdued, and as in heaven He makes the angels ministers of His will, so also on earth He may make men?

Happy the mind that craves this food and is eager for such drink: which it certainly would not seek for if it had never tasted of its sweetness. But hearing the Prophet's spirit saying to him: \"taste and see that the Lord is sweet[fn-42-P4236_1087499:22-nf] ;\" it has received some portion of sweetness from on high, and blazed out into love of the purest pleasure, so that spurning all things temporal, it is seized with the utmost eagerness for eating and drinking righteousness, and grasps the truth of that first commandment which says: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart, and out of all thy mind, and out of all thy strength[fn-42-P4237_1087969:23-nf] :\" since to love God is nothing else but to love righteousness[fn-42-P4238_1088194:24-nf] .

For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one man's obedience shall many be made righteous[fn-14-P1474_360996:7-nf] ;\" and again, \"For because by man (came) death, by man also (came) the resurrection of the dead.
