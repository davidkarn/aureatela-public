{"verses":["When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of\nking Herod, behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem,","Saying:  Where is he that is born king of the Jews?  For we have\nseen his star in the East, and are come to adore him.","And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with\nhim.","And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of\nthe people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.","But they said to him:  In Bethlehem of Juda.  For so it is written\nby the prophet:","And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the\nprinces of Juda:  for out of thee shall come forth the captain that\nshall rule my people Israel.","Then Herod, privately calling the wise men learned diligently of\nthem the time of the star which appeared to them;","And sending them into Bethlehem, said:  Go and diligently inquire\nafter the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that\nI also may come and adore him.","Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star\nwhich they had seen in the East, went before them, until it came and\nstood over where the child was.","And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.","And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his\nmother, and falling down they adored him:  and opening their treasures,\nthey offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.","And having received an answer in sleep that they should not\nreturn to Herod, they went back another way into their country.","And after they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord\nappeared in sleep to Joseph, saying:  Arise, and take the child and his\nmother, and fly into Egypt:  and be there until I shall tell thee.  For\nit will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him.","Who arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and\nretired into Egypt:  and he was there until the death of Herod:","That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet,\nsaying:  Out of Egypt have I called my son.","Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men, was\nexceeding angry:  and sending killed all the menchildren that were in\nBethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and\nunder, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the\nwise men.","Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet,\nsaying:","A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and great mourning; Rachel\nbewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are\nnot.","But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in\nsleep to Joseph in Egypt,","Saying:  Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the\nland of Israel.  For they are dead that sought the life of the child.","Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the\nland of Israel.","But hearing that Archclaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod\nhis father, he was afraid to go thither:  and being warned in sleep\nretired into the quarters of Galilee.","And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth:  that it might be\nfulfilled which was said by the prophets:  That he shall be called a\nNazarene."]}
