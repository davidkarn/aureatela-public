We read in Mark[fn-23-P2352_597290:1673-nf] of the Lord saying Talitha cumi and it is immediately added \"which is interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.\" The evangelist may he charged with falsehood for having added the words \"I say unto thee\" for the Hebrew is only \"Damsel arise.\" To emphasize this and to give the impression of one calling and commanding he has added \"I say unto thee.\" Again in Matthew[fn-23-P2353_597680:1674-nf] when the thirty pieces of silver are returned by the traitor Judas and the potter's field is purchased with them, it is written:-\"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken of by Jeremy the prophet, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued which[fn-23-P2354_598013:1675-nf] they of the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.\" This passage is not found in Jeremiah at all but in Zechariah, in quite different words and an altogether different order.

He would have them attain to a higher level than is commanded, and at the same time constantly remember that they are failing to perform their duty to God. This higher life is set before his whole audience as their aim. He recognises the peculiar honour of the widow and the virgin[fn-6-P613_408794:423-nf] , but has singularly little to say about these classes of the Christian community, or about the clergy, and no special counsel for them. The works of supererogation-the word is not his-which he preaches are within the reach of all Christians. They consist in the more perfect practice of the ordinary virtues. King David 'was not content henceforth to be confined to the express commands of the Law, nor to be subject to a mere necessity of obedience.' 'The Prophet prays that these free-will offerings may be acceptable to God, because the deeds done in compliance to the Law's edict are performed under the actual compulsion of servitude[fn-6-P614_409501:424-nf] . As an instance he gives the character of David. His duty was to be humble; he made himself humble exceedingly, thus doing more than he was legally bound to do. He spared his enemies so far as in him lay, and bewailed their death; this was a free service to which he was bound by no compulsion. Such conduct places those who practice it on the same level with those whose lives are formally consecrated; the state of the latter being regarded, as always in early times, as admirable in itself, and not as a means towards higher things. Vigils and fasts and acts of mercy are the methods advocated by Hilary for such attainment. But they must not stand alone, nor must the Christian put his trust in them. Humility must have faith for its principle, and fasting be combined with charity[fn-6-P615_410441:425-nf] And the Christian must never forget that though he may in some respects be doing more than he need, yet in others he is certainly falling short. For the conflict is unceasing; the devil, typified by the mountains in the Psalm, has been touched by God and is smoking, but is not yet burning and powerless for mischief[fn-6-P616_411504:426-nf] . Hence there is constant danger lest the Christian fall into unbelief or unfruitfulness, sins equally fatal[fn-6-P617_411643:427-nf] ; he must not trust in himself, either that he can deserve forgiveness for the past or resist future temptations[fn-6-P618_411775:428-nf] . Nor may he dismiss his past offences from his memory. It can never cease to be good for us to confess our former sins, even though we have become righteousSt. Paul did not allow himself to forget that he had persecuted the Church of God[fn-6-P619_412073:429-nf] . But there is a further need than that of penitence. Like Cyprian before him and Augustine after him, Hilary insists upon the value of alms in the sight of God. The clothing of the naked, the release of the captive plead with God for the remission of our sins[fn-6-P620_412355:430-nf] ; and the man who redeems his faults by alms is classed among those who win His favour, with the perfect in love and the blameless in faith[fn-6-P621_412514:431-nf] .","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":27,"verse":63,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_100_acts_of_the_holy_apostle_thomas","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-08","text":"And the apostle seeing this, said to them: Nothing strange or unusual has that demon shown, but his own nature, in which also he shall be burnt up; for the fire shall consume him, and the smoke of him shall be scattered abroad.

Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of sin is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-8-P842_326043:26-nf] Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,[fn-8-P843_326128:27-nf] yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: \"Put off the old man, and put on the new;\" which he goes on to explain by saying, \"Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.\"[fn-8-P844_326394:28-nf] But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaketh the truth from his heart may inhabit the holy hill of God?[fn-8-P845_326541:29-nf] But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the mystery of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the woman, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P846_326775:30-nf] with which mystery the apostle's words agree, where he says, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; set your thoughts[fn-8-P847_326988:31-nf] on things above.\"[fn-8-P848_327019:32-nf] For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the Father, means not to have thoughts[fn-8-P849_327135:33-nf] of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"10. Scripture again witnesses that the space of those three days themselves was not whole and entire, but the first day is counted as a whole from its last part, and the third day is itself also counted as a whole from its first part; but the intervening day, i.e. the second day, was absolutely a whole with its twenty-four hours, twelve of the day and twelve of the night. For He was crucified first by the voices of the Jews in the third hour, when it was the sixth day of the week. Then He hung on the cross itself at the sixth hour, and yielded up His spirit at the ninth hour.[fn-8-P876_336672:50-nf] But He was buried, \"now when the even was come,\" as the words of the evangelist express it;[fn-8-P877_336789:51-nf] which means, at the end of the day. Wheresoever then you begin,-even if some other explanation can be given, so as not to contradict the Gospel of John,[fn-8-P878_336963:52-nf] but to understand that He was suspended on the cross at the third hour,-still you cannot make the first day an entire day. It will be reckoned then an entire day from its last part, as the third from its first part. For the night up to the dawn, when the resurrection of the Lord was made known, belongs to the third day; because God (who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,[fn-8-P879_337368:53-nf] that through the grace of the New Testament and the partaking of the resurrection of Christ the words might be spoken to us \"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord\"[fn-8-P880_337578:54-nf] ) intimates to us in some way that the day takes its beginning from the night. For as the first days of all were reckoned from light to night, on account of the future fall of man;[fn-8-P881_337775:55-nf] so these on account of the restoration of man, are reckoned from darkness to light. From the hour, then, of His death to the dawn of the resurrection are forty hours, counting in also the ninth hour itself. And with this number agrees also His life upon earth of forty days after His resurrection. And this number is most frequently used in Scripture to express the mystery of perfection in the fourfold world. For the number ten has a certain perfection, and that multiplied by four makes forty. But from the evening of the burial to the dawn of the resurrection are thirty-six hours which is six squared. And this is referred to that ratio of the single to the double wherein there is the greatest consonance of co-adaptation. For twelve added to twenty-four suits the ratio of single added to double and makes thirty-six: namely a whole night with a whole day and a whole night, and this not without the mystery which I have noticed above. For not unfitly do we liken the spirit to the day and the body to the night. For the body of the Lord in His death and resurrection was a figure of our spirit and a type of our body. In this way, then, also that ratio of the single to the double is apparent in the thirty-six hours, when twelve are added to twenty-four. As to the reasons, indeed, why these numbers are so put in the Holy Scriptures, other people may trace out other reasons, either such that those which I have given are to be preferred to them, or such as are equally probable with mine, or even more probable than they are; but there is no one surely so foolish or so absurd as to contend that they are so put in the Scriptures for no purpose at all, and that there are no mystical reasons why those numbers are there mentioned. But those reasons which I have here given, I have either gathered from the authority of the church, according to the tradition of our forefathers, or from the testimony of the divine Scriptures, or from the nature itself of numbers and of similitudes. No sober person will decide against reason, no Christian against the Scriptures, no peaceable person against the church.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":56,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"2 They all with one consent pronounced Symeon,[fn-17-P1752_816432:132-nf] the son of Clopas, of whom the Gospel also makes mention;[fn-17-P1753_817613:133-nf] to be worthy of the episcopal throne of that parish.

On the assumption that there has been a mixture, he means that there is a distinction of terms as used both in the holy Gospels and in the apostolic writings. And he uses this language while glorifying himself that he is at war at once with Arius and Eunomius and the rest of the heresiarchs. Let then this exact professor of theology tells us how he would confute the blasphemy of the heretics, while applying to God the Word what is uttered humbly and appropriately by the form of the servant. They indeed while thus doing lay down that the Son of God is inferior, a creature, made, and a servant. To whom then are we, holding as we do the opposite opinion to theirs, and confessing the Son to be of one substance and co-eternal with God the Father, Creator of the Universe, Maker, Beautifier, Ruler, and Governor, All-wise, Almighty, or rather Himself, Power, Life and Wisdom, to refer the words \"My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me;\"[fn-8-P877_149828:186-nf] or \"Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me;\"[fn-8-P878_149909:187-nf] or \"Father save me from this hour;\"[fn-8-P879_149968:188-nf] or \"That hour no man knoweth, not even the Son of Man;\"[fn-8-P880_150045:189-nf] and all the other passages spoken and written in lowliness by Him and by the holy apostles about Him? To whom shall we apply the weariness and the sleep? To whom the ignorance and the fear? Who was it who stood in need of angelic succour? If these belong to God the Word, how was wisdom ignorant? How could it be called wisdom when affected by the sense of ignorance? How could He speak the truth in saying that He had all that the Father hath,[fn-8-P881_150595:190-nf] when not having the knowledge of the Father? For He says, \"The Father alone knoweth that day.\"[fn-8-P882_150711:191-nf] How could He be the unchanged image of Him that begat Him if He has not all that the Begetter hath? If then He speaks the truth when saying that He is ignorant, any one might suppose this of Him. But if He knoweth the day, but says that He is ignorant with the wish to hide it, you see in what a blasphemy the conclusion issues. For the truth lies and could not properly be called truth if it has any quality opposed to truth. But if the truth does not lie, neither is God the Word ignorant of the day which He Himself made, and which He Himself fixed, wherein He purposes to judge the world, but has the knowledge of the Father as being unchanged image. Not then to God the Word does the ignorance belong, but to the form of the servant who at that time knew as much as the indwelling Godhead revealed. The same position may be maintained about other similar cases. How for instance could it be reasonable for God the Word to say to the Father, \"Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt\"?[fn-8-P883_151779:192-nf] The absurdities which necessarily thence follow are not a few. First it follows that the Father and the Son are not of the same mind, and that the Father wishes one thing and the Son another, for He said, \"Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt.\" Secondly we shall have to contemplate great ignorance in the Son, for He will be found ignorant whether the cup can or cannot pass from Him; but to say this of God the Word is utter impiety and blasphemy. For exactly did He know the end of the mystery of the oeconomy Who for this very reason came among us, Who of His own accord took our nature, Who emptied Himself. For this cause too He foretold to the Holy Apostles, \"Behold we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed ...into the hands of the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and the third day He shall rise again.\"[fn-8-P884_152658:193-nf] How then can He Who foretold these things, and, when Peter deprecated their coming to pass, rebuked him, Himself deprecate their coming to pass, when He clearly knows all that is to be? Is it not absurd that Abraham many generations ago should have seen His day and have been glad,[fn-8-P885_152975:194-nf] and that Isaiah in like manner, and Jeremiah, and Daniel, and Zechariah, and all the fellowship of the prophets, should have foretold His saving passion, and He Himself be ignorant, and beg release from and deprecate it, though it was destined to come to pass for the salvation of the world? Therefore these words are not the words of God the Word, but of the form of the servant, afraid of death because death was not yet destroyed.[fn-8-P886_153431:195-nf] Surely God the Word permitted the utterance of these expressions allowing room for fear, that the nature of Him that had to be born may be plain, and to prevent our supposing the Son of Abraham and David to be an unreality or appearance. The crew of the impious heretics has given birth to this blasphemy through entertaining these sentiments. We shall therefore apply what is divinely spoken and acted to God the Word; on the other hand what is said and done in humility we shall connect with the form of a servant, lest we be tainted with the blasphemy of Arius and Eunomius.","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":27,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_10_homily_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"This Scripture,\" says he, \"must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before.\" Always he comforts them by the prophecies.

O thou blessed man, and in all things like to the Apostles, even in the reproaches which are thus heaped upon thee! Assuredly those Gentiles are reported to have entertained the same sort of thought respecting Paul also, when the viper had bitten him, for they said, \"This man must be a murderer, whom, although saved from the sea, the fates do not permit to live.\"[fn-3-P326_91388:2-nf] But he, shaking off the viper into the fire, suffered no harm. They, however, imagined that he would suddenly fall down, and speedily die; but whenthey saw that no harm befell him, changing theirminds, they said that he was a God. But, O thou most miserable of men, you ought, even from that example to have yourself been convinced of your falsity; so that, if it had proved a stumbling-block to thee that Martin appeared touched by the flame of fire, you should, on the other hand, have ascribed his being merely touched to his merits and power, because, though surrounded by flames, he did not perish. For acknowledge, thou miserable man, acknowledge what you seem ignorant of, that almost all the saints have been more remarkable for[fn-3-P327_92149:3-nf] the dangers they encountered, than even for the virtues they displayed. I see, indeed, Peter strong in faith, walking over the waves of the sea, in opposition to the nature of things, and that he pressed the unstable waters with his footprints. But not on that account does the preacher of the Gentiles[fn-3-P328_92471:4-nf] seem to me a smaller man, whom the waves swallowed up; and, after three days[fn-3-P329_92645:5-nf] and three nights, the water restored him emerging from the deep. Nay, I am almost inclined to think that it was a greater thing to have lived in the deep, than to have walked along the depths of the sea. But, thou foolish man, you had not, as I suppose, read these things; or, having read them, had not understood them. For the blessed Evangelist would not have recorded in holy writ an incident of that kind -under divine guidance-(except that, from such cases, the human mind might be instructed as to the dangers connected with shipwrecks and serpents!) and, as the Apostle relates, who gloried in his nakedness, and hunger, and perils from robbers, all these things are indeed to be endured in common by holy men, but that it has always been the chief excellence of the righteous in enduring and conquering such things, while amid all their trials, being patient and ever unconquerable, they overcame them all the more courageously, the heavier was the burden which they had to bear. Hence this event which is ascribed to the infirmity of Martin is, in reality, full of dignity and glory, since indeed, being tried by a most dangerous calamity, he came forth a conqueror. But let no one wonder that the incident referred to was omitted by me in that treatise which I wrote concerning his life, since in that very work I openly acknowledged that I had not embraced all his acts; and that for the good reason that, if I had been minded to narrate them all, I must have presented an enormous volume to my readers. And indeed, his achievements were not of so limited a number that they could all be comprehended in a book. Nevertheless, I shall not leave this incident, about which a question has arisen, to remain in obscurity, but shall relate the whole affair as it occurred, lest I should appear perchance to have intentionally passed over that which might be put forward in calumniation of the saintly man.","title":"Letter I.

I was therefore taken up into heaven, and I saw in the first heaven a great army of angels; and they took me to the judgments.

Then began I to say: Woe to sinners when they see one who is just more than the angels, and they themselves are in the Gehenna of fire! And Esdras said: Have mercy on the works of Thine hands, Thou who art compassionate, and of great mercy. Judge me rather than the souls of the sinners; for it is better that one soul should he punished, and that the whole world should not come to destruction. And God said: I will give rest in paradise to the righteous, and I have become[fn-84-P8454_2722247:4-nf] merciful.

But have mercy on the sinners, for we know that Thou art merciful. And God said: I do not see how I can have mercy upon them. And Esdras said: They cannot endure Thy wrath. And God said: This is the fate of such. And God said: I wish to have thee like Paul and John, as thou hast given me uncorrupted the treasure that cannot be stolen, the treasure of virginity, the bulwark[fn-84-P8455_2722909:5-nf] of men. And Esdras said: It is good for a man not to be born. It is good not to be in life. The irrational creatures are better than man, because they have no punishment; but Thou hast taken us, and given us up to judgment. Woe to the sinners in the world to come! because their judgment is endless, and the flame unquenchable. And while I was thus speaking to him, there came Michael and Gabriel, and all the apostles; and they said: Rejoice, O faithful man of God!

And the prophet said: I will not cease to plead with Thee, unless I see the day of the consummation. And God said:[fn-84-P8464_2726163:14-nf] Number the stars and the sand of the sea; and if thou shalt be able to number this, thou art also able to plead with me. And the prophet said: Lord, Thou knowest that I wear human flesh; and how can I count the stars of the heaven, and the sand of the sea? And God said: My chosen prophet, no man will know that great day and the appearing[fn-84-P8465_2726541:15-nf] that comes to judge the world.

Now He was speaking to the Jews; \"Them also,\" said He, \"must I bring, that there may be one fold, and One Shepherd.\"[fn-65-P6523_2749370:17-nf] Therefore there were two ships[fn-65-P6524_2749418:18-nf] out of which He had called His disciples. They figured these two people, when they let down their nets, and took up so great a draught[fn-65-P6525_2749569:19-nf] and so large a number of fishes, that the nets were almost broken. \"And they laded,\" it is said, \"both the ships.\" The two ships figured the One Church, but made out of two peoples, joined together in Christ, though coming from different parts. Of this too the two wives, who had one husband Jacob, Leah and Rachel, are a figure.[fn-65-P6526_2749909:20-nf] Of these two, the two blind men also are a figure, who sat by the way side, to whom the Lord gave sight.[fn-65-P6527_2750038:21-nf] And if ye pay attention to the Scriptures, ye will find the two Churches, which are not two but One, figured out in many places. For to this end the Corner-Stone serveth, for to make of two One. To this end serveth That Shepherd, for to make of two flocks One. So then the Lord who was to teach the Church, and to have a school of His Own beyond the Jews, as we see at present, would He be likely to send those who believe on Him unto the Jews, to learn? But under the name of the Scribes and Pharisees He intimated that there would be some in His Church who would say and not do; but, in the person of Moses He designated Himself. For Moses represented Him, and for this reason did he put a vail before him, when he was speaking to the people; because as long as they were in the law given up to carnal joys and pleasures, and looking for an earthly kingdom, a vail was put upon their face, that they should not see Christ in the Scriptures. For when the vail was taken away, after that the Lord had suffered, the secrets of the temple were discovered. Accordingly when He was hanging on the Cross, the vail of the temple was rent from the top even to the bottom;[fn-65-P6528_2751222:22-nf] and the Apostle Paul says expressly, \"But when thou shalt turn to Christ, the vail shall be taken away.\"[fn-65-P6529_2751349:23-nf] Whereas with him who turneth not to Christ, though he read the law of Moses, the vail is laid upon his heart, as the Apostle says. When the Lord then would signify beforehand that there would be some such in His Church, what did He say? \"The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. What they say, do; but do not what they do.\"[fn-65-P6530_2751699:24-nf] ","title":"Sermon LXXXVII. [CXXXVII.

And the meaning is: Who is he that cometh up from the earth, cometh up from blood? According to the[fn-71-P7131_2353827:97-nf] prophecy of Jacob, He has bound His foal to the vine, and has trodden the wine-press alone, and His garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is from flesh, or from the tribulation of the world: for He Himself[fn-71-P7132_2354063:98-nf] has conquered the world.

Then shall they see him who pierced Him, who shouted,[fn-71-P7139_2355395:105-nf] \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Again and again shall they beat their breasts, they and their women, those women to whom our Lord said, as He carried His cross,[fn-71-P7140_2355572:106-nf] \"Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\" Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of the angels, who said to the stupefied Apostles,[fn-71-P7141_2355776:107-nf] \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking with astonishment into heaven? This Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" But what are we to think of a man saying that our Lord[fn-71-P7142_2356031:108-nf] ate with the Apostles for forty days after His resurrection in order that they might not think Him to be a phantom, and then asserting that it was a phantom which did this very thing, which ate and which was seen by many in the flesh. That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":27,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_13_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"25.

The Father's voice from heaven says Hear Him. I hear Him saying, Father I thank Thee [fn-14-P1437_905380:24-nf] , and Say ye that I blasphemed, because l said, I am the Son of God[fn-14-P1438_905470:25-nf] ? If I may not believe these names, and assume that they mean what they assert, how am I to trust and to understand? No hint is given of an alternative meaning. The Father bears witness from heaven, This is My Son; the Son on His part speaks of My Father's house, and My Father. The confession of that name gives salvation, when faith is demanded in the question, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? The pronoun My indicates that the noun which follows belongs to the speaker. What right, I demand, have you heretics to suppose it otherwise? You contradict the Father's word the Son's assertion; you empty language of its meaning, and distort the words of God into a sense they cannot bear. On you alone rests the guilt of this shameless blasphemy, that God has lied concerning Himself.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":27,"verse":54,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_13_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"52. If this witness of the voyagers seem inconclusive to you because they were Apostles,-though to me it comes with the greater weight for the same reason, though it surprises me the less,-accept at any rate a corroboration given by the Gentiles. Hear how the soldier of the Roman cohort, one of the stern guard around the Cross, was humbled to the faith. The centurion sees the mighty workings of Christ's power; and this is the witness borne by him:-Truly this was the Son of God[fn-15-P1511_958088:71-nf] . The truth was forced upon him, after Christ had given up the ghost, by the torn veil of the Temple, and the earth that shook, and the rocks that were rent, and the sepulchres that were opened, and the dead that rose. And it was the confession of an unbeliever. The deeds that were done convinced him that Christ's nature was omnipotent; he names Him the Son of God, being assured of His true Divinity. So cogent was the proof, so strong the man's conviction, that the force of truth conquered his will, and even he who had nailed Christ to the Cross was driven to confess that He is the Lord of eternal glory, truly the Son of God.

Egypt bears witness, which received the Lord while yet young in the body[fn-12-P1259_337298:101-nf] : Symeon bears witness, who received Him in his arms, and said, Now, Lord, lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people[fn-12-P1260_337556:102-nf] . Anna also, the prophetess, a most devout widow, of austere life, bears witness of Him. John the Baptist bears witness, the greatest among the Prophets, and leader of the New Covenant, who in a manner united both Covenants in Himself, the Old and the New. Jordan is His witness among rivers; the sea of Tiberias among seas: blind and lame bear witness, and dead men raised to life, and devils saying, What have we to do with Thee, Jesus? we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy One of God[fn-12-P1261_338062:103-nf] .

The holy wood of the Cross bears witness, seen among us to this day, and from this place now almost filling the whole world, by means of those who in faith take portions from it[fn-12-P1262_338379:104-nf] . The palm-tree[fn-12-P1263_338612:105-nf] on the ravine bears witness, having supplied the palm-branches to the children who then hailed Him. Gethsemane[fn-12-P1264_338876:106-nf] bears witness, still to the thoughtful almost shewing Judas. Golgotha[fn-12-P1265_338974:107-nf] , the holy hill standing above us here, bears witness to our sight: the Holy Sepulchre bears witness, and the stone which lies there[fn-12-P1266_339183:108-nf] to this day. The sun now shining is His witness, which then at the time of His saving Passion was eclipsed[fn-12-P1267_340276:109-nf] : the darkness is His witness, which was then from the sixth hour to the ninth: the light bears witness, which shone forth from the ninth hour until evening.

His former enemies bear witness, of whom the blessed Paul is one, having been a little while His enemy, but for a long time His servant: the Twelve Apostles are His witnesses, having preached the truth not only in words, but also by their own torments and deaths: the shadow of Peter[fn-12-P1270_341384:112-nf] bears witness, having healed the sick in the name of Christ. The handkerchiefs and aprons bear witness, as in like manner by Christ's power they wrought cures of old through Paul[fn-12-P1271_341583:113-nf] . Persians[fn-12-P1272_341969:114-nf] and Goths[fn-12-P1273_342400:115-nf] , and all the Gentile converts bear witness, by dying for His sake, whom they never saw with eyes of flesh: the devils, who to this day[fn-12-P1274_342564:116-nf] are driven out by the faithful, bear witness to Him.","title":"Lecture X.","author":"Cyril"},{"chapter":27,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_11_tractate_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"11.

Again, the Apostle knows nothing in Christ about fear of pain. When He wishes to speak of the dispensation of the Passion, He includes it in the mystery of Christ's Divinity. Forgiving us all our trespasses, blotting out the band written in ordinances, that was against us, which was contrary to us: taking it away, and nailing it to the cross; stripping off from Himself His flesh, He made a shew of principalities and towers openly triumphing over them in Himself[fn-20-P2085_1347278:83-nf] . Was that the power, think you, to yield to the wound of the nail, to wince under the piercing blow, to convert itself into a nature that can feel pain? Yet the Apostle, who speaks as the mouthpiece of Christ[fn-20-P2086_1347509:84-nf] , relating the work of our salvation through the Lord, describes the death of Christ as `stripping off from Himself His flesh, boldly putting to shame the powers and triumphing over them in Himself.' If His passion was a necessity of nature and not the free gift of your salvation: if the cross was merely the suffering of wounds, and not the fixing upon Himself of the decree of death made out against you: if His dying was a violence done by death, and not the stripping off of the flesh by the power of God: lastly, if His death itself was anything but a dishonouring of powers, an act of boldness, a triumph: then ascribe to Him infirmity, because He was therein subject to necessity and nature, to force, to If ear and disgrace. But if it is the exact opposite in the mystery of the Passion, as it was preached to us, who, pray, can be so senseless as to repudiate the faith taught by the Apostles, to reverse all feelings of religion, to distort into the dishonourable charge of natural weakness, what was an act of free-will, a mystery, a display of power and boldness, a triumph? And what a triumph it was, when He offered Himself to those who sought to crucify Him, and they could not endure His presence: when He stood under sentence of death, Who shortly was to sit on the right hand of power: when He prayed for His persecutors while the nails were driven through Him: when He completed the mystery as He drained the draught of vinegar; when He was numbered among the transgressors and meanwhile granted Paradise: that when He was lifted on the tree, the earth quaked: when He hung on the cross, sun and day were put to flight: that He left His own body, yet cubed life back to the bodies of others[fn-20-P2087_1349241:85-nf] : was buffed a corpse and rose again God: as man suffered all weaknesses for our sakes, as God triumphed in them all.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":27,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"49.

Some there were who said, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-36-P3643_1397870:42-nf] and, \"There is no rest in my bones, by reason of my sins;\"[fn-36-P3644_1397945:43-nf] and, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;\"[fn-36-P3645_1398053:44-nf] and, \"Stablish me with Thy directing Spirit;\"[fn-36-P3646_1398116:45-nf] and, \"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\"[fn-36-P3647_1398174:46-nf] There were some, again, who said: \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\"[fn-36-P3648_1398264:47-nf] For they too were cleansed with the self-same faith with which we ourselves are. Whence the apostle also says: \"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believe, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-36-P3649_1398538:48-nf] Out of very faith was it said, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,\"[fn-36-P3650_1398678:49-nf] \"which is, being interpreted, God with us.\"[fn-36-P3651_1398741:50-nf] Out of very faith too was it said concerning Him: \"As a bridegroom He cometh out of His chamber; as a giant did He exult to run His course. His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and His circuit runs to the other end of heaven; and no one is hidden from His heat.\"[fn-36-P3652_1399034:51-nf] Out of very faith, again, was it said to Him: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.\"[fn-36-P3653_1399339:52-nf] By the self-same Spirit of faith were all these things foreseen by them as to happen, whereby they are believed by us as having happened. They, indeed, who were able in faithful love to foretell these things to us were not themselves partakers of them. The Apostle Peter says, \"Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.\"[fn-36-P3654_1399849:53-nf] Now on what principle does he make this statement, if it be not because even they were saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and not the law of Moses, from which comes not the cure, but only the knowledge of sin?[fn-36-P3655_1400097:54-nf] Now, however, the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.[fn-36-P3656_1400231:55-nf] If, therefore, it is now manifested, it even then existed, but it was hidden. This concealment was symbolized by the veil of the temple. When Christ was dying, this veil was rent asunder,[fn-36-P3657_1400438:56-nf] to signify the full revelation of Him. Even of old, therefore there existed amongst the people of God this grace of the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; but like the rain in the fleece which God sets apart for His inheritance,[fn-36-P3658_1400710:57-nf] not of debt, but of His own will, it was latently present, but is now patently visible amongst all nations as its \"floor,\" the fleece being dry,-in other Words, the Jewish people having become reprobate.[fn-36-P3659_1400934:58-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"3.

For nothing has been done without a meaning. Our fathers who have written comments have given another reason of this matter. For since in the Gospels the power of salutary Baptism is twofold, one which is granted by means of water to the illuminated, and a second to holy martyrs, in persecutions, through their own blood, there came out of that saving Side blood and water[fn-17-P1715_476088:93-nf] , to confirm the grace of the confession made for Christ, whether in baptism, or on occasions of martyrdom.

How then did Jonas, who was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, escape corruption? And, seeing that the nature of all men is such that we cannot live without breathing, as we do, in air, how did he live without a breath of this air for three days?

Does then the Lord grant life to His own servant, by sending His power with him, and can He not grant it to Himself as well? If that is credible, this is credible also; if this is incredible, that also is incredible. For to me both are alike worthy of credence.

Furthermore this is plainly taught by the divine Scripture, for so the holy Matthew narrates the event, \"When the even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus' disciple: he went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered, and when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.\"[fn-47-P4776_1177426:62-nf] See how often he mentions the body in order to stop the mouths of them who blaspheme the Godhead. The same course is pursued by the thrice blessed Mark, whose narrative I will also quote. \"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. And Pilate marvelled if He were already dead; and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph, and he brought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre,\"[fn-47-P4777_1178202:63-nf] and so on. Observe with admiration, the harmony of terms, and how consistently and continuously the word body is introduced. The illustrious Luke, too, relates just in the same way how Joseph begged the body and after he had received it treated it with due rites.[fn-47-P4778_1178487:64-nf] By the divine John we are told yet more, \"Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pound weight. Then took they the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at band.\"[fn-47-P4779_1179270:65-nf] Observe how often mention is made of the body; how the Evangelist shows that it was the body which was nailed to the cross, the body begged by Joseph of Pilate, the body taken down from the tree, the body wrapped in linen clothes with the myrrh and aloes, and then the name of the person given to it; and Jesus said to have been laid in a tomb. Thus the angel said, \"Come see the place where the Lord lay,\"[fn-47-P4780_1179699:66-nf] naming the part by the name of the whole; and we constantly do just the same. In this place, we say, such an one was buried; not the body of such an one. Every one in his senses knows that we are speaking of the body, and such a mode of speech is customary in divine Scripture. Aaron, we read, died and they buried him on Mount Hor.[fn-47-P4781_1180054:67-nf] Samuel died and they buried him at Ramah,[fn-47-P4782_1180113:68-nf] and there are many similar instances. The same use is followed by the divine Apostle when speaking of the death of the Lord. \"I delivered unto you first of all,\" he writes, \"that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-47-P4783_1180489:69-nf] and so on.","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":27,"verse":50,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_19_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"83.

Now, that we may not linger too long on the point, (I would challenge you to) assert the other reasons also, that you may condemn the Judge's sentences; extenuate the delinquencies of the sinner, that you may blame his judicial conviction. Never mind censuring the Judge; rather prove Him to be an unjust one. Well, then, even though[fn-45-P4501_1453325:184-nf] He required the sins of the fathers at the hands of the children, the hardness of the people made such remedial measures necessary[fn-45-P4502_1453474:185-nf] for them, in order that, having their posterity in view, they might obey the divine law.

Again, if the blessing of the fathers was destined likewise for their offspring, previous to[fn-45-P4503_1453757:186-nf] any merit on the part of these, why might not the guilt of the fathers also redound to their children? As was the grace, so was the offence; so that the grace and the offence equally ran down through the whole race, with the reservation, indeed, of that subsequent ordinance by which it became possible to refrain from saying, that \"the fathers had eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth were set on edge: \"[fn-45-P4504_1454190:187-nf] in other words, that the father should not bear the iniquity of the son, nor the son the iniquity of the father, but that every man should be chargeable with his own sin; so that the harshness of the law having been reduced[fn-45-P4505_1454436:188-nf] after the hardness of the people, justice was no longer to judge the race, but individuals.

For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no doubt have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, \"The righteous one did they sell for silver.\"[fn-69-P6952_2022008:1595-nf] The very amount and the destination[fn-69-P6953_2022066:1596-nf] of the money, which on Judas' remorse was recalled from its first purpose of a fee,[fn-69-P6954_2022167:1597-nf] and appropriated to the purchase of a potter's field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah:[fn-69-P6955_2022313:1598-nf] \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued[fn-69-P6956_2023536:1599-nf] and gave them for the potter's field.\" When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it His own feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, \"This is my body,\"[fn-69-P6957_2024134:1600-nf] that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body.[fn-69-P6958_2024319:1601-nf] An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say, ) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of Marcion's theory of a phantom body,[fn-69-P6959_2024703:1602-nf] that bread should have been crucified!But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon,[fn-69-P6960_2024876:1603-nf] which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: \"I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that[fn-69-P6961_2025229:1604-nf] they devised a device against me, saying, Let us cast the tree upon His bread,\"[fn-69-P6962_2025396:1605-nf] which means, of course, the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the ancient prophecies,[fn-69-P6963_2025681:1606-nf] He declared plainly enough what He meant by the bread, when He called the bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the new testament to be sealed \"in His blood,\"[fn-69-P6964_2026008:1607-nf] affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, \"Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might?

Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,[fn-69-P6966_2027407:1609-nf] saying, \"He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes\"[fn-69-P6967_2027506:1610-nf] -in His garments and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine.

Accordingly, of all the festal days of the Jews He chose the passover.[fn-69-P6944_2020517:1587-nf] In this Moses had declared that there was a sacred mystery:[fn-69-P6945_2020600:1588-nf] \"It is the Lord's passover.\"[fn-69-P6946_2020651:1589-nf] How earnestly, therefore, does He manifest the bent of His soul: \"With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.\"[fn-69-P6947_2020816:1590-nf] What a destroyer of the law was this, who actually longed to keep its passover! Could it be that He was so fond of Jewish lamb?[fn-69-P6948_2020969:1591-nf] But was it not because He had to be \"led like a lamb to the slaughter; and because, as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so was He not to open His mouth,\"[fn-69-P6949_2021232:1592-nf] that He so profoundly wished to accomplish the symbol of His own redeeming blood? He might also have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that even here too He fulfilled a Psalm: \"He who did eat bread with me hath lifted up[fn-69-P6950_2021488:1593-nf] his heel against me.\"[fn-69-P6951_2021561:1594-nf] And without a price might He have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no doubt have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, \"The righteous one did they sell for silver.\"[fn-69-P6952_2022008:1595-nf] The very amount and the destination[fn-69-P6953_2022066:1596-nf] of the money, which on Judas' remorse was recalled from its first purpose of a fee,[fn-69-P6954_2022167:1597-nf] and appropriated to the purchase of a potter's field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah:[fn-69-P6955_2022313:1598-nf] \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued[fn-69-P6956_2023536:1599-nf] and gave them for the potter's field.\" When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it His own feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, \"This is my body,\"[fn-69-P6957_2024134:1600-nf] that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body.[fn-69-P6958_2024319:1601-nf] An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say, ) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of Marcion's theory of a phantom body,[fn-69-P6959_2024703:1602-nf] that bread should have been crucified!But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon,[fn-69-P6960_2024876:1603-nf] which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: \"I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that[fn-69-P6961_2025229:1604-nf] they devised a device against me, saying, Let us cast the tree upon His bread,\"[fn-69-P6962_2025396:1605-nf] which means, of course, the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the ancient prophecies,[fn-69-P6963_2025681:1606-nf] He declared plainly enough what He meant by the bread, when He called the bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the new testament to be sealed \"in His blood,\"[fn-69-P6964_2026008:1607-nf] affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, \"Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might?

And many other things blasphemously spake they against Him. And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief priests, and the scribes came together, and led Him into their council, saying, Art thou the Christ? tell us. And He said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe; and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And He said unto them, Ye say that I am. And they said, What need we further witness? For we ourselves have heard of His own mouth. And the whole multitude of them arose, and led Him unto Pilate.\"[fn-23-P2386_1020174:107-nf] Luke has thus recorded all these things. His statement contains certain facts which are also related by Matthew and Mark; namely, that the Lord was asked whether He was the Son of God, and that He made this reply, \"I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\" And we gather that these things took place when the day was now breaking, because Luke's expression is, \"And as soon as it was day.\" Thus Luke's narrative is similar to those of the others, although he also introduces something which these others have left unnoticed. We gather further, that when it was yet night, the Lord faced the ordeal of the false witnesses,-a fact which is recorded briefly by Matthew and Mark, and which is passed over in silence by Luke, who, however, has told the story of what was done when the dawn was coming in. The former two-namely, Matthew and Mark-have given connected narratives of all that the Lord passed through until early morning. After that, however, they have reverted to the story of Peter's denial; on the conclusion of which they have come back upon the events of the early morning, and have introduced the other circumstances which remained for recital with a view to the completion of their account of what befell the Lord.[fn-23-P2387_1021709:108-nf] But up to this point they have given no account of the occurrences belonging specifically to the morning.[fn-23-P2388_1021973:109-nf] In like manner John, after recording what was done with the Lord as fully as he deemed requisite, and after telling also the whole story of Peter's denial, continues his narrative in these terms: \"Then lead they Jesus to Caiaphas,[fn-23-P2389_1022263:110-nf] unto the hall of judgment. And it was early.\"[fn-23-P2390_1022349:111-nf] Here we might suppose either that there had been something imperatively requiring Caiaphas' presence in the hall of judgment, and that he was absent on the occasion when the other chief priests held an inquiry on the Lord; or else that the hall of judgment was in his house; and that yet from the beginning of this scene they had thus only been leading Jesus away to the personage in whose presence He was at last actually conducted. But as they brought the accused person in the character of one already convicted, and as it had previously approved itself to Caiaphas' judgment that Jesus should die, there was no further delay in delivering Him over to Pilate, with a view to His being put to death.[fn-23-P2391_1023074:112-nf] And thus it is that Matthew here relates what took place between Pilate and the Lord.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"28.

And they said, What is that to us? See thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was valued, whom the children of Israel[fn-23-P2393_1024467:113-nf] did value, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.\"[fn-23-P2394_1024640:114-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"32.

And He answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? For he knew that for envy they had delivered Him. But when he was set down on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. But the governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas. Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified. The governor said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. Then released he Barabbas unto them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to them to be crucified.\"[fn-24-P2407_1037466:121-nf] These are the things which Matthew has reported to have been done to the Lord by Pilate.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"36. We have now reached the point at which we may study the Lord's passion, strictly so called, as it is presented in the narrative of these four evangelists. Matthew commences his account as follows: \"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto Him the whole band of soldiers. And they stripped Him, and put on Him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head, and a reed in His right hand: and they bowed the knee before Him, and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!\"[fn-24-P2432_1055045:140-nf] At the same stage in the narrative, Mark delivers himself thus: \"And the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium; and they called together the whole band. And they clothed Him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and began to salute Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote Him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon Him, and, bowing their knees, worshipped Him.\"[fn-24-P2433_1055497:141-nf] Here, therefore, we perceive that while Matthew tells us how they \"put on Him a scarlet robe,\" Mark speaks of purple, with which He was clothed. The explanation may be that the said scarlet robe was employed instead of the royal purple by these scoffers. There is also a certain red-coloured purple which resembles scarlet very closely. And it may also be the case that Mark has noticed the purple which the robe contained, although it was properly scarlet. Luke has left this without mention. On the other hand, previous to stating how Pilate delivered Him up to be crucified, John has introduced the following passage: \"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged Him. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote Him with their hands.\"[fn-24-P2434_1056369:142-nf] This makes it evident that Matthew and Mark have reported this incident in the way of a recapitulation, and that it did not actually take place after Pilate had delivered Him up to be crucified. For John informs us distinctly enough that these things took place when He yet was with Pilate. Hence we conclude that the other evangelists have introduced the occurrence at that particular point, just because, having previously passed it by, they recollected it there. This is also borne out by what Matthew proceeds next to relate. He continues thus: \"And they spit upon Him, and took the reed, and smote Him on the head. And after that they had mocked Him, they took the robe off from Him, and put His own raiment on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.\"[fn-24-P2435_1057146:143-nf] Here we are given to understand that the taking the robe off Him and the clothing Him with His own raiment were done at the close, when He was being led away. This is given by Mark, as follows: \"And when they had mocked Him. they took off the purple from Him, and put His own clothes on Him.\"[fn-24-P2436_1057467:144-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"36. We have now reached the point at which we may study the Lord's passion, strictly so called, as it is presented in the narrative of these four evangelists. Matthew commences his account as follows: \"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto Him the whole band of soldiers. And they stripped Him, and put on Him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head, and a reed in His right hand: and they bowed the knee before Him, and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!\"[fn-24-P2432_1055045:140-nf] At the same stage in the narrative, Mark delivers himself thus: \"And the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium; and they called together the whole band. And they clothed Him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and began to salute Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote Him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon Him, and, bowing their knees, worshipped Him.\"[fn-24-P2433_1055497:141-nf] Here, therefore, we perceive that while Matthew tells us how they \"put on Him a scarlet robe,\" Mark speaks of purple, with which He was clothed. The explanation may be that the said scarlet robe was employed instead of the royal purple by these scoffers. There is also a certain red-coloured purple which resembles scarlet very closely. And it may also be the case that Mark has noticed the purple which the robe contained, although it was properly scarlet. Luke has left this without mention. On the other hand, previous to stating how Pilate delivered Him up to be crucified, John has introduced the following passage: \"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged Him. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote Him with their hands.\"[fn-24-P2434_1056369:142-nf] This makes it evident that Matthew and Mark have reported this incident in the way of a recapitulation, and that it did not actually take place after Pilate had delivered Him up to be crucified.

And they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His cross.\"[fn-24-P2441_1058153:146-nf] Luke's version is also to this effect: \"And as they led Him away, they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country; and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.\"[fn-24-P2442_1058381:147-nf] On the other hand, John records the matter as follows: \"And they took Jesus, and led Him away. And He bearing His cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha; where they crucified Him.\"[fn-24-P2443_1058813:148-nf] From all this we understand that Jesus was carrying the cross Himself as He went forth into the place mentioned. But on the way the said Simon, who is named by the other three evangelists, was pressed into the service, and got the cross to carry for the rest of the course until the spot was reached.

First, then, let us consider what the hour really is at which He can have been crucified; and then we shall see how it happens that Mark has reported Him to have been crucified at the third hour. Now it was about the sixth hour when Pilate, who was sitting, as has been stated, at the time upon the judgment-seat, delivered Him up to be crucified. The expression is not that it was the sixth hour fully, but only that it was about the sixth hour; that is to say, the fifth hour was entirely gone, and so much of the sixth hour had also been entered upon.

Again, if any one affirms his ability to prove it not to have been the third hour when the Jews cried out in the terms in question, because, after Mark's statement to this effect, \"And Pilate answered, and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? And they cried out again, Crucify him,\" we find no further details introduced into the narrative of the same evangelist, but are led on at once to the statement, that the Lord was delivered up by Pilate to be crucified-an act which John mentions to have taken place about the sixth hour;-I repeat, if any one adduces such an argument, let him understand that many things have been passed by without record here, which occurred in the interval when Pilate was engaged in looking out for some means by which he could rescue Jesus from the Jews, and was exerting himself most strenuously by every means in his power to withstand their maddened desires. For Matthew says, \"Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do, then, with Jesus, which is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.\" Then we affirm it to have been the third hour. And when the same Matthew goes on to add the sentence, \"But when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made,\" we understand that a period of two hours had passed, during the attempts made by Pilate to effect the release of Jesus, and the tumults raised by the Jews in their efforts to defeat him, and that the sixth hour had then commenced, previous to the close of which those things took place which are related as happening between the time when Pilate delivered up the Lord and the oncoming of the darkness.

Matthew continues his narrative in these terms: \"The robbers also, which were crucified with Him, cast the same in His teeth.\"[fn-25-P2523_1095766:200-nf] Mark is quite in harmony with Matthew here, giving the same statement in different words.[fn-25-P2524_1095880:201-nf] On the other hand, Luke may be thought to contradict this, unless we be careful not to forget a certain mode of speech which is sufficiently familiar. For Luke's narrative runs thus: \"And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on Him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.\"[fn-25-P2525_1096193:202-nf] And then the same writer proceeds to introduce into the same context the following recital: \"But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, To-day thou shall be with me in paradise.\"[fn-25-P2526_1096695:203-nf] The question then is, how we can reconcile either Matthew's report, \"The robbers also, which were crucified with Him, cast the same in His teeth,\" or Mark's, namely, \"And they that were crucified with Him reviled Him,\" with Luke's testimony, which is to the effect that one of them reviled Christ, but that the other arrested him and believed on the Lord. The explanation will be, that Matthew and Mark, presenting a concise version of the passage under review, have employed the plural number instead of the singular; as is the case in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where we find the statement given in the plural form, that \"they stopped the mouths of lions,\"[fn-25-P2527_1097381:204-nf] while Daniel alone is understood to be referred to. Again, the plural number is adopted where it is said that they \"were sawn asunder,\"[fn-25-P2528_1097537:205-nf] while that manner of death is reported only of Isaiah. In the same way, when it is said in the Psalm, \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took counsel together,\" etc.,[fn-25-P2529_1097744:206-nf] the plural number is employed instead of the singular, according to the exposition given of the passage in the Acts of the Apostles. For those who have made use of the testimony of the said Psalm in that book take the kings to refer to Herod, and the princes to Pilate.[fn-25-P2530_1098032:207-nf] But further, inasmuch as the pagans are in the habit of bringing such slanderous charges against the Gospel, I would ask them to consider how their own writers have spoken of Phaedras and Medeas and Clytemnestras, when there really was but a single individual reputed trader each of these names. And what is more common, for example, than for a person to say, \"The rustics also behave insolently to me,\" even although it should only be one that acted rudely? In short, no real discrepancy would be created by the restriction of Luke's report to one of the two robbers, unless the other evangelists had declared expressly that \"both\" the malefactors reviled the Lord; for in that case it would not be possible for us to suppose only one individual intended under the plural number. Seeing, however, that the phrase employed is \"the robbers,\" or \"those who were crucified with Him,\" and the term \"both\" is not added, the expression is one which might have been used if both these men had been engaged in the thing, but which might equally well be adopted if one of the two had been implicated in it,-that fact being then conveyed by the use of the plural number, according to a familiar method of speech.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"54. Matthew proceeds in the following terms: \"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.\"[fn-25-P2534_1099484:208-nf] The same fact is attested by two others of the evangelists.[fn-25-P2535_1099568:209-nf] Luke adds, however, a statement of the cause of the darkness, namely, that \"the sun was darkened.\" Again, Matthew continues thus: \"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani! that is to say, My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\"[fn-25-P2536_1099985:210-nf] Mark's agreement with this is almost complete, so far as regards the words, and not only almost, but altogether complete, so far as the sense is concerned. Matthew next makes this statement: \"And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.\"[fn-25-P2537_1100331:211-nf] Mark presents it in a similar form: \"And one ran, and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take Him down.\"[fn-25-P2538_1100560:212-nf] Matthew, however, has represented these words about Elias to have been spoken, not by the person who offered the sponge with the vinegar, but by the rest. For his version runs thus: \"But the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elias will come to save Him;\"[fn-25-P2539_1100839:213-nf] -from which, therefore, we infer that both the man specially referred to and the others who were there expressed themselves in these terms. Luke, again, has introduced this notice of the vinegar previous to his report of the robber's insolence. He gives it thus: \"And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him, and offering Him vinegar, and saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself.\"[fn-25-P2540_1101262:214-nf] It has been Luke's purpose to embrace in one statement what was done and what was said by the soldiers.

But John has stated a fact which is noticed by none of the other three, namely, that He said \"It is finished,\" after He had received the vinegar. This cry we take to have been uttered previous to the loud voice referred to.

For the precise succession appears to be this, namely, that He said first \"It is finished,\" when what had been prophesied regarding Him was fulfilled in Him, and that thereafter-as if He had been waiting for this, like one, indeed, who died when He willed it to be so-He commended His spirit [to His Father], and resigned it.[fn-25-P2551_1104736:222-nf] But, whatever the order may be in which a person may consider it likely that these words were spoken, he ought above all things to guard against entertaining the notion that any one of the evangelists is in antagonism with another, when one leaves unmentioned something which another has repeated, or particularizes something which another has passed by in silence.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":51,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"56.

For, with the intention of attaching miracle to miracle, he has told us first how \"the sun was darkened,\" and then has deemed it right to subjoin the said sentence in immediate succession, namely, \"And the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.\" Thus it would appear that he has introduced at an earlier point this incident, which really took place when the Lord expired, so as to give us there a summary description of the circumstances relating to the drinking of the vinegar, and the loud voice, and the death itself, which are understood to have taken place previous to the rending of the veil, and after the darkness had come in. For Matthew has inserted this sentence, \"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent,\" in immediate succession to the statement, \"And Jesus, crying again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost;\" and has thus given us clearly to understand that the time when the veil was rent was after Jesus had given up His spirit. If, however, he had not added the words, \"And behold,\" but had said simply, \"And the veil of the temple was rent,\" it would have been uncertain whether Mark and he had narrated the incident in the form of a recapitulation, while Luke had kept the exact order, or whether Luke had given the summary account of what these others had introduced in the correct historical succession.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":51,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"57.

But this involves no discrepancy. For as the said Matthew not only tells us how the centurion \"saw the earthquake,\" but also appends the words, \"and those things that were done,\" he has indicated that there was room enough for Luke to represent the Lord's death as itself the thing which called forth the centurion's wonder. For that event is also one of the things which were done in so marvellous a manner then. At the same time, even although Matthew had not added any such statement, it would still have been perfectly legitimate to suppose, that as many astonishing things did take place at that time, and as the centurion and those who were with him may well have looked upon them all with amazement, the historians were at liberty to select for narration any particular incident which they were severally disposed to instance as the subject of the man's wonder. And it would not be fair to impeach them with inconsistency, simply because one of them may have specified one occurrence as the immediate cause of the centurion's amazement, while another introduces a different incident. For all these events together had really been matters for the man's astonishment. Again, the mere fact that one evangelist tells us that the centurion said, \"Truly this was the Son of God,\" while another informs us that the words were, \"Truly this man was the Son of God,\" will create no difficulty to any one who has retained some recollection of the numerous statements and discussions bearing upon similar cases, which have already been given above. For these different versions of the words both convey precisely the same sense and although one writer introduces the wore \"man\" while another does not, that implies no kind of contradiction. A greater appearance of discrepancy may be supposed to be created by the circumstance, that the words which Luke reports the centurion to have uttered are not \"This was the Son of God,\" but \"This was a righteous man.\" But we ought to suppose either that both things were actually said by the centurion, and that two of the evangelists have recorded the one expression, and the third the other; or else perhaps that it was Luke's intention to bring out the exact idea which the centurion had in view when he said that Jesus was the Son of God. For it may be the case that the centurion did not really understand Him to be the Only-begotten, equal with the Father; but that he called Him the Son of God simply because he believed Him to be a righteous man, as many righteous men have been named sons of God.

For in what way can the truth be affected by the fact that some of these women are named in both lists, while others are referred to only in the one? Luke has likewise connected his narrations as follows: \"And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. And all His acquaintance and the women that followed Him from Galilee stood afar off beholding these things.\"[fn-25-P2570_1113565:232-nf] Here we perceive that he is quite in harmony with the former two as far as regards the presence of the women, although he does not mention any of them by name. On the subject of the multitude of people who were also present, and who, as they beheld the things which were done, smote their breasts and returned, he is in like manner at one with Matthew, although that evangelist has introduced into the context this distinct statement: \"Now the centurion and they that were with him.\" Thus it simply appears that Luke is the only one who has spoken expressly of His \"acquaintance\" who stood afar off. For John has also noticed the presence of the women before the Lord gave up the ghost. His narrative runs thus: \"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple standing by whom He loved, He saith unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith He to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.\"[fn-25-P2571_1114669:233-nf] Now, as regards this statement, had not Matthew and Mark at the same time mentioned Mary Magdalene most explicitly by name, it might have been possible for us to say that there was one company of women afar off, and another near the cross. For none of these writers has mentioned the Lord's mother here but John himself. The question, therefore, which rises now is this, How can we understand the same Mary Magdalene both to have stood afar off along with other women, as the accounts of Matthew and Mark bear, and to have been by the cross, as John tells us, unless it be the case that these women were at such a distance as made it quite legitimate to say at once that they were near, because they were at hand there in the sight of Him, and also afar off in comparison with the crowd of people who were standing round about in closer vicinity along with the centurion and the soldiers? It is open for us, then, to suppose that those women who were present at the scene along with the Lord's mother, after He commended her to the disciple, began then to retire with the view of extricating themselves from the dense mass of people, and of looking on at what remained to be done from a greater distance. And in this way the rest of the evangelists, who have introduced their notices of these women only after the Lord's death, have properly reported them to be standing by that time afar off.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":57,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"59.

This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.\"[fn-25-P2578_1117587:237-nf] John, on the other hand, first narrates the breaking of the legs of those who had been crucified with the Lord, and the piercing of the Lord's side with the lance (which whole passage has been recorded by him alone), and then subjoins a statement which is of the same tenor with what is given by the other evangelists. It proceeds in these terms: \"And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.\"[fn-25-P2579_1118194:238-nf] There is nothing here to give any one of them the appearance of being in antagonism with another. But some one may perhaps ask whether John is not inconsistent with himself, when he at once unites with the rest in telling us how Joseph begged the body of Jesus, and comes forward as the only one who states here that Joseph had been a disciple of Jesus secretly for fear of the Jews. For the question may reasonably be raised as to how it happened that the man who had been a disciple secretly for fear had the courage to beg His body-a thing which not one of those who were His open followers was bold enough to do. We must understand, however, that this man did so in the confidence which his dignified position gave him, the possession of which rendered it possible for him to make his way on familiar terms into Pilate's presence. And we must suppose, further, that in the performance of that last service relating to the interment, he cared less for the Jews, however he tried in ordinary circumstances, when hearing the Lord, to avoid exposing himself to their enmity.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":59,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"60. Matthew proceeds thus: \"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.\"[fn-25-P2583_1119666:239-nf] Mark's version is as follows: \"And he bought fine linen,[fn-25-P2584_1119751:240-nf] and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.\"[fn-25-P2585_1120106:241-nf] Luke reports it in those terms: \"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.\"[fn-25-P2586_1120292:242-nf] So far as these three narratives are concerned, no allegation of a want of harmony can possibly be raised. John, however, tells us that the burial of the Lord was attended to not only by Joseph, but also by Nicodemus. For he begins with Nicodemus in due connection with what precedes, and goes on with his narrative as follows: \"And there came also Nicodemus (which at the first came to Jesus by night), and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.\"[fn-25-P2587_1120793:243-nf] Then, introducing Joseph again at this point, he continues in these terms: \"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.\"[fn-25-P2588_1121246:244-nf] But there is really as little ground for supposing any discrepancy here as there was in the former case, if we take a correct view of the statement. For those evangelists who have left Nicodemus unnoticed have not affirmed that the Lord was buried by Joseph alone, although he is the only one introduced into their records. Neither does the fact, that these three are all at one in informing us how the Lord was wrapped in the linen cloth by Joseph, preclude us from entertaining the idea that other linen stuffs may have been brought by Nicodemus, and added to what was given by Joseph, so that John may be perfectly correct in his narrative, especially as what he tells us is that the Lord was wrapped not in a linen cloth, but in linen clothes.[fn-25-P2589_1122018:245-nf] At the same time, when we take into account the handkerchief which was used for the head, and the bandages with which the whole body was swathed, and consider that all these were made of linen, we can see how, even although there was really but a single linen cloth [of the kind referred to by the first three evangelists] there, it could still have been stated with the most perfect truth that \"they wound Him in linen clothes.\" For the phrase, linen clothes, is one applied generally to all textures made of flax.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":61,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"61.

As for example, Judas having entered into the temptation of the love of money, swam not through it, but was overwhelmed and was strangled[fn-29-P2945_841889:36-nf] both in body and spirit. Peter entered into the temptation of the denial; but having entered, he was not overwhelmed by it, but manfully swam through it, and was delivered from the temptation[fn-29-P2946_842126:37-nf] . Listen again, in another place, to a company of unscathed saints, giving thanks for deliverance from temptation, Thou, O God hast prayed us; Thou hast tried us by, fire like as silver is tried. Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst afflictions upon our loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water; and thou broughtest us out into a place of rest[fn-29-P2947_842588:38-nf] . Thou seest them speaking boldly in regard to their having passed through and not been pierced[fn-29-P2948_842706:39-nf] . But Thou broughtest us out into a place of rest; now their coming into a place of rest is their being delivered from temptation.","title":"Lecture XXIII.","author":"Cyril"},{"chapter":27,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"84. In Tamar, then, the daughter-in-law of Judah, we see the people of the kingdom of Judah, whose kings, answering to Tamar's husbands, were taken from this tribe. Tamar means bitterness; and the meaning is suitable, for this people gave the cup of gall to the Lord.[fn-22-P2255_1361517:153-nf] The two sons of Judah represent two classes of kings who governed ill-those who did harm and those who did no good. One of these sons was evil or cruel before the Lord; the other spilled the seed on the ground that Tamar might not become a mother. There are only those two kinds of useless people in the world-the injurious and those who will not give the good they have but lose it or spill it on the ground. And as injury is worse than not doing good, the evil-doer is called the elder and the other the younger. Er, the name of the elder, means a preparer of skins, which were the coats given to our first parents when they were punished with expulsion from paradise.[fn-22-P2256_1362212:154-nf] Onan, the name of the younger, means, their grief; that is, the grief of those to whom he does no good, wasting the good he has on the earth. The loss of life implied in the name of the elder is a greater evil than the want of help implied in the name of the younger. Both being killed by God typifies the removal of the kingdom from men of this character. The meaning of the third son of Judah not being joined to the woman, is that for a time the kings of Judah were not of that tribe. So this third son did not become the husband of Tamar; as Tamar represents the tribe of Judah, which continued to exist, although the people received no king from it. Hence the name of this son, Selom, means, his dismission. None of those types apply to the holy and righteous men who, like David, though they lived in those times, belong properly to the New Testament, which they served by their enlightened predictions. Again, in the time when Judah ceased to have a king of its own tribe, the elder Herod does not count as one of the kings typified by the husbands of Tamar; for he was a foreigner, and his union with the people was never consecrated with the holy oil. His was the power of a stranger, given him by the Romans and by Caesar. And it was the same with his sons, the tetrarchs, one of whom, called Herod, like his father, agreed with Pilate at the time of the Lord's passion.[fn-22-P2257_1363614:155-nf] So plainly were these foreigners considered as distinct from the sacred monarchy of Judah, that the Jews themselves, when raging against Christ, exclaimed openly, \"We have no king but Caesar.\"[fn-22-P2258_1363830:156-nf] Nor was Caesar properly their king, except in the sense that all the world was subject to Rome.

But we must not speak in a mere cursory way of the partition and dividing by lot of His garments. For although all the four evangelists make mention thereof, yet the others do so more briefly than John: and their notice of it is obscure, while his is in the plainest manner possible. For Matthew says, \"And after they crucified Him, they parted His garments, casting lots.\"[fn-37-P3749_2064267:1-nf] Mark: \"And they crucified Him, and parted His garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.\"[fn-37-P3750_2064396:2-nf] Luke: \"And they parted His raiment, and cast lots.\"[fn-37-P3751_2064464:3-nf] But John has told us also how many parts they made of His garments, namely, four, that they might take one part apiece. From which it, is apparent that there were four soldiers, who obeyed the governor's orders in crucifying Him. For he plainly says: \"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Him, took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and likewise the coat,\" where there is understood, they took: so that the meaning is, they took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and they took also His coat. And he so spake, that we might see that there was no lot cast on His other garments; but His coat, whichthey took along with the others, they did not similarly divide. For in regard to it he proceeds to explain, \"Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.\" And then telling us why they cast lots on it, he says, \"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.\" Hence it is clear that in the case of the other garments they had equal parts, so that there was no need to cast lots: but that as regards this one, they could not have had a part each without rending it, and thereby possessing themselves only of useless fragments of it; to prevent which, they preferred letting it come to one of them by lot. The account given by this evangelist is also in harmony with the testimony of prophecy, which he likewise immediately subjoins, saying, \"That the scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.\" For He says not, they cast lots, but \"they parted:\" nor does He say, casting lots they parted; but while making no mention whatever of the lot in regard to the rest of the garments, He afterwards said, \"and for my vesture they did cast lots,\" in reference solely to the coat that remained. On which I shall speak as He Himself enables me, after I have first refuted the calumny, which may possibly arise, as if the evangelists disagreed with one another, by showing that the words of none of the others are inconsistent with the narrative of John.","title":"Tractate CXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_124_tractate_cxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. Nor need we be disturbed with the question, how the sponge could be applied to His mouth when He was lifted up from the earth on the cross.

By the reed, however, the scripture was signified, which was fulfilled by this very act. For as a tongue is called either Greek or Latin, or any other, significant of the sound, which is uttered by the tongue; so the reed may give its name to the letter which is written with a reed. We most usually, however, call those tongues that express the sounds of the human voice: while in calling scripture a reed, the very rareness of the thing only enhances the mystical nature of that which it symbolizes.

Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had been done.[fn-106-P10624_2984308:199-nf] For as it was on our account and for our learning that these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done-(even ours, I say), \"upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-106-P10625_2984562:200-nf] In this way it was that even then He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as He always did to take upon Him man's actual component substances, body and soul, making inquiry of Adam (as if He were ignorant),[fn-106-P10626_2984825:201-nf] \"Where art thou, Adam? \"[fn-106-P10627_2984907:202-nf] -repenting that He had made man, as if He had lacked foresight;[fn-106-P10628_2984991:203-nf] tempting Abraham, as if ignorant of what was in man; offended with persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other (weaknesses and imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as unworthy of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that these circumstances are suitable enough for the Son, who was one day to experience even human sufferings-hunger and thirst, and tears, and actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation \"made by the Father a little less than the angels.\"[fn-106-P10629_2985547:204-nf] But the heretics, you may be sure, will not allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God, which you are imputing to the very Father Himself, when you pretend[fn-106-P10630_2985740:205-nf] that He made Himself less (than the angels) on our account; whereas the Scripture informs us that He who was made less was so affected by another, and not Himself by Himself.

Surely even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary's womb, and set Him before Pilate's judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men. and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: \"The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor be hungry; \"[fn-106-P10637_2988074:212-nf] much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really done by Him through the agency of the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":27,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-03","text":"What follows Philip's question, and the Lord's whole treatment of it, to the end of John's Gospel, continues to furnish us with statements of the same kind, distinguishing the Father and the Son, with the properties of each. Then there is the Paraclete or Comforter, also, which He promises to pray for to the Father, and to send from heaven after He had ascended to the Father. He is called \"another Comforter,\" indeed;[fn-107-P10797_3029721:345-nf] but in what way He is another we have already shown,[fn-107-P10798_3029795:346-nf] \"He shall receive of mine,\" says Christ,[fn-107-P10799_3029863:347-nf] just as Christ Himself received of the Father's. Thus the connection of the Father in the Son, and of the Son in the Paraclete, produces three coherent Persons, who are yet distinct One from Another. These Three are, one[fn-108-P10800_3030105:348-nf] essence, not one Person,[fn-108-P10801_3030189:349-nf] as it is said, \"I and my Father are One,\"[fn-108-P10802_3030244:350-nf] in respect of unity of substance not singularity of number. Run through the whole Gospel, and you will find that He whom you believe to be the Father (described as acting for the Father, although you, for your part, forsooth, suppose that \"the Father, being the husbandman,\"[fn-108-P10803_3030538:351-nf] must surely have been on earth) is once more recognised by the Son as in heaven, when, \"lifting up His eyes thereto,\"[fn-108-P10804_3030675:352-nf] He commended His disciples to the safe-keeping of the Father.[fn-108-P10805_3030758:353-nf] We have, moreover, in that other Gospel a clear revelation, i.e. of the Son's distinction from the Father, \"My God, why hast Thou forsaken me? \"[fn-108-P10806_3030925:354-nf] and again, (in the third Gospel, ) \"Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\"[fn-108-P10807_3031030:355-nf] But even if (we had not these passages, we meet with satisfactory evidence) after His resurrection and glorious victory over death. Now that all the restraint of His humiliation is taken away, He might, if possible, have shown Himself as the Father to so faithful a woman (as Mary Magdalene) when she approached to touch Him, out of love, not from curiosity, nor with Thomas' incredulity. But not so; Jesus saith unto her, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren\" (and even in this He proves Himself to be the Son; for if He had been the Father, He would have called them His children, (instead of His brethren), \"and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.\"[fn-108-P10808_3031793:356-nf] Now, does this mean, I ascend as the Father to the Father, and as God to God? Or as the Son to the Father, and as the Word to God? Wherefore also does this Gospel, at its very termination, intimate that these things were ever written, if it be not, to use its own words, \"that ye might believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God? \"[fn-108-P10809_3032146:357-nf] Whenever, therefore, you take any of the statements of this Gospel, and apply them to demonstrate the identity of the Father and the Son, supposing that they serve your views therein, you are contending against the definite purpose of the Gospel.

I will not here largely use the support of the other Gospels, which confirm our belief by the Lord's nativity: it is sufficient to remark that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by the angel himself as the Son of God: \"The Spirit of God shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10814_3033851:359-nf] On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth will prevail. Of course, they say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate[fn-108-P10815_3034077:360-nf] what, if it had been true, would have been written. Whom was he[fn-108-P10816_3034156:361-nf] so afraid of as not plainly to declare, \"God shall come upon thee, and the Highest shall overshadow thee? \"Now, by saying \"the Spirit of God\" (although the Spirit of God is God, ) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion[fn-108-P10817_3034435:362-nf] of the whole Godhead to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of \"the Son.\" The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same as the Word. For just as, when John says, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-108-P10818_3034811:363-nf] we understand the Spirit also in the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit, and the Two are One (and the same).[fn-108-P10819_3035093:364-nf] Now John must mean One when he speaks of Him as \"having been made flesh,\" and the angel Another when he announces Him as \"about to be born,\" if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of God is not actually He whose Word He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not actually He whose Spirit He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a personal subject,[fn-108-P10820_3035989:365-nf] and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of God, although He is an actually existing thing,[fn-108-P10821_3036396:366-nf] yet He cannot be God Himself[fn-108-P10822_3036449:367-nf] (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will \"the power of the Highest\" not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing thing, as being Spirit-in the same way as the wisdom (of God) and the providence (of God) is not God: these attributes are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance. Power is incidental to the Spirit, but cannot itself be the Spirit. These things, therefore, whatsoever they are-(I mean) the Spirit of God, and the Word and the Power-having been conferred on the Virgin, that which is born of her is the Son of God. This He Himself, in those other Gospels also, testifies Himself to have been from His very boyhood: \"Wist ye not,\" says He, \"that I must be about my Father's business? \"[fn-108-P10823_3037397:368-nf] Satan likewise knew Him to be this in his temptations: \"Since Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10824_3037505:369-nf] This, accordingly, the devils also acknowledge Him to be: \"we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10825_3037637:370-nf] His \"Father\" He Himself adores.[fn-108-P10826_3037704:371-nf] When acknowledged by Peter as the \"Christ (the Son) of God,\"[fn-108-P10827_3037815:372-nf] He does not deny the relation. He exults in spirit when He says to the Father, \"I thank Thee, O Father, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent.\"[fn-108-P10828_3038004:373-nf] He, moreover, affirms also that to no man is the Father known, but to His Son;[fn-108-P10829_3038104:374-nf] and promises that, as the Son of the Father, He will confess those who confess Him, and deny those who deny Him, before His Father.[fn-108-P10830_3038269:375-nf] He also introduces a parable of the mission to the vineyard of the Son (not the Father), who was sent after so many servants,[fn-108-P10831_3038419:376-nf] and slain by the husbandmen, and avenged by the Father. He is also ignorant of the last day and hour, which is known to the Father only.[fn-108-P10832_3038582:377-nf] He awards the kingdom to His disciples, as He says it had been appointed to Himself by the Father.[fn-108-P10833_3038704:378-nf] He has power to ask, if He will, legions of angels from the Father for His help.[fn-108-P10834_3038807:379-nf] He exclaims that God had forsaken Him.[fn-108-P10835_3038869:380-nf] He commends His spirit into the hands of the Father.[fn-108-P10836_3038946:381-nf] After His resurrection He promises in a pledge to His disciples that He will send them the promise of His Father;[fn-108-P10837_3039083:382-nf] and lastly, He commands them to baptize into the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, not into a unipersonal God.[fn-108-P10838_3039221:383-nf] And indeed it is not once only, but three times, that we are immersed into the Three Persons, at each several mention of Their names.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":27,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself, so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about that?

But this was the voice of flesh and soul, that is to say, of man-not of the Word and Spirit, that is to say, not of God; and it was uttered so as to prove the impassibility of God, who \"forsook\" His Son, so far as He handed over His human substance to the suffering of death. This verity the apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: \"If the Father spa. red not His own Son.\"[fn-108-P10888_3059054:421-nf] This did Isaiah before him likewise perceive, when he declared: \"And the Lord hath delivered Him up for our offences.\"[fn-108-P10889_3059195:422-nf] In this manner He \"forsook\" Him, in not sparing Him; \"forsook\" Him, in delivering Him up.

And such a one indeed as, \"with the heart believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth maketh confession unto salvation,\"[fn-80-P8045_1719198:166-nf] arid bears testimony to the works of Christ, as making confession by all these things of Christ before men, will be confessed by Him before His Father in heaven.[fn-80-P8046_1719379:167-nf] So also he who has not denied himself but denied the Christ will experience the saying, \"I also will deny him.\"[fn-80-P8047_1719511:168-nf] On this account let every thought and every purpose and every word and every action become a denial of ourselves, but a testimony about Christ and in Christ; for I am persuaded that every action of the perfect man is a testimony to Christ Jesus, and that abstinence from every sin is a denial of self, leading him after Christ. And such an one is crucified with Christ, and taking up his own cross follows Him who for our sakes bears His own cross, according to that which is said in John: \"They took Jesus therefore and put it on Him,\" etc., down to the words, \"Where they crucified Him.\"[fn-80-P8048_1720121:169-nf] But the Jesus according to John, so to speak, bears the cross for Himself, and bearing it went out; but the Jesus according to Matthew and Mark and Luke, does not bear it for Himself, for Simon of Cyrene bears it.[fn-80-P8049_1720360:170-nf] And perhaps this man refers to us, who because of Jesus take up the cross of Jesus, but Jesus Himself takes it upon Himself; for there are, as it were, two conceptions of the cross, the one which Simon of Cyrene bears, and the other which Jesus Himself bears for Himself.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":27,"verse":52,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But after these things it is written that, when they heard the voice from the cloud bearing testimony to the Son, the three Apostles, not being able to bear the glory of the voice and power resting upon it, \"fell on their face,\"[fn-82-P8200_1764679:264-nf] and besought God; for they were sore afraid at the supernatural sight, and the things which were spoken from the sight.

Wherefore since His being glorified in the resurrection was akin to His transfiguration, and to the vision of His face as the sun, on this account He wishes that these things should then be spoken of by the Apostles, when He rose from the dead.

But let any one who so listeth still refuse his assent, and declare that what John asserts is true enough, that the Lord said not that that disciple dieth not, and yet that this is the meaning of such words as He is here recorded to have used; and further assert that the Apostle John is still living, and maintain that he is sleeping rather than lying dead in his tomb at Ephesus. Let him employ as an argument the current report that there the earth is in sensible commotion, and presents a kind of heaving appearance, and assert whether it be steadfastly or obstinately that this is occasioned by his breathing. For we cannot fail to have some who so believe, if there is no want of those also who affirm that Moses is alive; because it is written that his sepulchre could not be found,[fn-38-P3898_2149035:3-nf] and that he appeared with the Lord on the mountain along with Elias,[fn-38-P3899_2149123:4-nf] of whom we read that he did not die, but was translated.[fn-39-P3900_2149198:5-nf] As if Moses' body could not have been hid somewhere in such a way as that its position should altogether escape discovery by men, and be raised up therefrom by divine power at the time when Elias and he were seen with Christ just as at the time of Christ's passion many bodies of the saints arose, and after His resurrection appeared, according to Scripture, to many in the holy city.[fn-39-P3901_2149602:6-nf] But still, as I began to say, if some deny the death of Moses, whom Scripture itself, in the very passage where we read that his sepulchre could nowhere be found, explicitly declares to have died; how much more may occasion be taken from these words where the Lord says, \"Thus do I wish him to stay till I come,\" to believe that John is sleeping, but still alive, beneath the ground? Of whom we have also the tradition (which is found in certain apocryphal scriptures), that he was present, in good health, when he ordered a sepulchre to be made for him; and that, when it was dug and prepared with all possible care, he laid himself down there as in a bed, and became immediately defunct: yet as those think who so understand these words of the Lord, not really defunct, but only lying like one in such a condition; and, while accounted dead, was actually buried when asleep, and that he will so remain till the coming of Christ, making known meanwhile the fact of his life by the bubbling up of the dust, which is believed to be forced by the breath of the sleeper to ascend from the depths to the surface of the grave. I think it quite superfluous to contend with such an opinion. For those may see for themselves who know the locality whether the ground there does or suffers what is said regarding it, because, in truth, we too have heard of it from those who are not altogether unreliable witnesses.","title":"Tractate CXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":63,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-04","text":"4. With respect to the thoughts which proceed from our heart, or the recollection of things which we have done, or the contemplation of any things or causes whatever, we find that they sometimes proceed from ourselves, and sometimes are originated by the opposing powers; not seldom also are they suggested by God, or by the holy angels. Now such a statement will perhaps appear incredible,[fn-71-P7137_1571976:286-nf] unless it be confirmed by the testimony of holy Scripture, That, then, thoughts arise within ourselves, David testifies in the Psalms, saying, \"The thought of a man will make confession to Thee, and the rest of the thought shall observe to Thee a festival day.\"[fn-71-P7138_1572256:287-nf] That this, however, is also brought about by the opposing powers, is shown by Solomon in the book of Ecclesiastes in the following manner: \"If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for soundness restrains great offences.\"[fn-71-P7139_1572638:288-nf] The Apostle Paul also will bear testimony to the same point in the words: \"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of Christ.\"[fn-71-P7140_1572857:289-nf] That it is an effect due to God, nevertheless, is declared by David, when he says in the Psalms, \"Blessed is the man whose help is in Thee, O Lord, Thy ascents (are) in his heart.\"[fn-71-P7141_1573058:290-nf] And the apostle says that \"God put it into the heart of Titus.\"[fn-71-P7142_1573480:291-nf] That certain thoughts are suggested to men's hearts either by good or evil angels, is shown both by the angel that accompanied Tobias,[fn-71-P7143_1573639:292-nf] and by the language of the prophet, where he says, \"And the angel who spoke in me answered.\"[fn-71-P7144_1573777:293-nf] The book of the Shepherd[fn-71-P7145_1573933:294-nf] declares the same, saying that each individual is attended by two angels; that whenever good thoughts arise in our hearts, they are suggested by the good angel; but when of a contrary kind, they are the instigation of the evil angel. The same is declared by Barnabas in his Epistle,[fn-71-P7146_1574279:295-nf] where he says there are two ways, one of light and one of darkness, over which he asserts that certain angels are placed;-the angels of God over the way of light, the angels of Satan over the way of darkness. We are not, however, to imagine that any other result follows from what is suggested to our heart, whether good or bad, save a (mental) commotion only, and an incitement instigating us either to good or evil. For it is quite within our reach, when a malignant power has begun to incite us to evil, to cast away from us the wicked suggestions, and to resist the vile inducements, and to do nothing that is at all deserving of blame. And, on the other hand, it is possible, when a divine power calls us to better things, not to obey the call; our freedom of will being preserved to us in either case. We said, indeed, in the foregoing pages, that certain recollections of good or evil actions were suggested to us either by the act of divine providence or by the opposing powers, as is shown in the book of Esther, when Artaxerxes had not remembered the services of that just man Mordecai, but, when wearied out with his nightly vigils, had it put into his mind by God to require that the annals of his great deeds should be read to him; whereon, being reminded of the benefits received from Mordecai, he ordered his enemy Haman to be hanged, but splendid honours to be conferred on him, and impunity from the threatened danger to be granted to the whole of the holy nation. On the other hand, however, we must suppose that it was through the hostile influence of the devil that the suggestion was introduced into the minds of the high priests and the scribes which they made to Pilate, when they came and said, \"Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.\"[fn-71-P7147_1576156:296-nf] The design of Judas, also, respecting the betrayal of our Lord and Saviour, did not originate in the wickedness of his mind alone. For Scripture testifies that the \"devil had already put it into his heart to betray Him.\"[fn-71-P7148_1576401:297-nf] And therefore Solomon rightly commanded, saying, \"Keep thy heart with all diligence.\"[fn-71-P7149_1576508:298-nf] And the Apostle Paul warns us: \"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.\"[fn-71-P7150_1576684:299-nf] And when he says, \"Neither give place to the devil,\"[fn-71-P7151_1576756:300-nf] he shows by that injunction that it is through certain acts, or a kind of mental slothfulness, that room is made for the devil, so that, if he once enter our heart, he will either gain possession of us, or at least will pollute the soul, if he has not obtained the entire mastery over it, by casting on us his fiery darts; and by these we are sometimes deeply wounded, and sometimes only set on fire. Seldom indeed, and only in a few instances, are these fiery darts quenched, so as not to find a place where they may wound, i.e., when one is covered by the strong and mighty shield of faith. The declaration, indeed, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,\"[fn-71-P7152_1577608:301-nf] must be so understood as if \"we\" meant, \"I Paul, and you Ephesians, and all who have not to wrestle against flesh and blood: \"for such have to struggle against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, not like the Corinthians, whose struggle was as yet against flesh and blood, and who had been overtaken by no temptation but such as is common to man.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":27,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§9.

For if the flowers were made especially for man, and senseless people have taken them not for their own proper and grateful use, but have abused them to the thankless service of demons, we must keep from them for conscience sake. The crown is the symbol of untroubled tranquillity. For this reason they crown the dead, and idols, too, on the same account, by this fact giving testimony to their being dead. For revellers do not without crowns celebrate their orgies; and when once they are encircled with flowers, at last they are inflamed excessively. We must have no communion with demons. Nor must we crown the living image of God after the manner of dead idols. For the fair crown of amaranth is laid up for those who have lived well. This flower the earth is not able to bear; heaven alone is competent to produce it.[fn-39-P3996_1226226:168-nf] Further, it were irrational in us, who have heard that the Lord was crowned with thorns,[fn-39-P3997_1226442:169-nf] to crown ourselves with flowers, insulting thus the sacred passion of the Lord. For the Lord's crown prophetically pointed to us, who once were barren, but are placed around Him through the Church of which He is the Head. But it is also a type of faith, of life in respect of the substance of the wood, of joy in respect of the appellation of crown, of danger in respect of the thorn, for there is no approaching to the Word without blood. But this platted crown fades, and the plait of perversity is untied, and the flower withers. For the glory of those who have not believed on the Lord fades. And they crowned Jesus raised aloft, testifying to their own ignorance. For being hard of heart, they understood not that this very thing, which they called the disgrace of the Lord, was a prophecy wisely uttered: \"The Lord was not known by the people \"[fn-39-P3998_1227317:170-nf] which erred, which was not circumcised in understanding, whose darkness was not enlightened, which knew not God, denied the Lord, forfeited the place of the true Israel, persecuted God, hoped to reduce the Word to disgrace; and Him whom they crucified as a malefactor they crowned as a king. Wherefore the Man on whom they believed not, they shall know to be the loving God the Lord, the Just. Whom they provoked to show Himself to be the Lord, to Him when lifted up they bore witness, by encircling Him, who is exalted above every name, with the diadem of righteousness by the ever-blooming thorn. This diadem, being hostile to those who plot against Him, coerces them; and friendly to those who form the Church, defends them. This crown is the flower of those who have believed on the glorified One but covers with blood and chastises those who have not believed. It is a symbol, too, of the Lord's successful work, He having borne on His head, the princely part of His body, all our iniquities by which we were pierced. For He by His. own passion rescued us from offences, and sins, and such like thorns; and having destroyed the devil, deservedly said in triumph, \"O Death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-39-P3999_1228536:171-nf] And we eat grapes from thorns, and figs from thistles; while those to whom He stretched forth His hands-the disobedient and unfruitful people-He lacerates into wounds. I can also show you another mystic meaning in it.[fn-40-P4000_1228776:172-nf] For when the Almighty Lord of the universe began to legislate by the Word, and wished His power to be manifested to Moses, a godlike vision of light that had assumed a shape was shown him in the burning bush (the bush is a thorny plant); but when the Word ended the giving of the law and His stay with men, the Lord was again mystically crowned with thorn. On His departure from this world to the place whence He came, He repeated the beginning of His old descent, in order that the Word beheld at first in the bush, and afterwards taken up crowned by the thorn, might show the whole to be the work of one power, He Himself being one, the Son of the Father, who is truly one, the beginning and the end of time.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":27,"verse":51,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_44_oration_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XX.

Nor did he trouble himself to take note of all that is related concerning Judas; how this Judas, having come to entertain opposite and conflicting opinions regarding his Master neither opposed Him with his whole soul, nor yet with his whole soul preserved the respect due by a pupil to his teacher. For be that betrayed Him gave to the multitude that came to apprehend Jesus, a sign, saying, \"Whomsoever I shall kiss, it is he; seize ye him,\"-retaining still some element of respect for his Master: for unless he had done so, he would have betrayed Him, even publicly, without any pretence of affection. This circumstance, therefore, will satisfy all with regard to the purpose of Judas, that along with his covetous disposition, and his wicked design to betray his Master, he had still a feeling of a mixed character in his mind, produced in him by the words of Jesus, which had the appearance (so to speak) of some remnant of good. For it is related that, \"when Judas, who betrayed Him, knew that He was condemned, he repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the high priest and elders, saying, I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou to that; \"[fn-80-P8071_1978824:40-nf] -and that, having thrown the money down in the temple, he departed, and went and hanged himself. But if this covetous Judas, who also stole the money placed in the bag for the relief of the poor, repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, it is clear that the instructions of Jesus had been able to produce some feeling of repentance in his mind, and were not altogether despised and loathed by this traitor. Nay, the declaration, \"I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood,\" was a public acknowledgment of his crime. Observe, also, how exceedingly passionate[fn-80-P8072_1979468:41-nf] was the sorrow for his sins that proceeded from that repentance, and which would not suffer him any longer to live; and how, after he had cast the money down in the temple, he withdrew, and went away and hanged himself: for he passed sentence upon himself, showing what a power the teaching of Jesus had over this sinner Judas, this thief and traitor, who could not always treat with contempt what he had learned from Jesus. Will Celsus and his friends now say that those proofs which show that the apostasy of Judas was not a complete apostasy, even after his attempts against his Master, are inventions, and that this alone is true, viz., that one of His disciples betrayed Him; and will they add to the Scriptural account that he betrayed Him also with his whole heart? To act in this spirit of hostility with the same writings, both as to what we are to believe and what we are not to believe, is absurd.[fn-80-P8073_1980403:42-nf] And if we must make a statement regarding Judas which may overwhelm our opponents with shame, we would say that, in the book of Psalms, the whole of the Psalms 108 contains a prophecy about Judas, the beginning of which is this: \"O God, hold not Thy peace before my praise; for the mouth of the sinner, and the mouth of the crafty man, are opened against me.\"[fn-80-P8074_1980778:43-nf] And it is predicted in this psalm, both that Judas separated himself from the number of the apostles on account of his sins, and that another was selected in his place; and this is shown by the words: \"And his bishopric let another take.\"[fn-80-P8075_1981061:44-nf] But suppose now that He had been betrayed by some one of His disciples, who was possessed by a worse spirit than Judas, and who had completely poured out, as it were, all the words which he had heard from Jesus, what would this contribute to an accusation against Jesus or the Christian religion? And how will this demonstrate its doctrine to be false? We have replied in the preceding chapter to the statements which follow this, showing that Jesus was not taken prisoner when attempting to flee, but that He gave Himself up voluntarily for the sake of us all. Whence it follows, that even if He were bound, He was bound agreeably to His own will; thus teaching us the lesson that we should undertake similar things for the sake of religion in no spirit of unwillingness.

For let him believe from our own Scriptures that Peter obtained his freedom after having been bound in prison, an angel having loosed his chains; and that Paul, having been bound in the stocks along with Silas in Philippi of Macedonia, was liberated by divine power, when the gates of the prison were opened. But it is probable that Celsus treats these accounts with ridicule, or that he never read them; for he would probably say in reply, that there are certain sorcerers who are able by incantations to unloose chains and to open doors, so that he would liken the events related in our histories to the doings of sorcerers. \"But,\" he continues, \"no calamity happened even to him who condemned him, as there did to Pentheus, viz., madness or discerption.\"[fn-81-P8189_2031795:86-nf] And yet he does not know that it was not so much Pilate that condemned Him (who knew that \"for envy the Jews had delivered Him\"), as the Jewish nation, which has been condemned by God, and rent in pieces, and dispersed over the whole earth, in a degree far beyond what happened to Pentheus.

From what source now, Celsus, did you derive these statements, save from the Gospel narratives? And did you, accordingly, see that they were fit matters for reproach; while they who recorded them did not think that you, and such as you, would turn them into ridicule; but that others would receive from them an example how to despise those who ridiculed and mocked Him on account of His religion, who appropriately laid down His life for its sake? Admire rather their love of truth, and that of the Being who bore these things voluntarily for the sake of men, and who endured them with all constancy and long-suffering.

For the mere letter and narrative of the events which happened to Jesus do not present the whole view of the truth. For each one of them can be shown, to those who have an intelligent apprehension of Scripture, to be a symbol of something else. Accordingly, as His crucifixion contains a truth, represented in the words, \"I am crucified with Christ,\" and intimated also in these, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world; \"[fn-83-P8386_2104579:175-nf] and as His death was necessary, because of the statement, \"For in that He died, He died unto sin once,\"[fn-83-P8387_2104707:176-nf] and this, \"Being made conformable to His death,\"[fn-83-P8388_2104776:177-nf] and this, \"For if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him: \"[fn-83-P8389_2104868:178-nf] so also His burial has an application to those who have been made conformable to His death, who have been both crucified with Him, and have died with Him; as is declared by Paul, \"For we were buried with Him by baptism, and have also risen with Him.\"[fn-83-P8390_2105141:179-nf] These matters, however, which relate to His burial, and His sepulchre, and him who buried Him, we shall expound at greater length on a more suitable occasion, when it will be our professed purpose to treat of such things. But, for the present, it is sufficient to notice the clean linen in which the pure body of Jesus was to be enwrapped, and the new tomb which Joseph had hewn out of the rock, where \"no one was yet lying,\"[fn-83-P8391_2105590:180-nf] or, as John expresses it, \"wherein was never man yet laid.\"[fn-83-P8392_2105702:181-nf] And observe whether the harmony of the three evangelists here is not fitted to make an impression: for they have thought it right to describe the tomb as one that was \"quarried or hewn out of the rock; \"so that be who examines the words of the narrative may see something worthy of consideration, both in them and in the newness of the tomb,-a point mentioned by Matthew and John[fn-83-P8393_2106129:182-nf] -and in the statement of Luke and John,[fn-83-P8394_2106215:183-nf] that no one had ever been interred therein before. For it became Him, who was unlike other dead men (but who even in death manifested signs of life in the water and the blood), and who was, so to speak, a new dead man, to be laid in a new and clean tomb, in order that, as His birth was purer than any other (in consequence of His being born, not in the way of ordinary generation, but of a virgin), His burial also might have the purity symbolically indicated in His body being deposited in a sepulchre which was new, not built of stones gathered from various quarters, and having no natural unity, but quarried and hewed out of one rock, united together in all its parts. Regarding the explanation, however, of these points, and the method of ascending from the narratives themselves to the things which they symbolized, one might treat more profoundly, and in a manner more adapted to their divine character, on a more suitable occasion, in a work expressly devoted to such subjects. The literal narrative, however, one might thus explain, viz., that it was appropriate for Him who had resolved to endure suspension upon the cross, to maintain all the accompaniments of the character He had assumed, in order that He who as a man had been put to death, and who as a man had died, might also as a man be buried. But even if it had been related in the Gospels, according to the view of Celsus, that Jesus had immediately disappeared from the cross, he and other unbelievers would have found fault with the narrative, and would have brought against it some such objection as this: \"Why, pray, did he disappear after he had been put upon the cross, and not disappear before he suffered? \"If, then, after learning from the Gospels that He did not at once disappear from the cross, they imagine that they can find fault with the narrative, because it did not invent, as they consider it ought to have done, any such instantaneous disappearance, but gave a true account of the matter, is it not reasonable that they should accord their faith also to His resurrection, and should believe that He, according to His pleasure, on one occasion, when the doors were shut, stood in the midst of His disciples, and on another, after distributing bread to two of His acquaintances, immediately disappeared from view, after He had spoken to them certain words?","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":27,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_58_book_i","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2. Then, again, as to those things outside of their Pleroma, the following are some specimens of what they attempt to accommodate out of the Scriptures to their opinions. They affirm that the Lord came in the last times of the world to endure suffering, for this end, that He might indicate the passion which occurred to the last of the Aeons, and might by His own end announce the cessation of that disturbance which had risen among the Aeons. They maintain, further, that that girl of twelve years old, the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue,[fn-63-P6311_1450590:97-nf] to whom the Lord approached and raised her from the dead, was a type of Achamoth, to whom their Christ, by extending himself, imparted shape, and whom he led anew to the perception of that light which had forsaken her.

Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.'[fn-47-P4773_2353817:19-nf] See how mighty is the spirit of the prophets, that it was able to see all future things as though they were present, so that a traitor who was to be born hereafter should be condemned many centuries before. Finally, that the said sentence should be completed, the holy Matthias received the bishopric of that lost apostle. Let no one be so dull, no one so faithless, as to dispute this: Matthias won for himself a victory, not a wrong, in that he carried off the spoils of the traitor from the victory of the Lord Christ. Why then, after this, do you claim to yourself a bishopric as the heir of a worse traitor? Judas betrayed Christ in the flesh to the unbelievers; you in the spirit madly betrayed the holy gospel to the flames of sacrilege. Judas betrayed the Lawgiver to the unbelievers; you, as it were, betraying all that he had left, gave up the law of God to be destroyed by men. Whilst, had you loved the law, like the youthful Maccabees, you would have welcomed death for the sake of the laws of God (if indeed that can be said to be death to men which makes them immortal because they died for the Lord); for of those brethren we learn that one replied to the sacrilegious tyrant with these words of faith: `Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life; but the King of the world (who reigns for ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end) shall raise us up who have died for His laws, unto everlasting life.'[fn-47-P4774_2355270:20-nf] If you were to burn with fire the testament of a dead man, would you not be punished as the falsifier of a will?

Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts, of the earth for Thy possession. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.' And he warned the kings themselves in the following precepts, that they should not, like ignorant men devoid of understanding, seek to persecute the Christians, lest they should themselves be destroyed,-which precepts I would that we could teach them, seeing that they are ignorant of them; or, at least, that you would show them to them, as doubtless you would do if you desired that they should live; or, at any rate; if neither of the other courses be allowed, that your malice would have permitted them to read them for themselves. The first Psalm of David would certainly have persuaded them that they should live and reign as Christians; but meanwhile you deceive them, so long as they entrust themselves to you. For you represent to them things that are evil, and you hide from them what is good. Let them then at length read this, which they should have read already long ago. For what does he say, `Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Lay hold of instruction lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the right way. Since how quickly has His wrath kindled over you? Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.'[fn-53-P5366_2583840:266-nf] You urge on emperors, I say, with your persuasions, even as Pilate, whom, as we showed above, the Jews urged on, though he himself cried aloud, as he washed his hands before them all, `I am innocent of the blood of this just person,'[fn-53-P5367_2584102:267-nf] -as though a person could be clear from the guilt of a sin who had himself committed it. But, to say nothing of ancient examples, observe, from instances taken from your own party, how very many of your emperors and judges have perished in persecuting us. To pass over Nero, who was the first to persecute the Christians, Domitian perished almost in the same way as Nero, as also did Trajan, Geta,[fn-53-P5368_2584524:268-nf] Decius, Valerian, Diocletian; Maximian also perished, at whose command that men should burn incense to their gods, burning the sacred volumes, Marcellinus indeed first, but after him also Mensurius of Carthage, and Caecilianus, escaped death from the sacrilegious flames, surviving like some ashes or cinders from the burning. For the consciousness of the guilt of burning incense involved you all, as many as agreed with Mensurius. Macarius perished, Ursacius[fn-53-P5369_2585376:269-nf] perished, and all your counts perished in like manner by the vengeance of God. For Ursacius was slain in a battle with the barbarians, after which birds of prey with their savage talons, and the greedy teeth of dogs with their biting, tore him limb from limb. Was not he too a murderer at your suggestion, who, like king Ahab, whom we showed to have been persuaded by a woman, slew a poor and righteous man?[fn-53-P5370_2586591:270-nf] So you too do not cease to murder us, who are just and poor (poor, that is, in worldly wealth; for in the grace of God no one of us is poor). For even if you do not murder a man with your hands, you do not cease to do so with your butcherous tongues. For it is written, `Death and life are in the power of the tongue.'[fn-53-P5371_2586931:271-nf] All, therefore, who have been murdered, you the instigator of the deed, have slain. Nor indeed does the hand of the butcher glow save at the instigation of your tongue; and that terrible heat of the breast is inflamed by your words to take the blood of others,-blood that shall take a just vengeance upon him who shed it.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":27,"verse":52,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_67_book_vi_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"391","folder":"ANF-02","text":"If, then, He preached only to the Jews, who wanted the knowledge and faith of the Saviour, it is plain that, since God is no respecter of persons, the apostles also, as here, so there preached the Gospel to those of the heathen who were ready for conversion.
