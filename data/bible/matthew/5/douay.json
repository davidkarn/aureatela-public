For\nso they persecuted the prophets that were before you.","You are the salt of the earth.  But if the salt lose its savour,\nwherewith shall it be salted?  It is good for nothing anymore but to be\ncast out, and to be trodden on by men.","You are the light of the world.  A city seated on a mountain\ncannot be hid.","Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon\na candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the house.","So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good\nworks, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.","Do not think that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets.\nI am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.","For amen I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or\none tittle shall not pass of the law, till all be fulfilled.","He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments,\nand shall so teach men shall be called the least in the kingdom of\nheaven.

And whosoever shall say to his brother,\nRaca, shall be in danger of the council.  And whosoever shall say, Thou\nfool, shall be in danger of hell fire.","If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou\nremember that thy brother hath anything against thee;","Leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be\nreconciled to thy brother, and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift.","Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes, whilst thou art in\nthe way with him:  lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge,\nand the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into\nprison.","Amen I say to thee, thou shalt not go out from thence till thou\nrepay the last farthing.","You have heard that it was said to them of old:  Thou shalt not\ncommit adultery.","But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust\nafter her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.","And if thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it\nfrom thee.  For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should\nperish, rather than thy whole body be cast into hell.","And if thy right hand scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it\nfrom thee:  for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should\nperish, rather than that thy whole body go into hell.","And it hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him\ngive her a bill of divorce.","But I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife,\nexcepting the cause of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery:  and\nhe that shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.","Again you have heard that it was said to them of old, thou shalt\nnot forswear thyself:  but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.","But I say to you not to swear at all, neither by heaven for it is\nthe throne of God:","Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool:  nor by Jerusalem, for\nit is the city of the great king:","Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make\none hair white or black.","But let your speech be yea, yea:  no, no:  and that which is over\nand above these, is of evil.","You have heard that it hath been said:  An eye for an eye, and a\ntooth for a tooth.","But I say to you not to resist evil:  but if one strike thee on\nthy right cheek, turn to him also the other:","And if a man will contend with thee in judgment, and take away\nthy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him.","And whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two.","Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow\nof thee turn not away.","You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy\nneighbour, and hate thy enemy.","But I say to you, Love your enemies:  do good to them that hate\nyou:  and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you:","That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who\nmaketh his sun to rise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon the\njust and the unjust.","For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have?\ndo not even the publicans this?","And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more?  do not\nalso the heathens this?","Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is\nperfect."]}
