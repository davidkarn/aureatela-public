You will now-a-days find more doors of heathens without lamps and laurel-wreaths than of Christians. What does the case seem to be with regard to that species (of ceremony) also? If it is an idol's honour, without doubt an idol's honour is idolatry. If it is for a man's sake, let us again consider that all idolatry is for man's sake;[fn-7-P768_315582:115-nf] let us again consider that all idolatry is a worship done to men, since it is generally agreed even among their worshippers that aforetime the gods themselves of the nations were men; and so it makes no difference whether that superstitious homage be rendered to men of a former age or of this. Idolatry is condemned, not on account of the persons which are set up for worship, but on account of those its observances, which pertain to demons. \"The things which are Cµsar's are to be rendered to Cµsar.\"[fn-7-P769_316123:116-nf] It is enough that He set in apposition thereto, \"and to God the things which are God's.\" What things, then, are Cµsar's? Those, to wit, about which the consultation was then held, whether the poll-tax should be furnished to Cµsar or no. Therefore, too, the Lord demanded that the money should be shown Him, and inquired about the image, whose it was; and when He had heard it was Cµsar's, said, \"Render to Cµsar what are Cµsar's, and what are God's to God; \"that is, the image of Cµsar, which is on the coin, to Cµsar, and the image of God, which is on man,[fn-7-P770_316731:117-nf] to God; so as to render to Cµsar indeed money, to God yourself. Otherwise, what will be God's, if all things are Cµsar's? \"Then,\" do you say, \"the lamps before my doors, and the laurels on my posts are an honour to God? \"They are there of course, not because they are an honour to God, but to him who is honour in God's stead by ceremonial observances of that kind, so far as is manifest, saving the religious performance, which is in secret appertaining to demons. For we ought to be sure if there are any whose notice it escapes through ignorance of this world's literature, that there are among the Romans even gods of entrances; Cardea (Hinge-goddess), called after hinges, and Forculus (Door-god) after doors, and Limentinus (Threshold-god) after the threshold, and Janus himself (Gate-god) after the gate: and of course we know that, though names be empty and reigned, yet, when they are drawn down into superstition, demons and every unclean spirit seize them for themselves, through the bond of consecration. Otherwise demons have no name individually, but they there find a name where they find also a token. Among the Greeks likewise we read of Apollo Thyrµus, i.e. of the door, and the Antelii, or Anthelii, demons, as presiders over entrances. These things, therefore, the Holy Spirit foreseeing from the beginning, fore-chanted, through the most ancient prophet Enoch, that even entrances would come into superstitious use. For we see too that other entrances[fn-7-P771_318261:118-nf] are adored in the baths. But if there are beings which are adored in entrances, it is to them that both the lamps and the laurels will pertain. To an idol you will have done whatever you shall have done to an entrance. In this place I call a witness on the authority also of God; because it is not safe to suppress whatever may have been shown to one, of course for the sake of all. I know that a brother was severely chastised, the same night, through a vision, because on the sudden announcement of public rejoicings his servants had wreathed his gates. And yet himself had not wreathed, or commanded them to be wreathed; for he had gone forth from home before, and on his return had reprehended the deed. So strictly are we appraised with God in matters of this kind, even with regard to the discipline of our family.[fn-7-P772_319381:119-nf] Therefore, as to what relates to the honours due to kings or emperors, we have a prescript sufficient, that it behoves us to be in all obedience, according to the apostle's precept,[fn-7-P773_319704:120-nf] \"subject to magistrates, and princes, and powers; \"[fn-7-P774_319802:121-nf] but within the limits of discipline, so long as we keep ourselves separate from idolatry. For it is for this reason, too, that that example of the three brethren has forerun us, who, in other respects obedient toward king Nebuchodonosor rejected with all constancy the honour to his image,[fn-7-P775_320112:122-nf] proving that whatever is extolled beyond the measure of human honour, unto the resemblance of divine sublimity, is idolatry.

For you equally, by remaining quiet, affirm their majesty, by reason of which majesty you will seem to be bound.

In borrowing money from heathens under pledged[fn-8-P851_340286:172-nf] securities, Christians give a guarantee under oath, and deny themselves to have done so. Of course, the time of the prosecution, and the place of the judgment seat, and the person of the presiding judge, decide that they knew themselves to have so done.[fn-8-P852_340564:173-nf] Christ prescribes that there is to be no swearing. \"I wrote,\" says the debtor, \"but I said nothing. It is the tongue, not the written letter, which kills.\" Here I call Nature and Conscience as my witnesses: Nature, because even if the tongue in dictating remains motionless and quiet, the hand can write nothing which the soul has not dictated; albeit even to the tongue itself the soul may have dictated either something conceived by itself, or else something delivered by another. Now, lest it be said, \"Another dictated,\" I here appeal to Conscience whether, what another dictated, the soul entertains,[fn-8-P853_342253:174-nf] and transmits unto the hand, whether with the concomitance or the inaction of the tongue. Enough, that the Lord has said faults are committed in the mind and the conscience. If concupiscence or malice have ascended into a man's heart, He saith it is held as a deed.[fn-8-P854_342611:175-nf] You therefore have given a guarantee; which clearly has \"ascended into your heart,\" which you can neither contend you were ignorant of nor unwilling; for when you gave the guarantee, you knew that you did it; when you knew, of course you were willing: you did it as well in act as in thought; nor can you by the lighter charge exclude the heavier,[fn-8-P855_342983:176-nf] so as to say that it is clearly rendered false, by giving a guarantee I for what you do not actually perform. \"Yet I have not denied, because I have not sworn.\" But you have sworn, since, even if you had done no such thing, you would still be said to swear, if you have even consented to so doing. Silence of voice is an unavailing plea in a case of writing; and muteness of sound in a case of letters. For Zacharias, when punished with a temporary privation of voice, holds colloquy with his mind, and, passing by his bootless tongue, with the help of his hands dictates from his heart, and without his mouth pronounces the name of his son.[fn-8-P856_343749:177-nf] Thus, in his pen there speaks a hand clearer than every sound, in his waxen tablet there is heard a letter more vocal that every mouth.[fn-8-P857_343917:178-nf] Inquire whether a man have spoken who is understood to have spoken.[fn-8-P858_344584:179-nf] Pray we the Lord that no necessity for that kind of contract may ever encompass us; and if it should so fall out, may He give our brethren the means of helping us, or give us constancy to break off all such necessity, lest those denying letters, the substitutes for our mouth, be brought forward against us in the day of judgment, sealed with the seals, not now of witnesses, but of angels!","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":48,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Handmaids of the living God, my fellow-servants and sisters, the right which I enjoy with you-I, the most meanest[fn-3-P355_73362:1-nf] in that right of fellow-servantship and brotherhood-emboldens me to address to you a discourse, not, of course, of affection, but paving the way for affection in the cause of your salvation. That salvation-and not (the salvation) of women only, but likewise of men-consists in the exhibition principally of modesty. For since, by the introduction into an appropriation[fn-3-P356_73750:2-nf] (in) us of the Holy Spirit, we are all\" the temple of God,\"[fn-3-P357_73825:3-nf] Modesty is the sacristan and priestess of that temple, who is to suffer nothing unclean or profane to be introduced (into it), for fear that the God who inhabits it should be offended, and quite forsake the polluted abode. But on the present occasion we (are to speak) not about modesty, for the enjoining and exacting of which the divine precepts which press (upon us) on every side are sufficient; but about the matters which pertain to it, that is, the manner in which it behoves you to walk. For most women (which very thing I trust God may permit me, with a view, of course, to my own personal censure, to censure in all), either from simple ignorance or else from dissimulation, have the hardihood so to walk as if modesty consisted only[fn-3-P358_74608:4-nf] in the (bare) integrity of the flesh, and in turning away from (actual) fornication; and there were no need for anything extrinsic to boot-in the matter (I mean) of the arrangement of dress and ornament,[fn-3-P359_74838:5-nf] the studied graces of form and brilliance:-wearing in their gait the self-same appearance as the women of the nations, from whom the sense of true modesty is absent, because in those who know not God, the Guardian and Master of truth, there is nothing true.[fn-3-P360_75169:6-nf] For if any modesty can be believed (to exist) in Gentiles, it is plain that it must be imperfect and undisciplined to such a degree that, although it be actively tenacious of itself in the mind up to a certain point, it yet allows itself to relax into licentious extravagances of attire; just in accordance with Gentile perversity, in craving after that of which it carefully shuns the effect.[fn-3-P361_75588:7-nf] How many a one, in short, is there who does not earnestly desire even to look pleasing to strangers? who does not on that very account take care to have herself painted out, and denies that she has (ever) been an object of (carnal) appetite? And yet, granting that even this is a practice familiar to Gentile modesty-(namely, ) not actually to commit the sin, but still to be willing to do so; or even not to be willing, yet still not quite to refuse-what wonder? for all things which are not God's are perverse. Let those women therefore look to it, who, by not holding fast the whole good, easily mingle with evil even what they do hold fast.

For so it is said, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-2-P277_96933:75-nf] This shall be when the Lord shall have come, and \"shall have brought to light the hidden things of darkness;\"[fn-2-P278_97062:76-nf] when the darkness of this present mortality and corruption shall have passed away. Then will be our morning, which is spoken of in the Psalm, \"In the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will contemplate Thee.\"[fn-2-P279_97302:77-nf] Of this contemplation I understand it to be said, \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;\" that is, when He shall have brought the just, over whom now, living by faith, the Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, reigns, to the contemplation of God, even the Father. If herein I am foolish, let him who knows better correct me; to me at least the case seems as I have said.[fn-2-P280_97733:78-nf] For we shall not seek anything else, when we shall have come to the contemplation of Him. But that contemplation is not yet, so long as our joy is in hope. For \"hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it,\"[fn-2-P281_98566:79-nf] viz. \"as long as the King sitteth at His table.\"[fn-2-P282_98639:80-nf] Then will take place that which is written, \"In Thy presence is fullness of joy.\"[fn-2-P283_98739:81-nf] Nothing more than that joy will be required; because there will be nothing more than can be required. For the Father will be manifested to us, and that will suffice for us. And this much Philip had well understood, so that he said to the Lord, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\" But he had not yet understood that he himself was able to say this very same thing in this way also: Lord, show Thyself to us, and it sufficeth us. For, that he might understand this, the Lord replied to him, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" But because He intended him, before he could see this, to live by faith, He went on to say, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?\"[fn-2-P284_99533:82-nf] For \"while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, not by sight.\"[fn-2-P285_99661:83-nf] For contemplation is the recompense of faith, for which recompense our hearts are purified by faith; as it is written, \"Purifying their hearts by faith.\"[fn-2-P286_99836:84-nf] And that our hearts are to be purified for this contemplation, is proved above all by this text, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-2-P287_100007:85-nf] And that this is life eternal, God says in the Psalm, \"With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation,\"[fn-2-P288_100142:86-nf] Whether, therefore, we hear, Show us the Son; or whether we hear, Show us the Father; it is even all one, since neither can be manifested without the other.

Yet unless the very same were the Son of man on account of the form of a servant which He took, who is the Son of God on account of the form of God in which He is; Paul the apostle would not say of the princes of this world, \"For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-3-P388_134737:164-nf] For He was crucified after the form of a servant, and yet \"the Lord of glory\" was crucified. For that \"taking\" was such as to make God man, and man God. Yet what is said on account of what, and what according to what, the thoughtful, diligent, and pious reader discerns for himself, the Lord being his helper. For instance, we have said that He glorifies His own, as being God, and certainly then as being the Lord of glory; and yet the Lord of glory was crucified, because even God is rightly said to have been crucified, not after the power of the divinity, but after the weakness of the flesh:[fn-3-P389_135355:165-nf] just as we say, that He judges as God, that is, by divine power, not by human; and yet the man Himself will judge, just as the Lord of glory was crucified: for soHe expressly says, \"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, and before Him shall be gathered all nations;\"[fn-3-P390_135686:166-nf] and the rest that is foretold of the future judgment in that place even to the last sentence.

But the ungodly without doubt will not see that form of God in which He is equal to the Father. For they are not pure in heart; and \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\"[fn-3-P392_136457:168-nf] And that sight is face to face,[fn-3-P393_136508:169-nf] the very sight that is promised as the highest reward to the just, and which will then take place when He \"shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;\" and in this \"kingdom\" He means the sight of His own form also to be understood, the whole creature being made subject to God, including that wherein the Son of God was made the Son of man. Because, according to this creature, \"The Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him, that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.\"[fn-3-P394_137036:170-nf] Otherwise if the Son of God, judging in the form in which He is equal to the Father, shall appear when He judges to the ungodly also; what becomes of that which He promises, as some great thing, to him who loves Him, saying, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him?\"[fn-3-P395_137342:171-nf] Wherefore He will judge as the Son of man, yet not by human power, but by that whereby He is the Son of God; and on the other hand, He will judge as the Son of God, yet not appearing in that [unincarnate] form in which He is God equal to the Father, but in that [incarnate form] in which He is the Son of man.[fn-3-P396_137673:172-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"31.

This is the form of the Son of man, the form which has been taken, the form that will appear in judgment, not only to the righteous, but also to the ungodly; and the sight of this form will not be for good to those who are wicked. But there is a sight of that form of mine, in which when I was, I thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but in order to take this form I emptied myself.[fn-4-P416_148519:189-nf] That one God, therefore, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, who will not appear, except for joy which cannot be taken away from the just; for which future joy he sighs, who says, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord:\"[fn-4-P417_148895:190-nf] that one God, therefore, Himself, I say, is alone good, for this reason, that no one sees Him for sorrow and wailing, but only for salvation and true joy. If you understand me after this latter form, then I am good; but if according to that former only, then why askest thou me about good? If thou art amongthose who \"shall look upon Him whom they have pierced,\"[fn-4-P418_149279:191-nf] that very sight itself will be evil to them, because it will be penal. That after this meaning, then, the Lord said, \"Why askest thou me about good? there is none good but One, that is, God,\" is probable upon those proofs which I have alleged, because that sight of God, whereby we shall contemplate the substance of God unchangeable and invisible to human eyes (which is promised to the saints alone; which the Apostle Paul speaks of, as \"face to face;\"[fn-4-P419_149756:192-nf] and of which the Apostle John says, \"We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;\"[fn-4-P420_149871:193-nf] and of which it is said, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord,\" and of which the Lord Himself says, \"I will both love him, and will manifest myself to him;\"[fn-4-P421_150093:194-nf] and on account of which alone we cleanse our hearts by faith, that we may be those \"pure in heart who are blessed for they shall see God:\"[fn-4-P422_150253:195-nf] and whatever else is spoken of that sight: which whosoever turns the eye of love to seek it, may find most copiously scattered through all the Scriptures),-that sight alone, I say, is our chief good, for the attaining of which we are directed to do whatever we do aright. But that sight of the Son of man which is foretold, when all nations shall be gathered before Him, and shall say to Him, \"Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or thirsty, etc.?\" will neither be a good to the ungodly, who shall be sent into everlasting fire, nor the chief good to the righteous. For He still goes on to call these to the kingdom which has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world. For, as He will say to those, \"Depart into everlasting fire;\" so to these,\" Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.\" And as those will go into everlasting burning; so the righteous will go into life eternal. But what is life eternal, except \"that they may know Thee,\" He says, \"the One true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent?\"[fn-4-P423_151320:196-nf] but know Him now in that glory of which He says to the Father, \"Which I had with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-4-P424_151459:197-nf] For then He will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,[fn-4-P425_151547:198-nf] that the good servant may enter into the joy of his Lord,[fn-4-P426_151627:199-nf] and that He may hide those whom God keeps in the hiding of His countenance from the confusion of men, namely, of those men who shall then be confounded by hearing this sentence; of which evil hearing \"the righteous man shall not be afraid\"[fn-4-P427_151893:200-nf] if only he be kept in \"the tabernacle,\" that is, in the true faith of the Catholic Church, from \"the strife of tongues,\"[fn-4-P428_152034:201-nf] that is, from the sophistries of heretics. But if there is any other explanation of the words of the Lord, where He says, \"Why asketh thou me about good? there is none good, but One, that is, God;\" provided only that the substance of the Father be not therefore believed to be of greater goodness than that of the Son, according to which He is the Word by whom all things were made; and if there is nothing in it abhorrent from sound doctrine; let us securely use it, and not one explanation only, but as many as we are able to find. For so much the more powerfully are the heretics proved wrong, the more outlets are open for avoiding their snares. But let us now start afresh, and address ourselves to the consideration of that which still remains.

Therefore, brethren, may this be the result of my admonition, that you understand that in raising your hearts to the Scriptures (when the gospel was sounding forth, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,\" and the rest that was read), you were lifting your eyes to the mountains, For unless the mountains said these things, you would not find out how to think of them at all. Therefore from the mountains came your help, that you even heard of these things; but you cannot yet understand what you have heard. Call for help from the Lord, who made heaven and earth; for the mountains were enabled only so to speak as not of themselves to illuminate, because they themselves are also illuminated by hearing. Thence John, who said these things, received them-he who lay on the Lord's breast, and from the Lord's breast drank in what he might give us to drink. But he gave us words to drink. Thou oughtest then to receive understanding from the source from which he drank who gave thee to drink; so that thou mayest lift up thine eyes to the mountains from whence shall come thine aid, so that from thence thou mayest receive, as it were, the cup, that is, the word, given thee to drink; and yet, since thy help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth, thou mayest fill thy breast from the source from which he filled his; whence thou saidst, \"My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth:\" let him, then, fill who can. Brethren, this is what I have said: Let each one lift up his heart in the manner that seems. fitting, and receive what is spoken. But perhaps you will say that I am more present to you than God, Far be such a thought from you! He is much more present to you; for I appear to your eyes, He presides over your consciences. Give me then your ears, Him your hearts, that you may fill both. Behold, your eyes, and those your bodily senses, you lift up to us; and yet not to us, for we are not of those mountains, but to the gospel itself, to the evangelist himself: your hearts, however, to the Lord to be filled. Moreover, let each one so lift up as to see what he lifts up, and whither. What do I mean by saying, \"what he lifts up, and whither?\" Let him see to it what sort of a heart he lifts up, because it is to the Lord he lifts it up, lest, encumbered by a load of fleshly pleasure, it fall ere ever it is raised. But does each one see that he bears a burden of flesh? Let him strive by continence to purify that which he may lift up to God.

But of this (latter) is the quaternion having the iota the one tittle,[fn-15-P1520_439515:46-nf] a perfect number. And there likewise is, according to the Pythagoreans, the i, the one tittle, which is chief and most dominant, and enables us to apprehend the substance of those intelligible entities which are capable of being understood through the medium of intellect and of sense. (And in this substance inhere) the nine incorporeal accidents which cannot exist without substance, viz., \"quality,\" and \"quantity,\" and \"relation,\" and \"where,\" and \"when,\" and \"position,\" and \"possession,\" and \"action,\" and \"passion.\" These, then, are the nine accidents (inhering in) substance, and when reckoned with these (substances), contains the perfect number, the i. Wherefore, the universe being divided, as we said, into the intelligible and sensible world, we have also reason from the intelligible (world), in order that by reason we may behold the substance of things that are cognised by intellect, and are incorporeal and divine. But we have, he says, five senses-smelling, seeing, hearing, taste, and touch. Now, by these we arrive at a knowledge of things that are discerned by sense; and so, he says, the sensible is divided from the intelligible world. And that we have for each of these an instrument for attaining knowledge, we perceive from the following consideration. Nothing, he says, of intelligibles can be known to us from sense. For he says neither eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor any whatsoever of the other senses known that (which is cognised by mind). Neither, again, by reason is it possible to arrive at a knowledge of any of the things discernible by sense. But one must see that a thing is white, and taste that it is sweet, and know by hearing that it is musical or out of tune. And whether any odour is fragrant or disagreeable, is the function of smell, not of reason. It is the same with objects of touch; for anything rough, or soft, or warm, or cold, it is not possible to know by hearing, but (far from it), for touch is the judge of such (sensations). Things being thus constituted, the arrangement of things that have been made and are being made is observed to happen in conformity with numerical (combinations). For in the same manner as, commencing from monad, by an addition of monads or triads, and a collection of the succeeding numbers, we make some one very large complex whole of number; (and) then, again, from an amassed number thus formed by addition, we accomplish, by means of a certain subtraction and re-calculation, a solution of the totality of the aggregate numbers; so likewise he asserts that the world, bound by a certain arithmetical and musical chain, was, by its tension and relaxation, and by addition and subtraction, always and for ever preserved in-corrupt.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"188","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"5.

Evidently this description cannot be taken literally (in fact, it is absurd to suppose a city the length, breadth and height of which are all twelve thousand furlongs), and therefore the details of it must be mystically understood. The great city which Cain first built and called after his son[fn-14-P1450_322272:980-nf] must be taken to represent this world, which the devil, that accuser of his brethren, that fratricide who is doomed to perish, has built of vice cemented with crime, and filled with iniquity. Therefore it is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt. Thus it is written, \"Sodom shall return to her former estate,\"[fn-14-P1451_322599:981-nf] that is to say, the world must be restored as it has been before. For we cannot believe that Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim[fn-14-P1452_322751:982-nf] are to be built again: they must be left to lie in ashes forever. We never read of Egypt as put for Jerusalem: it always stands for this world. To collect from Scripture the countless proofs of this would be tedious: I shall adduce but one passage, a passage in which this world is most clearly called Egypt. The apostle Jude, the brother of James, writes thus in his catholic epistle: \"I will, therefore, put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this how that Jesus,[fn-14-P1453_323245:983-nf] having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.\"[fn-14-P1454_323364:984-nf] And, lest you should fancy Joshua the son of Nun to be meant, the passage goes on thus: \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.\"[fn-14-P1455_323642:985-nf] Moreover, to convince you that in every place where Egypt, Sodom and Gomorrah are named together it is not these spots, but the present world, which is meant, he mentions them immediately in this sense. \"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah,\" he writes, \"and the cities about them, in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.\"[fn-14-P1456_324085:986-nf] But what need is there to collect more proofs when, after the passion and the resurrection of the Lord, the evangelist Matthew tells us: \"The rocks rent, and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared unto many\"?[fn-14-P1457_324434:987-nf] We must not interpret this passage straight off, as many people[fn-14-P1458_324539:988-nf] absurdly do, of the heavenly Jerusalem: the apparition there of the bodies of the saints could be no sign to men of the Lord's rising. Since, therefore, the evangelists and all the Scriptures speak of Jerusalem as the holy city, and since the psalmist commands us to worship the Lord \"at his footstool;\"[fn-14-P1459_324896:989-nf] allow no one to call it Sodom and Egypt, for by it the Lord forbids men to swear because\"it is the city of the great king.\"[fn-14-P1460_325042:990-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"574","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1. It surely becomes us, dearly beloved, not to abuse our rank as clergy, so as to make it an occasion of pride, but by diligently keeping and observing God's commandments, to be in reality what in name we profess to be. For, if the Holy Scriptures say, \"Their lots shall not profit them,\"[fn-17-P1783_427022:1234-nf] what pride in our clerical position[fn-17-P1784_427086:1235-nf] will be able to avail us who sin not only in thought and feeling, but in speech? I have heard, of course, that you are incensed against me, that you are angry, and that you threaten to write about me-not merely to particular places and provinces, but to the uttermost ends of the earth. Where is that fear of God which should make us tremble with the trembling spoken of by the Lord-\"Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment\"?[fn-17-P1785_427691:1236-nf] Not that I greatly care for your writing what you please. For Isaiah tells us[fn-17-P1786_427791:1237-nf] of letters written on papyrus and cast upon the waters-missives soon carried away by time and tide. I have done you no harm, I have inflicted no injury upon you, I have extorted nothing from you by violence. My action concerned a monastery whose inmates were foreigners in no way subject to your provincial jurisdiction. Moreover their regard for my insignificance and for the letters which I frequently addressed to them had commenced to produce a feeling of dislike to communion with you. Feeling, therefore, that too great strictness or scrupulosity on my part might have the effect of alienating them from the Church with its ancient faith, I ordained one of the brothers deacon, and after he had ministered as such, admitted him to the priesthood. You should, I think, have been grateful to me for this, knowing, as you surely must, that it is the fear of God which has compelled me to act in this way, and particularly when you recollect that God's priesthood is everywhere the same, and that I have simply made provision for the wants of the Church. For, although each individual bishop of the Church has under him churches which are placed in his charge, and although no man may stretch himself beyond his measure,[fn-17-P1787_429043:1238-nf] yet the love of Christ, which is without dissimulation,[fn-17-P1788_429126:1239-nf] is set up as an example to us all; and we must consider not so much the thing done as the time and place, the mode and motive, of doing it. I saw that the monastery contained a large number of reverend brothers, and that the reverend presbyters, Jerome and Vincent, through modesty and humility, were unwilling to offer the sacrifices permitted to their rank, and to labor in that part of their calling which ministers more than any other to the salvation of Christians. I knew, moreover, that you could not find or lay hands on this servant of God[fn-17-P1789_429697:1240-nf] who had several times fled from you simply because he was reluctant to undertake the onerous duties of the priesthood, and that no other bishop could easily find him. Accordingly, I was a good deal surprised when, by the ordering of God, he came to me with the deacons of the monastery and others of the brethren, to make satisfaction to me for some grievance or other which I had against them. While, therefore, the Collect[fn-17-P1790_430196:1241-nf] was being celebrated in the church of the villa which adjoins our monastery-he being quite ignorant and wholly unsuspicious of my purpose-I gave orders to a number of deacons to seize him and to stop his mouth, lest in his eagerness to free himself he might adjure me in the name of Christ. First of all, then, I ordained him deacon, setting before him the fear of God, and forcing him to minister; for he made a hard struggle against it, crying out that he was unworthy, and protesting that this heavy burden was beyond his strength. It was with difficulty, then, that I overcame his reluctance, persuading him as well as I could with passages from Scripture, and setting before him the commandments of God. And when he had ministered in the offering of the holy sacrifices, once more with great difficulty I closed his mouth and ordained him presbyter. Then, using the same arguments as before, I induced him to sit in the place set apart for the presbyters. After this I wrote to the reverend presbyters and other brothers of the monastery, chiding them for not having written to me about him. For a year before I had heard many of them complain that they had no one to celebrate for them the sacraments of the Lord. All then agreed in asking him to undertake the duty, pointing out how great his usefulness would be to the community of the monastery.

Instead of the three proofs from Holy Scripture which you said would satisfy you if I could produce them, behold I have given you seven. Who, then, will put up with the follies of Origen? I will not use a severer word and so make myself like him or his followers, who presume at the peril of their soul to assert dogmatically whatever first comes into their head, and to dictate to God, whereas they ought either to pray to Him or to learn the truth from Him. For some of them say that the image of God which Adam had previously received was lost when he sinned. Others surmise that the body which the Son of God was destined to take of Mary was the image of the Creator. Some identify this image with the soul, others with sensation, others with virtue. These make it baptism, those assert that it is in virtue of God's image that man exercises universal sway. Like drunkards in their cups, they ejaculate now this, now that, when they ought rather to have avoided so serious a risk, and to have obtained salvation by simple faith, not denying the words of God. To God they ought to have left the sure and exact knowledge of His own gift, and of the particular way in which He has created men in His image and after His likeness. Forsaking this course, they have involved themselves in many subtle questions, and through these they have been plunged into the mire of sin. But we, dearly beloved, believe the words of the Lord, and know that God's image remains in all men, and we leave it to Him to know in what respect man is created in His image. And let no one be deceived by that passage in the epistle of John, which some readers fail to understand, where he says: \"Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall See Him as He is.\"[fn-18-P1856_455057:1301-nf] For this refers to the glory which is then to be revealed[fn-18-P1857_455139:1302-nf] to His saints; just as also in another place we read the words \"from glory to glory,\"[fn-18-P1858_455247:1303-nf] of which glory the saints have even in this world received an earnest and a small portion.

Stephen, too, when he was being stoned, had the face of an angel visible to all.[fn-18-P1861_455741:1306-nf] And this which we have verified in a few cases is to be understood of all, that what is written may be fulfilled. \"Every one that sanctifieth himself shall be numbered among the blessed.\" For, \"blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-18-P1862_456013:1307-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"644","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"11.

I find joined to your letter of inquiries a short paper containing the following words: \"ask him,(that is me,) whether a woman who has left her husband on the ground that he is an adulterer and sodomite and has found herself compelled to take another may in the lifetime of him whom she first left be in communion with the church without doing penance for her fault.\" As I read the case put I recall the verse \"they make excuses for their sins.\"[fn-22-P2293_572105:1633-nf] We are all the and a indulgent to our own faults; and what our own will leads us to do we attribute to a necessity of nature. It is as though a young man were to say, \"I am over-borne by my body, the glow of nature kindles my passions, the structure of my frame and its reproductive organs call for sexual intercourse.\" Or again a murderer might say, \"I was in want, I stood in need of food, I had nothing to cover me. If i shed the blood of another, it was to save myself from dying of cold and hunger.\" Tell the sister, therefore, who thus enquires of me concerning her condition, not my sentence but that of the apostle. \"Know ye not, brethren (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband, so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then, if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress.\"[fn-22-P2294_573155:1634-nf] And in another place: \"the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.\"[fn-22-P2295_573359:1635-nf] The apostle has thus cut away every plea and has clearly declared that, if a woman marries again while her husband is living, she is an adulteress. You must not speak to me of the violence of a ravisher, a mother's pleading, a father's bidding, the influence of relatives, the insolence and the intrigues of servants, household losses. A husband may be an adulterer or a sodomite, he may be stained with every crime and may have been left by his wife because of his sins; yet he is still her husband and, so long as he lives, she may not marry another. The apostle does not promulgate this decree on his own authority but on that of Christ who speaks in him. For he has followed the words of Christ in the gospel: \"whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced, committeth adultery.\"[fn-22-P2296_574273:1636-nf] Mark what he says: \"whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.\" Whether she has put away her husband or her husband her, the man who marries her is still an adulterer. Wherefore the apostles seeing how heavy the yoke of marriage was thus made said to Him: \"if the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry,\" and the Lord replied, \"he that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" And immediately by the instance of the three eunuchs he shows the blessedness of virginity which is bound by no carnal tie.[fn-22-P2297_574843:1637-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"710","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

But as it is seeing I frankly admit him to be wrong, I may read him on the same terms as I read others, because if he is wrong so also are they.

I am now free to describe at greater length the virtue which was her peculiar charm; and in setting forth this I call God to witness that I am no flatterer. I add nothing. I exaggerate nothing. On the contrary I tone down much that I may not appear to relate incredibilities. My carping critics must not insinuate that I am drawing on my imagination or decking Paula, like sop's crow, with the fine feathers of other birds. Humility is the first of Christian graces, and hers was so pronounced that one who had never seen her, and who on account of her celebrity had desired to see her, would have believed that he saw not her but the lowest of her maids. When she was surrounded by companies of virgins she was always the least remarkable in dress, in speech, in gesture, and in gait. From the time that her husband died until she fell asleep herself she never sat at meat with a man, even though she might know him to stand upon the pinnacle of the episcopate. She never entered a bath except when dangerously ill. Even in the severest fever she rested not on an ordinary bed but on the hard ground covered only with a mat of goat's hair; if that can be called rest which made day and night alike a time of almost unbroken prayer. Well did she fulfil the words of the psalter: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tear\"![fn-40-P4017_1080317:2877-nf] Her tears welled forth as it were from fountains, and she lamented her slightest faults as if they were sins of the deepest dye. Constantly did I warn her to spare her eyes and to keep them for the reading of the gospel; but she only said: `I must disfigure that face which contrary to God's commandment I have painted with rouge, white lead, and antimony. I must mortify that body which has been given up to many pleasures. I must make up for my long laughter by constant weeping. I must exchange my soft linen and costly silks for rough goat's hair. I who have pleased my husband and the world in the past, desire now to please Christ.' Were I among her great and signal virtues to select her chastity as a subject of praise, my words would seem superfluous; for, even when she was still in the world, she set an example to all the matrons of Rome, and bore herself so admirably that themost slanderous never ventured to couple scandal with her name.[fn-40-P4018_1081313:2878-nf] No mind could be more considerate than hers, or none kinder towards the lowly. She did not court the powerful; at the same time, if the proud and the vainglorious sought her, she did not turn from them with disdain. If she saw a poor man, she supported him: and if she saw a rich one, she urged him to do good. Her liberality alone knew no bounds. Indeed, so anxious was she to turn no needy person away that she borrowed money at interest and often contracted new loans to pay off old ones. I was wrong, I admit; but when I saw her so profuse in giving, I reproved her alleging the apostle's words: \"I mean not that other men be eased and ye burthened; but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want.\"[fn-40-P4019_1082288:2879-nf] I quoted from the gospel the Saviour's words: \"he that hath two coats, let him impart one of them to him that hath none\";[fn-40-P4020_1082431:2880-nf] and I warned her that she might not always have means to do as she would wish. Other arguments I adduced to the same purpose; but with admirable modesty and brevity she overruled them all. \"God is my witness,\" she said, \"that what I do I do for His sake. My prayer is that I may die a beggar not leaving a penny to my daughter and indebted to strangers for my winding sheet.\" She then concluded with these words: \"I, if I beg, shall find many to give to me; but if this beggar does not obtain help from me who by borrowing can give it to him, he will die; and if he dies, of whom will his soul be required?\" I wished her to be more careful in managing her concerns, but she with a faith more glowing than mine clave to the Saviour with her whole heart and poor in spirit followed the Lord in His poverty, giving back to Him what she had received and becoming poor for His sake. She obtained her wish at last and died leaving her daughter overwhelmed with a mass of debt. This Eustochium still owes and indeed cannot hope to pay off by her own exertions; only the mercy of Christ can free her from it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1111","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"18.

And in this direction, too, runs that statement of the apostle: \"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle[fn-9-P960_375749:238-nf] unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that think differently;[fn-9-P961_375912:239-nf] if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.\"[fn-9-P962_376066:240-nf] \"Blessed,\" therefore, \"are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\"[fn-9-P963_376183:241-nf] ) ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_08_tractate_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"18.

These things we have, as we think, fully disposed of in the second and third books, treating in the second of evils in morals, which alone or chiefly are to be accounted evils; and in the third, of those which only fools dread to undergo-namely, those of the body or of outward things-which for the most part the good also suffer. But those evils by which they themselves become evil, they take, I do not say patiently, but with pleasure. And how few evils have I related concerning that one city and its empire! Not even all down to the time of Caesar Augustus. What if I had chosen to recount and enlarge on those evils, not which men have inflicted on each other; such as the devastations and destructions of war, but which happen in earthly things, from the elements of the world itself. Of such evils Apuleius speaks briefly in one passage of that book which he wrote, De Mundo, saying that all earthly things are subject to change, overthrow, and destruction.[fn-7-P717_344834:2-nf] For, to use his own words, by excessive earthquakes the ground has burst asunder, and cities with their inhabitants have been clean destroyed: by sudden rains whole regions have been washed away; those also which formerly had been continents, have been insulated by strange and new-come waves, and others, by the subsiding of the sea, have been made passable by the foot of man: by winds and storms cities have been overthrown; fires have flashed forth from the clouds, by which regions in the East being burnt up have perished; and on the western coasts the like destructions have been caused by the bursting forth of waters and floods. So, formerly, from the lofty craters of Etna, rivers of fire kindled by God have flowed like a torrent down the steeps. If I had wished to collect from history wherever I could, these and similar instances, where should I have finished what happened even in those times before the name of Christ had put down those of their idols, so vain and hurtful to true salvation? I promised that I should also point out which of their customs, and for what cause, the true God, in whose power all kingdoms are, had deigned to favor to the enlargement of their empire; and how those whom they think gods can have profited them nothing, but much rather hurt them by deceiving and beguiling them; so that it seems to me I must now speak of these things, and chiefly of the increase of the Roman empire. For I have already said not a little, especially in the second book, about the many evils introduced into their manners by the hurtful deceits of the demons whom they worshipped as gods. But throughout all the three books already completed, where it appeared suitable, we have set forth how much succor God, through the name of Christ, to whom the barbarians beyond the custom of war paid so much honor, has bestowed on the good and bad, according as it is written, \"Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and the evil, and giveth rain to the just and the unjust.\"[fn-7-P718_346882:3-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_101_epistle_lxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"6.

And this desire I think one ought to expel from the soul with all possible earnestness, not permitting it at the outset to be possessed by such a feeling, so that one may be able to do everything with freedom. For he who does not desire to be exhibited in possession of this authority, does not fear to be deposed from it, and not fearing this will be able to do everything with the freedom which becomes Christian men: whereas they who fear and tremble lest they should be deposed undergo a bitter servitude, filled with all kinds of evils, and are often compelled to offend against both God and man. Now the soul ought not to be affected in this way; but as in warfare we see those soldiers who are noble-spirited fight willingly and fall bravely, so they who have attained to this stewardship should be contented to be consecrated to the dignity or removed from it, as becomes Christian men, knowing that deposition of this kind brings its reward no less than the discharge of the office. For when any one suffers anything of this kind, in order to avoid submitting to something which is unbecoming or unworthy of this dignity, he procures punishment for those who wrongfully depose him, and a greater reward for himself. \"Blessed,\" says our Lord, \"are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven.\"[fn-3-P396_166510:23-nf] And this, indeed, is the case when any one is expelled by those of his own rank either on account of envy, with a view to the favor of others, or through hatred, or from any other wrong motive: but when it is the lot of any one to experience this treatment at the hand of opponents, I do not think a word is needed to prove what great gain they confer upon him by their wickedness.","title":"Book III.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1.

But if any one has already become awake towards God, kindled by the warmth of the Holy Spirit, and in the love of God has become vile in his own eyes; and through wishing, yet not having strength to come in unto Him, and through the light He gives, has given heed to himself, and has found himself, and has learned that his own filthiness cannot mingle with His purity; and feels it sweet to weep and to entreat Him, that again and again He will have compassion, until he have put off all his wretchedness; and to pray confidently, as having already received of free gift the pledge of salvation through his only Saviour and Enlightener of man:-such an one, so acting, and so lamenting, knowledge does not puff up, because charity edifieth;[fn-8-P806_311365:1-nf] for he has preferred knowledge to knowledge, he has preferred to know his own weakness, rather than to know the walls of the world, the foundations of the earth, and the pinnacles of heaven.

For look, in the old law I find the pruning-knife applied to the licence of repeated marriage. There is a caution in Leviticus: \"My priests shall not pluralize marriages.\"[fn-10-P1002_249840:33-nf] I may affirm even that that is plural which is not once for all. That which is not unity is number. In short, after unity begins number. Unity, moreover, is everything which is once for all. But for Christ was reserved, as in all other points so in this also, the \"fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-10-P1003_250272:34-nf] Thence, therefore, among us the prescript is more fully and more carefully laid down, that they who are chosen into the sacerdotal order must be men of one marriage;[fn-10-P1004_250494:35-nf] which rule is so rigidly observed, that I remember some removed from their office for digamy. But you will say, \"Then all others may (marry more than once), whom he excepts.\" Vain shall we be if we think that what is not lawful for priests[fn-10-P1005_250804:36-nf] is lawful for laics. Are not even we laics priests? It is written: \"A kingdom also, and priests to His God and Father, hath He made us.\"[fn-10-P1006_250960:37-nf] It is the authority of the Church, and the honour which has acquired sanctity through the joint session of the Order, which has established the difference between the Order and the laity. Accordingly, where there is no joint session of the ecclesiastical Order, you offer, and baptize, and are priest, alone for yourself. But where three are, a church is, albeit they be laics. For each individual lives by his own faith,[fn-10-P1007_251398:38-nf] nor is there exception of persons with God; since it is not hearers of the law who are justified by the Lord, but doers, according to what the apostle withal says.[fn-10-P1008_251621:39-nf] Therefore, if you have the right of a priest in your own person, in cases of necessity, it behoves you to have likewise the discipline of a priest whenever it may be necessary to have the fight of a priest. If you are a digamist, do you baptize? If you are a digamist, do you offer? How much more capital (a crime) is it for a digamist laic to act as a priest, when the priest himself, if he turn digamist, is deprived of the power of acting the priest! \"But to necessity,\" you say, \"indulgence is granted.\" No necessity is excusable which is avoidable. In a word, shun to be found guilty of digamy, and you do not expose yourself to the necessity of administering what a digamist may not lawfully administer. God wills us all to he so conditioned, as to be ready at all times and places to undertake (the duties of) His sacraments. There is \"one God, one faith,\"[fn-10-P1009_252556:40-nf] one discipline too. So truly is this the case, that unless the laics as well observe the rules which are to guide the choice of presbyters, how will there be presbyters at all, who are chosen to that office from among the laics? Hence we are bound to contend that the command to abstain from second marriage relates first to the laic; so long as no other can be a presbyter than a laic, provided he have been once for all a husband.","title":"V.

We have, however, already recognised the fact that no man wills as much as the duty demands, as also the testimony of the Scriptures, which we have quoted so largely above, declares. When, indeed, perfection is ascribed to any particular person; we must look carefully at the thing in which it is ascribed. For I have just above quoted a passage of the apostle, wherein he confesses that he was not yet perfect in the attainment of righteousness which he desired; but still he immediately adds, \"Let as many of us as are perfect be thus minded.\" Now he would certainly not have uttered these two sentences if he had not been perfect in one thing, and not in another. For instance, a man may be perfect as a scholar in the pursuit of wisdom: and this could not yet be said of those to whom [the apostle] said, \"I have fed you with milk, sand not with meat: for hitherto ye have notbeen able to bear it, neither are ye yet able;\"[fn-8-P896_512322:105-nf] whereas to those of whom it could be said he says,\" Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect,\" -meaning, of course, \"perfect pupils\" to be understood. It may happen, therefore, as I have said, that a man may be already perfect as a scholar, though not as yet perfect as a teacher of wisdom; may be perfect as a learner, though not as yet perfect as a doer of righteousness; may be perfect as a lover of his enemies, though not as yet perfect in bearing their wrong.[fn-8-P897_512821:106-nf] Even in the case of him who is so far perfect as to love all men, inasmuch as he has attained even to the love of his enemies, it still remains a question whether he be perfect in that love,-in other words, whether he so loves those whom he loves as is prescribed to be exercised towards those to be loved, by the unchangeable love of truth. Whenever, then, we read in the Scriptures of any man's perfection, it must be carefully considered in what it is asserted, since a man is not therefore to be understood as being entirely without sin because he is described as perfect in some particular thing; although the term may also be employed to show, not, indeed, that there is no longer any point left for a man to reach his way to perfection, but that he has in fact advanced a very great way, and on that account may be deemed worthy of the designation. Thus, a man may be said to be perfect in the science of the law, even if there be still something unknown to him; and in the same manner the apostle called men perfect, to whom he said at the same time, \"Yet if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.\"[fn-8-P898_514095:107-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_13_book_vii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"4. Why, then, is scarcely anything ever said in the Scriptures of wisdom, unless to show that it is begotten or created of God?-begotten in the case of that Wisdom by which all things are made; but created or made, as in men, when they are converted to that Wisdom which is not created anti made but begotten, and are so enlightened; for in these men themselves there comes to be something which may be called their wisdom: even as the Scriptures foretell or narrate, that \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;\"[fn-11-P1182_499909:4-nf] for in this way Christ was made wisdom, because He was made man. Is it on this account that wisdom does not speak in these books, nor is anything spoken of it, except to declare that it is born of God, or made by Him (although the Father is Himself wisdom), namely, because wisdom ought to be commended and imitated by us, by the imitation of which we are fashioned [rightly]? For the Father speaks it, that it may be His Word: yet not as a word producing a sound proceeds from the mouth, or is thought before it is pronounced. For this word is completed in certain spaces of time, but that is eternal, and speaks to us by enlightening us, what ought to be spoken to men, both of itself and of the Father. And therefore He says, \"No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father. save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him:\"[fn-11-P1183_500791:5-nf] since the Father reveals by the Son, that is, by His Word. For if that word which we utter, and which is temporal and transitory, declares both itself, and that of which we speak, how much more the Word of God, by which all things are made? For this Word so declares the Father as He is the Father; because both itself so is, and is that which is the Father, in so far as it is wisdom and essence. For in so far as it is the Word. it is not what the Father is: because the Word is not the Father, and Word is spoken relatively, as is also Son, which assuredly is not the Father. And therefore Christ is the power and wisdom of God, because He Himself, being also power and wisdom, is from the Father, who is power and wisdom; as He is light of the Father, who is light, and the fountain of life with God the Father, who is Himself assuredly the fountain of life. For \"with Thee,\" He says, \"is the fountain of life, and in Thy light shall we see light.\"[fn-11-P1184_501762:6-nf] Because, \"as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself:\"[fn-11-P1185_501880:7-nf] and, \"He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world:\" and this light, \"the Word,\" was \"with God;\" but \"the Word also was God;\"[fn-11-P1186_502050:8-nf] and \"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all:\"[fn-11-P1187_502121:9-nf] but a light that is not corporeal, but spiritual; yet not in such way spiritual, that it was wrought by illumination, as it was said to the apostles, \"Ye are the light of the world,\"[fn-11-P1188_502321:10-nf] but \"the light which lighteth every man,\" that very supreme wisdom itself who is God, of whom we now treat. The Son therefore is Wisdom of wisdom, namely the Father, as He is Light of light, and God of God; so that both the Father singly is light, and the Son singly is light; and the Father singly is God, and the Son singly is God: therefore the Father also singly is wisdom, and the Son singly is wisdom. And as both together are one light and one God, so both are one wisdom. But the Son is \"by God made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification;\"[fn-11-P1189_502903:11-nf] because we turn ourselves to Him in time, that is, from some particular time, that we may remain with Him for ever.

But it is by love that we must stand firm to this and cleave to this, in order that we may enjoy the presence of that by which we are, and in the absence of which we could not be at all. For as \"we walk as yet by faith, and not by sight,\"[fn-12-P1255_550207:7-nf] we certainly do not yet see God, as the same [apostle] saith, \"face to face:\"[fn-12-P1256_550301:8-nf] whom however we shall never see, unless now already we love. But who loves what he does not know? For it is possible something may be known and not loved: but I ask whether it is possible that what is not known can be loved; since if it cannot, then no one loves God before he knows Him. And what is it to know God except to behold Him and steadfastly perceive Him with the mind? For He is not a body to be searched out by carnal eyes. But before also that we have power to behold and to perceive God, as He can be beheld and perceived, which is permitted to the pure in heart; for \"blessed are the pure in heart. for they shall see God;\"[fn-12-P1257_550960:9-nf] except He is loved by faith, it will not be possible for the heart to be cleansed, in order that it may be apt and meet to see Him. For where are there those three, in order to build up which in the mind the whole apparatus of the divine Scriptures has been raised up, namely Faith, Hope, and Charity,[fn-12-P1258_551278:10-nf] except in a mind believing what it does not yet see, and hoping and loving what it believes? Even He therefore who is not known, but yet is believed, can be loved. But indisputably we must take care, lest the mind believing that which it does not see, feign to itself something which is not, and hope for and love that which is false. For in that case, it will not be charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, which is the end of the commandment, as the same apostle says.[fn-12-P1259_551810:11-nf] ","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-04","text":"After the ancient examples of the patriarchs, let us equally pass on to the ancient documents of the legal Scriptures, that we may treat in order of all our canon. And since there are some who sometimes assert that they have nothing to do with the law (which Christ has not dissolved, but fulfilled),[fn-11-P1139_297094:41-nf] sometimes catch at such parts of the law as they choose; plainly do we too assert that the law has deceased in this sense, that its burdens-according to the sentence of the apostles-which not even the fathers were able to sustain,[fn-11-P1140_297347:42-nf] have wholly ceased: such (parts), however. as relate to righteousness not only permanently remain reserved, but even amplified; in order, to be sure, that our righteousness may be able to redound above the righteousness of the scribes and of the Pharisees.[fn-11-P1141_297627:43-nf] If \"righteousness\" must, of course chastity must too. If, then, forasmuch as there is in the law a precept that a man is to take in marriage the wife of his brother if he have died without children,[fn-11-P1142_297844:44-nf] for the purpose of raising up seed to his brother; and this may happen repeatedly to the same person, according to that crafty question of the Sadducees;[fn-11-P1143_298020:45-nf] men for that reason think that frequency of marriage is permitted in other cases as well: it will be their duty to understand first the reason of the precept itself; and thus they will come to know that that reason, now ceasing, is among those parts of the law which have been cancelled.

Such is God's verdict, within straiter limits than men's, that universally, whether through marriage or promiscuously, the admission of a second man (to intercourse) is pronounced adultery by Him. For let us see what marriage is in the eye of God; and thus we shall learn what adultery equally is. Marriage is (this): when God joins \"two into one flesh; \"or else, finding (them already) joined in the same flesh, has given His seal to the conjunction. Adultery is (this): when, the two having been-in whatsoever way-disjoined, other-nay, rather alien-flesh is mingled (with either): flesh concerning which it cannot be affirmed, \"This is flesh out of my flesh, and this bone out of my bones.\"[fn-11-P1184_311022:79-nf] For this, once for all done and pronounced, as from the beginning, so now too, cannot apply to \"other\" flesh. Accordingly, it will be without cause that you will say that God wills not a divorced woman to be joined to another man \"while her husband liveth,\" as if He do will it \"when he is dead; \"[fn-11-P1185_311363:80-nf] whereas if she is not bound to him when dead, no more is she when living. \"Alike when divorce dissevers marriage as when death does, she will not be bound to him by whom the binding medium has been broken off.\" To whom, then, will she be bound? In the eye of God, it matters nought whether she marry during her life or after his death. For it is not against him that she sins, but against herself. \"Any sin which a man may have committed is external to the body; but ] (he) who commits adultery sins against his own body.\" But-as we have previously laid down above-whoever shall intermingle with himself \"other\" flesh, over and above that pristine flesh which God either conjoined into two or else found (already) conjoined, commits adultery. And the reason why He has abolished divorce, which \"was not from the beginning,\" is, thatHe may strengthen that which \"was from the beginning\"-the permanent conjunction, (namely), of \"two into one flesh: \"for fear that necessity or opportunity for a third union of flesh may make an irruption (into His dominion); permitting divorce to no cause but one-if, (that is), the (evil) against which precaution is taken chance to have occurred beforehand. So true, moreover, is it that divorce \"was not from the beginning,\" that among the Romans it is not till after the six hundredth year from the building of the city that this kind of \"hard-heartedness\"[fn-11-P1186_312782:81-nf] is set down as having been committed. But they indulge in promiscuous adulteries, even without divorcing (their partners): to us, even if we do divorce them, even marriage will not be lawful.","title":"VI.

And they, plainly, will give husbands and wives as they would morsels of bread; for this is their rendering of \"To every one who asketh thee thou shalt give!\"[fn-11-P1198_318501:86-nf] And they will join you together in a virgin church, the one betrothed of the one Christ! And you will pray for your husbands, the new and the old. Make your election, to which of the twain you will play the adulteress. I think, to both. But if you have any wisdom, be silent on behalf of the dead one. Let your silence be to him a divorce, already endorsed in the dotal gifts of another.

But the sense in which the apostle did write will be apparent, if first an agreement be come to that he did not write it in the sense of which the Psychics avail themselves. Such an agreement, moreover, will be come to if one first recall to mind those (passages) which are diverse from the passage in question, when tried by the standard of doctrine, of volition, and of Paul's own discipline. For, if he permits second nuptials, which were not \"from the beginning,\" how does he affirm that all things are being recollected to the beginning in Christ?[fn-12-P1200_320246:88-nf] If he wills us to iterate conjugal connections, how does he maintain that \"our seed is called\" in the but once married Isaac as its author? How does he make monogamy the base of his disposition of the whole Ecclesiastical Order, if this rule does not antecedently hold good in the case of laics, from whose ranks the Ecclesiastical Order proceeds?[fn-12-P1201_320616:89-nf] How does he call away from the enjoyment of marriage such as are still in the married position, saying that \"the time is wound up,\" if he calls back again into marriage such as through death had escaped from marriage? If these (passages) are diverse from that one about which the present question is, it will be agreed (as we have said) that he did not write in that sense of which the Psychics avail themselves; inasmuch as it is easier (of belief) that that one passage should have some explanation agreeable with the others, than that an apostle should seem to have taught (principles) mutually diverse. That explanation we shall be able to discover in the subject-matter itself. What was the subject-matter which led the apostle to write such (words)? The inexperience of a new and just rising Church, which he was rearing, to wit, \"with milk,\" not yet with the \"solid food\"[fn-12-P1202_321526:90-nf] of stronger doctrine; inexperience so great, that that infancy of faith prevented them from yet knowing what they were to do in regard of carnal and sexual necessity. The very phases themselves of this (inexperience) are intelligible from (the apostle's) rescripts, when he says:[fn-12-P1203_321851:91-nf] \"But concerning these (things) which ye write; good it is for a man not to touch a woman; but, on account of fornications, let each one have his own wife.\" He shows that there were who, having been \"apprehended by the faith\" in (the state of) marriage, were apprehensive that it might not be lawful for them thenceforward to enjoy their marriage, because they had believed on the holy flesh of Christ. And yet it is \"by way of allowance\" that he makes the concession, \"not by way of command; \"that is, indulging, not enjoining, the practice. On the other hand, he \"willed rather\" that all should be what he himself was. Similarly, too, in sending a rescript on (the subject of) divorce, he demonstrates that some had been thinking over that also, chiefly because withal they did not suppose that they were to persevere, after faith, in heathen marriages. They sought counsel, further, \"concerning virgins\"-for \"precept of the Lord\" there was none-(and were told) that \"it is good for a man if he so remain permanently; \"(\"so\"), of course, as he may have been found by the faith. \"Thou hast been bound to a wife, seek not loosing; thou hast been loosed from a wife, seek not a wife.\" \"But if thou shalt have taken to (thyself) a wife, thou hast not sinned; \"because to one who, before believing, had been \"loosed from a wife,\" she will not be counted a second wife who, subsequently to believing, is the first: for it is from (the time of our) believing that our life itself dates its origin. But here he says that he \"is sparing them; \"else \"pressure of the flesh\" would shortly follow, in consequence of the straits of the times, which shunned the encumbrances of marriage: yea, rather solicitude must be felt about earning the Lord's favour than a husband's. And thus he recalls his permission. So, then, in the very same passage in which he definitely rules that \"each one ought permanently to remain in that calling in which he shall be called; \"adding, \"A woman is bound so long as her husband liveth; but if he shall have fallen asleep, she is free: whom she shall wish let her marry, only in the Lord,\" he hence also demonstrates that such a woman is to be understood as has withal herself been \"found\" (by the faith) \"loosed from a husband,\" similarly as the husband \"loosed from a wife\"-the \"loosing\" having taken place through death, of course, not through divorce; inasmuch as to the divorced he would grant no permission to marry, in the teeth of the primary precept. And so \"a woman, if she shall have married, will not sin; \"because he will not be reckoned a second husband who is, subsequently to her believing, the first, any more (than a wife thus taken will be counted a second wife). And so truly is this the case, that he therefore adds, \"only in the Lord; \"because the question in agitation was about her who had had a heathen (husband), and had believed subsequently to losing him: for fear, to wit, that she might presume herself able to marry a heathen even after believing; albeit not even this is an object of care to the Psychics. Let us plainly know that, in the Greek original, it does not stand in the form which (through the either crafty or simple alteration of two syllables) has gone out into common use, \"But if her husband shall have fallen asleep,\" as if it were speaking of the future, and thereby seemed to pertain to her who has lost her husband when already in a believing state. If this indeed had been so, licence let loose without limit would have granted a (fresh) husband as often as one had been lost, without any such modesty in marrying as is congruous even to heathens. But even if it had been so, as if referring to future tim, e, \"If any (woman's). husband shall have died, even the future would just as much pertain to her whose husband shall die before she believed. Take it which way you. will, provided you do not overturn the rest. For since these (other passages) agree to the sense (given above): \"Thou hast been called (as) a slave; care not: \"\"Thou hast been called in uncircumcision; be not circumcised: \"\"Thou hast been called in circumcision; become not uncircumcised: \"with which concurs, \"Thou hast been bound to a wife; seek not loosing: thou hast been loosed from a wife; seek not a wife,\"-manifest enough it is that these passages pertain to such as, finding themselves in a new and recent \"calling,\" were consulting (the apostle) on the subject of those (circumstantial conditions) in which they had been \"apprehended\" by the faith.","title":"VI.

If this indeed had been so, licence let loose without limit would have granted a (fresh) husband as often as one had been lost, without any such modesty in marrying as is congruous even to heathens. But even if it had been so, as if referring to future tim, e, \"If any (woman's). husband shall have died, even the future would just as much pertain to her whose husband shall die before she believed. Take it which way you. will, provided you do not overturn the rest. For since these (other passages) agree to the sense (given above): \"Thou hast been called (as) a slave; care not: \"\"Thou hast been called in uncircumcision; be not circumcised: \"\"Thou hast been called in circumcision; become not uncircumcised: \"with which concurs, \"Thou hast been bound to a wife; seek not loosing: thou hast been loosed from a wife; seek not a wife,\"-manifest enough it is that these passages pertain to such as, finding themselves in a new and recent \"calling,\" were consulting (the apostle) on the subject of those (circumstantial conditions) in which they had been \"apprehended\" by the faith.","title":"VI.

For how can it be that \"the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,\" if what follows is also true: \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man?\"[fn-13-P1363_675512:56-nf] For who but a righteous man lawfully uses the law? Yet it is not for him that it is made, but for the unrighteous. Must then the unrighteous man, in order that he may be justified,- that is, become a righteous man,- lawfully use the law, to lead him, as by the schoolmaster's hand,[fn-13-P1364_675812:57-nf] to that grace by which alone he can fulfil what the law commands? Now it is freely that he is justified thereby,-that is, on account of no antecedent merits of his own works; \"otherwise grace is no more grace,\"[fn-13-P1365_676042:58-nf] since it is bestowed on us, not because we have done good works, but that we may be able to do them,- in other words, not because we have fulfilled the law, but in order that we may be able to fulfil the law. Now He said, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-13-P1366_676335:59-nf] of whom it was said, \"We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-13-P1367_676474:60-nf] This is the glory which is meant in the words, \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\"[fn-13-P1368_676593:61-nf] and this the grace of which he speaks in the next verse, \"Being justified freely by His grace.\"[fn-13-P1369_676709:62-nf] The unrighteous man therefore lawfully uses the law, that he may become righteous; but when he has become so, he must no longer use it as a chariot, for he has arrived at his journey's end,- or rather (that I may employ the apostle's own simile, which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he is now fully learned. How then is the law not made for a righteous man, if it is necessary for the righteous man too, not that hemay be brought as an unrighteous man to the grace that justifies, but that he may use it lawfully, now that he is righteous? Does not the case perhaps stand thus, -nay, not perhaps, but rather certainly,- that the man who is become righteous thus lawfully uses the law, when he applies it to alarm the unrighteous, so that whenever the disease of some unusual desire begins in them, too, to be augmented by the incentive of the law's prohibition and an increased amount of transgression, they may in faith flee for refuge to the grace that justifies, and becoming delighted with the sweet pleasures of holiness, may escape the penalty of the law's menacing letter through the spirit's soothing gift? In this way the two statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each other: even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the law be not made for the righteous man; for it is not by the law that he becomes righteous, but by the law of faith, which led him to believe that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling the precepts which \"the law of works\"[fn-13-P1370_678276:63-nf] commanded, except to be assisted by the grace of God.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"After saying, \"Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt,\" observe what He adds: \"Because they continued not in my covenant.\" He reckons it as their own fault that they did not continue in God's covenant, lest the law, which they received at that time, should seem to be deserving of blame.

But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-15-P1505_717589:144-nf] Out of this promise, that is, out of the kindness of God, the law is fulfilled, which without the said promise only makes men transgressors, either by the actual commission of some sinful deed, if the flame of concupiscence have greater power than even the restraints of fear, or at least by their mere will, if the fear of punishment transcend the pleasure of lust. In what he says, \"The Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe,\" it is the benefit of this \"conclusion\" itself which is asserted.

Now it was not through any fault of its own that the law was not fulfilled, but by the fault of the carnal mind;and this fault was to be demonstrated by the law, and healed by grace. \"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1507_718999:146-nf] Accordingly, in the passage which we cited from the prophet, he says, \"I will consummate a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,\"[fn-15-P1508_719183:147-nf] - and what means I will consummate but I will fulfil? -\"not, according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-15-P1509_719407:148-nf] ","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"183","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But there is yet another distinction to be observed,-since they who are under the law both attempt to work their own righteousness through fear of punishment, and fail to do God's righteousness, because this is accomplished by the love to which only what is lawful is pleasing, and never by the fear which is forced to have in its work the thing which is lawful, although it has something else in its will which would prefer, if it were only possible, that to be lawful which is not lawful. These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which is said of them, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled?\"[fn-17-P1738_775648:311-nf] Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him.

It was therefore necessary to mention God's loving-kindness and tender mercy there, where one might expect debts to be demanded and deserts recompensed so strictly as to leave no room for mercy. He crowns, therefore, with loving-kindness and tender mercy; but even so according to works. For he shall be separated to the right hand, to whom, it is said, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat.\"[fn-17-P1783_787204:347-nf] There will, however, be also \"judgment without mercy;\" but it will be for him\" that hath not showed mercy.\"[fn-17-P1784_787334:348-nf] But \"blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\"[fn-17-P1785_787414:349-nf] of God. Then, as soon as those on the left hand shall have gone into eternal fire, the righteous, too, shall go into everlasting life,[fn-17-P1786_787568:350-nf] because He says: \"This is life eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-17-P1787_787712:351-nf] And with this knowledge, this vision, this contemplation, shall the desire of their soul be satisfied; for it shall be enough for it to have this and nothing else,-there being nothing more for it to desire, to aspire to, or to require. It was with a craving after this full joy that his heart glowed who said to the Lord Christ, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;\" and to whom the answer was returned,\" He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-17-P1788_788187:352-nf] Because He is Himself the eternal life, in order that men may know the one true God, Thee and whom Thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.

It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now applicable: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;\"[fn-18-P1841_803645:387-nf] but in reference to the present life the following: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\"[fn-18-P1842_803803:388-nf] To the one, again, belongs, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-18-P1843_803875:389-nf] to the other, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-18-P1844_803945:390-nf] To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,-so that in the one the just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_08_book_i_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"37.

He boasts that David bought his wife for two hundred foreskins. But he should remember that David had numerous other wives, and afterwards received Michal, Saul's daughter, whom her father had delivered to another, and when he was old got heat from the embrace of the Shunammite maiden. And I do not say this because I am bold enough to disparage holy men, but because it is one thing to live under the law, another to live under the Gospel. David slew Uriah the Hittite and committed adultery with Bathsheba. And because he was a man of blood-the reference is not, as some think, to his wars, but to the[fn-63-P6302_1929912:145-nf] murder-he was not permitted to build a temple of the Lord.

For every one is judged not for what he will be, but for what he is. But if Jovinianus approves the example of Solomon, he will no longer be in favour of second and third marriages only, but unless he has seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, he cannot be the king's antitype or attain to his merit.

Yes, but he pleased God before his circumcision;[fn-20-P2071_705176:37-nf] nor yet did he observe the Sabbath. For he had \"accepted\"[fn-20-P2072_705290:38-nf] circumcision; but such as was to be for \"a sign\" of that time, not for a prerogative title to salvation. In fact, subsequent patriarchs were uncircumcised, like Melchizedek, who, uncircumcised, offered to Abraham himself, already circumcised, on his return from battle, bread and wine.[fn-20-P2073_705681:39-nf] \"But again,\" (you say) \"the son of Moses would upon one occasion have been choked by an angel, if Zipporah,[fn-20-P2074_706106:40-nf] had not circumcised the foreskin of the infant with a pebble; whence, \"there is the greatest peril if any fail to circumcise the foreskin of his flesh.\" Nay, but if circumcision altogether brought salvation, even Moses himself, in the case of his own son, would not have omitted to circumcise him on the eighth day; whereas it is agreed that Zipporah did it on the journey, at the compulsion of the angel. Consider we, accordingly, that one single infant's compulsory circumcision cannot have prescribed to every people, and rounded, as it were, a law for keeping this precept. For God, foreseeing that He was about to give this circumcision to the people of Israel for \"a sign,\" not for salvation, urges the circumcision of the son of Moses, their future leader, for this reason; that, since He had begun, through him, to give the People the precept of circumcision, the people should not despise it, from seeing this example (of neglect) already exhibited conspicuously in their leader's son. For circumcision had to be given; but as \"a sign,\" whence Israel in the last time would have to be distinguished, when, in accordance with their deserts, they should be prohibited from entering the holy city, as we see through the words of the prophets, saying, \"Your land is desert; your cities utterly burnt with fire; your country, in your sight, strangers shall eat up; and, deserted and subverted by strange peoples, the daughter of Zion shall be derelict, like a shed in a vineyard, and like a watchhouse in a cucumber-field, and as it were a city which is being stormed.\"[fn-20-P2075_707833:41-nf] Why so? Because the subsequent discourse of the prophet reproaches them, saying, \"Sons have I begotten and upraised, but they have reprobated me; \"[fn-20-P2076_708021:42-nf] and again, \"And if ye shall have outstretched hands, I will avert my face from you; and if ye shall have multiplied prayers, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of blood; \"[fn-20-P2077_708290:43-nf] and again, \"Woe! sinful nation; a people full of sins; wicked sons; ye have quite forsaken God, and have provoked unto indignation the Holy One of Israel.\"[fn-20-P2078_708463:44-nf] This, therefore, was God's foresight,-that of giving circumcision to Israel, for a sign whence they might be distinguished when the time should arrive wherein their above-mentioned deserts should prohibit their admission into Jerusalem: which circumstance, because it was to be, used to be announced; and, because we see it accomplished, is recognised by us. For, as the carnal circumcision, which was temporary, was in wrought for \"a sign\" in a contumacious people, so the spiritual has been given for salvation to an obedient people; while the prophet Jeremiah says, \"Make a renewal for you, and sow not in thorns; be circumcised to God, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart: \"[fn-20-P2079_709164:45-nf] and in another place he says, \"Behold, days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will draw up, for the house of Judah and for the house of Jacob,[fn-20-P2080_709404:46-nf] a new testament; not such as I once gave their fathers in the day wherein I led them out from the land of Egypt.\"[fn-20-P2081_709572:47-nf] Whence we understand that the coming cessation of the former circumcision l then given, and the coming procession of a new law (not such as He had already given to the fathers), are announced: just as Isaiah foretold, saying that in the last days the mount of the Lord and the house of God were to be manifest above the tops of the mounts: \"And it shall be exalted,\" he says, \"above the hills; and there shall come over it all nations; and many shall walk, and say, Come, ascend we unto the mount of the Lord, and unto the house of the God of Jacob,\"[fn-20-P2082_710202:48-nf] -not of Esau, the former son, but of Jacob, the second; that is, of our \"people,\" whose \"mount\" is Christ, \"prµcised without concisors' hands,[fn-20-P2083_710365:49-nf] filling every land,\" shown in the book of Daniel.[fn-20-P2084_710460:50-nf] In short, the coming procession of a new law out of this \"house of the God of Jacob\" Isaiah in the ensuing words announces, saying, \"For from Zion shall go out a law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem, and shall judge among the nations,\"-that is, among us, who have been called out of the nations,-\"and they shall join to beat their glaives into ploughs, and their lances into sickles; and nations shall not take up glaive against nation, and they shall no more learn to fight.\"[fn-20-P2085_710997:51-nf] Who else, therefore, are understood but we, who, fully taught by the new law, observe these practices,-the old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the action itself[fn-20-P2086_711198:52-nf] demonstrates? For the wont of the old law was to avenge itself by the vengeance of the glaive, and to pluck out \"eye for eye,\" and to inflict retaliatory revenge for injury.[fn-20-P2087_711420:53-nf] But the new law's wont was to point to clemency, and to convert to tranquillity the pristine ferocity of \"glaives\" and \"lances,\" and to remodel the pristine execution of \"war\" upon the rivals and foes of the law into the pacific actions of \"ploughing\" and \"tilling\" the land.[fn-20-P2088_711772:54-nf] Therefore as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal circumcision was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual circumcision has shone out into the voluntary obediences[fn-20-P2089_712090:55-nf] of peace.

We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

Yet further: premising \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" (the Law) adjoins, \"Thou shalt not kill.\" It honoured adultery, of course, to which it gives the precedence over murder, in the very fore-front of the most holy law, among the primary counts of the celestial edict, marking it with the inscription of the very principal sins. From its place you may discern the measure, from its rank the station, from its neighbourhood the merit, of each thing. Even evil has a dignity, consisting in being stationed at the summit, or else in the centre, of the superlatively bad. I behold a certain pomp and circumstance of adultery: on the one side, Idolatry goes before and leads the way; on the other, Murder follows in company. Worthily, without doubt, has she taken her seat between the two most conspicuous eminences of misdeeds, and has completely filled the vacant space, as it were, in their midst, with an equal majesty of crime. Enclosed by such flanks, encircled and supported by such ribs, who shall dislocate her from the corporate mass of coherencies, from the bond of neighbour crimes, from the embrace of kindred wickednesses, so as to set apart her alone for the enjoyment of repentance? Will not on one side Idolatry, on the other Murder, detain her, and (if they have any voice) reclaim: \"This is our wedge, this our compacting power? By (the standard of) Idolatry we are measured; by her disjunctive intervention we are conjoined; to her, outjutting from our midst, we are united; the Divine Scripture has made us concorporate; the very letters are our glue; herself can no longer exist without us. `Many and many a time do I, Idolatry, subminister occasion to Adultery; witness my groves and my mounts, and the living waters, and the very temples in cities, what mighty agents we are for overthrowing modesty.' `I also, Murder, sometimes exert myself on behalf of Adultery. To omit tragedies, witness nowadays the poisoners, witness the magicians, how many seductions I avenge, how many rivalries I revenge; how many guards, how many informers, how many accomplices, I make away with. Witness the midwives likewise, how many adulterous conceptions are slaughtered.' Even among Christians there is no adultery without us. Wherever the business of the unclean spirit is, there are idolatries; wherever a man, by being polluted, is slain, there too is murder. Therefore the remedial aids of repentance will not be suitable to them, or else they will likewise be to us. We either detain Adultery, or else follow her.\" These words the sins themselves do speak. If the sins are deficient in speech, hard by (the door of the church) stands an idolater, hard by stands a murderer; in their midst stands, too, an adulterer. Alike, as the duty of repentance bids, they sit in sackcloth and bristle in ashes; with the self-same weeping they groan; with the selfsame prayers they make their circuits; with the self-same knees they supplicate; the self-same mother they invoke. What doest thou, gentlest and humanest Discipline? Either to all these will it be thy duty so to be, for \"blessed are the peacemakers; \"[fn-13-P1343_373119:47-nf] or else, if not to all, it will be thy duty to range thyself on our side. Dost thou once for all condemn the idolater and the murderer, but take the adulterer out from their midst?-(the adulterer), the successor of the idolater, the predecessor of the murderer, the colleague of each? It is \"an accepting of person: \"[fn-13-P1344_373454:48-nf] the more pitiable repentances thou hast left (unpitied) behind!","title":"VII.

Just as, again, among all other crimes-nay, even before all others-when affirming that \"adulterers, and fornicators, and effeminates, and co-habitors with males, will not attain the kingdom of God,\" he premised, \"Do not err\"[fn-15-P1506_441376:165-nf] -to wit, if you think they will attain it. But to them from whom \"the kingdom\" is taken away, of course the life which exists in the kingdom is not permitted either. Moreover, by superadding, \"But such indeed ye have been; but ye have received ablution, but ye have been sanctified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God; \"[fn-15-P1507_441754:166-nf] in as far as he puts on the paid side of the account such sins before baptism, in so far after baptism he determines them irremissible, if it is true, (as it is), that they are not allowed to \"receive ablution\" anew. Recognise, too, in what follows, Paul (in the character of) an immoveable column of discipline and its rules: \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: God maketh a full end both of the one and of the others; but the body (is) not for fornication, but for God: \"[fn-15-P1508_442266:167-nf] for \"Let Us make man,\" said God, \"(conformable) to Our image and likeness.\" \"And God made man; (conformable) to the image and likeness of God made He him.\"[fn-15-P1509_442438:168-nf] \"The Lord for the body: \"yes; for \"the Word was made flesh.\"[fn-15-P1510_442528:169-nf] \"Moreover, God both raised up the Lord, and will raise up us through His own power; \"[fn-15-P1511_442633:170-nf] on account, to wit, of the union of our body with Him. And accordingly, \"Know ye not your bodies (to be) members of Christ? \"because Christ, too, is God's temple. \"Overturn this temple, and I will in three days' space resuscitate it.\"[fn-15-P1512_442890:171-nf] \"Taking away the members of Christ, shall I make (them) members of an harlot? Know ye not, that whoever is agglutinated to an harlot is made one body? (for the two shall be (made) into one flesh): but whoever is agglutinated to the Lord is one spirit? Flee fornication.\"[fn-15-P1513_443181:172-nf] If revocable by pardon, in what sense am I to flee it, to turn adulterer anew? I shall gain nothing if I do flee it: I shall be \"one body,\" to which by communion I shall be agglutinated. \"Every sin which a human being may have committed is extraneous to the body; but whoever fornicateth, sinneth against his own body.\"[fn-15-P1514_443526:173-nf] And, for fear you should fly to that statement for a licence to fornication, on the ground that you will be sinning against a thing which is yours, not the Lord's, he takes you away from yourself, and awards you, according to his previous disposition, to Christ: \"And ye are not your own; \"immediately opposing (thereto), \"for bought ye are with a price\"-the blood, to wit, of the Lord:[fn-15-P1515_443935:174-nf] \"glorify and extol the Lord in your body.\"[fn-15-P1516_444031:175-nf] See whether he who gives this injunction be likely to have pardoned one who has disgraced the Lord, and who has cast Him down from (the empire of) his body, and this indeed through incest. If you wish to imbibe to the utmost all knowledge of the apostle, in order to understand with what an axe of censorship he lops, and eradicates, and extirpates, every forest of lusts, for fear of permitting aught to regain strength and sprout again; behold him desiring souls to keep a fast from the legitimate fruit of nature-the apple, I mean, of marriage: \"But with regard to what ye wrote, good it is for a man to have no contact with a woman; but, on account of fornication, let each one have his own wife: let husband to wife, and wife to husband, render what is due.\"[fn-15-P1517_444834:176-nf] Who but must know that it was against his will that he relaxed the bond of this \"good,\" in order to prevent fornication? But if he either has granted, or does grant, indulgence to fornication, of course he has frustrated the design of his own remedy. and will be bound forthwith to put the curb upon the nuptials of continence, if the fornication for the sake of which those nuptials are permitted shall cease to be feared. For (a fornication) which has indulgence granted it will not be feared. And yet he professes that he has granted the use of marriage \"by way of indulgence, not of command.\"[fn-15-P1518_445455:177-nf] For he \"wills\" all to be on a level with himself. But when things lawful are (only) granted by way of indulgence, who hope for things unlawful? \"To the unmarried\" also, \"and widows,\" he says, \"It is good, by his example, to persevere\" (in their present state); \"but if they were too weak, to marry; because it is preferable to marry than to bum.\"[fn-15-P1519_445823:178-nf] With what fires, I pray you, is it preferable to \"burn\"-(the fires) of concupiscence, or (the fires) of penalty? Nay, but if fornication is pardonable, it will not be an object of concupiscence. But it is more (the manner) of an apostle to take forethought for the fires of penalty. Wherefore, if it is penalty which \"burns,\" it follows that fornication, which penalty awaits, is not pardonable. Meantime withal, while prohibiting divorce, he uses the Lord's precept against adultery as an instrument for providing, in place of divorce, either perseverance in widowhood, or else a reconciliation of peace: inasmuch as \"whoever shall have dismissed a wife (for any cause) except the cause of adultery, maketh her commit adultery; and he who marrieth one dismissed by a husband committeth adultery.\"[fn-15-P1520_446646:179-nf] What powerful remedies does the Holy Spirit furnish, to prevent, to wit, the commission anew of that which He wills not should anew be pardoned!","title":"VII.

Only it must be by the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, and not merely by our freedom of will. He goes on to quote also this passage: \"This Job had so effectually read these Scriptures, that cause he worshipped God purely with a mind unmixed with offences: now such worship of God is the proper work of righteousness.\"[fn-22-P2292_948485:186-nf] It is what not what he had brought to perfection in this world,-much less what he had done or perfected without the grace of that Saviour whom he had actually foretold.[fn-22-P2293_948681:187-nf] For that man, indeed, abstains from every wicked work, who does not allow the sin which he has within him to have dominion over him; and who, whenever an unworthy thought stole over him, suffered it not to come to a head in actual deed. It is, however, one thing not to have sin, and another to refuse obedience to its desires. It is one thing to fulfil the command, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-22-P2294_949093:188-nf] and another thing, by an endeavour at any rateafter abstinence, to do that which is also written, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-22-P2295_949247:189-nf] And yet one is quite aware that he can do nothing of all this without the Saviour's grace. It is to work righteousness, therefore, to fight in an internal struggle with the internal evil of concupiscence in the true worship of God; whilst to perfect it means to have no adversary at all. Now he who has to fight is still in danger, and is sometimes shaken, even if he is not overthrown; whereas he who has no enemy at all rejoices in perfect peace. He, moreover, is in the highest truth said to be without sin in whom no sin has an indwelling,-not he who, abstaining from evil deeds, uses such language as \"Now it is no longer I that do it, but the sin that dwelleth in me.\"[fn-22-P2296_949948:190-nf] ","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":80,"source_paragraph":"246","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"We have next a quotation of some words of the venerable presbyter Jerome, from his exposition of the passage where it is written: \"`Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.'[fn-23-P2332_959377:206-nf] These are they whom no consciousness of sin reproves,\" he says, and adds: \"The pure man is seen by his purity of hear; the temple of God cannot be defiled.\"[fn-23-P2333_959553:207-nf] This perfection is, to be sure, wrought in us by endeavour, by labour, by prayer, by effectual importunity therein that we may be brought to the perfection in which we may be able to look upon God with a pure heart, by His grace through our Lord Jesus Christ.

And I went along with the angel, and he brought me up into the heavens under the firmament; and I perceived and saw powers great and dreadful, full of wrath, and through the mouth of them a flame of fire coming out, and clothed in garments of fire. And I asked the angel: Who are these? And he said to me: These are they who are sent away to the souls of the sinners in the hour of necessity; for they have not believed that there is judgment and retribution. And I looked up into the heaven, and saw angels, whose faces shone like the sun, girded with golden girdles, having in their hands prizes, on which the name of the Lord was inscribed, full of all meekness and compassion. And I asked the angel: Who are these? And he answered and said to me: These are they who are sent forth in the day of the resurrection to bring the souls of the righteous,[fn-85-P8506_2745377:9-nf] who intrepidly walk according to God.[fn-85-P8507_2745441:10-nf] And I said to the angel: I wish to see the souls of the righteous and of the sinners, how they go out of the world. And the angel said to me: Look to the earth. And I looked, and saw the whole world as nothing disappearing before me. And I said to the angel: is this the greatness of men? And he said to me: Yes; for thus every unjust man disappears. And I looked, and saw a cloud of fire wrapped over all the world; and I said: What is this, my lord? And he said to me: This is the unrighteousness mingled with the destruction of the sinners. And I wept, and said to the angel: I wished to see the departures of the righteous and of the sinners, in what manner they go out of the world. And the angel says to me: Paul, look down, and see what thou hast asked. And I looked, and saw one of the sons of men falling near death. And the angel says to me: This is a righteous man, and, behold, all his works stand beside him in the hour of his necessity.[fn-85-P8508_2746414:11-nf] And there were beside him good angels, and along with them also evil angels. And the evil angels indeed found no place in him, but the good took possession of[fn-85-P8509_2746598:12-nf] the soul of the righteous man, and said to it: Take note of the body whence thou art coming out; for it is necessary for thee again to return to it in the day of the resurrection, that thou mayst receive what God hath promised to the righteous. And the good angels who had received the soul of the righteous man, saluted it, as being well known to them. And it went with them; and the Spirit came forth to meet them, saying: Come, soul, enter into the place of the resurrection, which God hath prepared for His righteous ones. And the angel said to me: Look down to the earth, and behold the soul of the impious, how it goes forth from its tabernacle, which has provoked God to anger, saying, Let us eat and drink;[fn-85-P8510_2747338:13-nf] for who is it that has gone down to Hades, and come up and announced that there is judgment and retribution? And take heed, and see all his works which he has done standing before him. And the evil angels came and the good. The good therefore found no place of rest in it, but the evil took possession of it, saying: O wretched soul, pay heed to thy flesh; take note of that whence thou art coming forth, for thou must return into thy flesh in the day of the resurrection, that thou mayst receive the recompense of thy sins. And when it had gone forth from its tabernacle, the angel who had lived along with it ran up to it, saying to it: O wretched soul, whither goest thou? I am he who each day wrote down thy sins. Thou hast destroyed the time of repentance; be exceedingly ashamed. And when it came, all the angels saw it, and cried out with one voice, saying: Woe to thee, wretched soul! what excuse hast thou come to give to God? And the angel of that soul said: Weep for it, all of you, along with me. And the angel came up, and worshipped the Lord, saying: Lord, behold the soul which has dwelt in wickedness in its time, and in its temporary life; do to it according to Thy decision. And there came a voice to that soul, saying: Where is the fruit of thy righteousness? And it was silent,[fn-85-P8511_2748671:14-nf] not being able to give an answer. And again there came a voice to it: He who has shown mercy will have mercy shown to him;[fn-85-P8512_2748815:15-nf] he who has not shown mercy will not have mercy shown to him. Let this soul be delivered to the merciless angel Temeluch, and let it be cast into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. And there was a voice as of tens of thousands, saying: Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and righteous is Thy judgment.[fn-85-P8513_2749153:16-nf] And moreover I saw, and, behold, another soul was led by an angel; and it wept, saying: Have mercy upon me, O righteous Judge, and deliver me from the hand of this angel, because he is dreadful and merciless. And a voice came to it. saying: Thou wast altogether merciless, and for this reason thou hast been delivered up to such an angel. Confess thy sins which thou hast done in the world. And that soul said: I have not sinned, O righteous Judge. And the Lord said to that soul: Verily thou seemest as if thou wert in the world, and weft hiding thy deeds from men. Knowest thou not that whensoever any one dies, his deeds run before him, whether they are good or evil? And when it heard this, it was silent. And I heard the Judge saying: Let the angel come, having in his hands the record of thy sins. And the Judge says to the angel: I say to thee the angel, Disclose all. Say what he has done five years before his death. By myself I swear to thee, that in the first period of his life there was forgetfulness of all his former sins. And the angel answered and said: Lord, command the souls to stand beside their angels; and that same hour they stood beside them. And the lord of that soul said: Take note of these souls, and whether thou hast in any way sinned against them. And it answered and said: Lord, a year has not been completed since I killed the one and lived with the other. And not only this, but I also wronged it. And the Lord said to it: Knowest thou not that he who wrongs any one in the world is kept, as soon as he dies, in the place until he whom he has wronged come, and both shall be judged before me, and each receive according to his works? And I heard a voice saying: Let this soul be delivered to the angel Tartaruch, and guarded till the great day of judgment.

And there were by the bank of the river, trees planted, full of different fruits. And I looked towards the rising of the sun, and I saw there trees of great size full of fruits; and that land was more brilliant than silver and gold; and there were vines growing on those date-palms, and myriads of shoots, and myriads of clusters on each branch. And I said to the archangel: What is this, my lord? And he says to me: This is the Acherusian lake, and within it the city of God. All are not permitted to enter into it, except whosoever shall repent of his sins; and as soon as he shall repent, and alter his life, he is delivered to Michael, and they cast him into the Acherusian lake, and then he brings him in the city of God, near the righteous.

If, then, the idea of humanityin Adam and Abel does not vary with the difference of their origin, neither the order nor the manner of their coming into existence making any difference in their nature, which is the same in both, according to the testimony of every one in his senses, and no one, not greatly needing treatment for insanity, would deny it; what necessity is there that against the divine nature we should admit this strange thought? Having heard of Father and Son from the Truth, we are taught in those two subjects the oneness of their nature; their natural relation to each other expressed by those names indicates that nature; and so do Our Lord's own words. For when He said, \"I and My Father are one[fn-8-P815_414598:120-nf] ,\" He conveys by that confession of a Father exactly the truth that He Himself is not a first cause, at the same time that He asserts by His union with the Father their common nature; so that these words of His secure our faith from the taint of heretical error on either side: for Sabellius has no ground for his confusion of the individuality of each Person, when the Only-begotten has so distinctly marked Himself off from the Father in those words, \"I and My Father;\" and Arius finds no confirmation of his doctrine of the strangeness of either nature to the other, since this oneness of both cannot admit distinction in nature. For that which is signified in these words by the oneness of Father and Son is nothing else but what belongs to them on the score of their actual being; all the other moral excellences which are to be observed in them as over and above[fn-8-P816_415486:121-nf] their nature may without error be set down as shared in by all created beings. For instance, Our Lord is called merciful and pitiful by the prophet[fn-8-P817_415668:122-nf] , and He wills us to be and to be called the same;. \"Be ye therefore merciful[fn-8-P818_415768:123-nf] ,\" and \"Blessed are the merciful[fn-8-P819_415821:124-nf] ,\" and many such passages. If, then, any one by diligence and attention has modelled himself according to the divine will, and become kind and pitiful and compassionate, or meek and lowly of heart, such as many of the saints are testified to have become in the pursuit of such excellences, does it follow that they are therefore one with God, or united to Him by virtue of any one of them? Not so. That which is not in every respect the same, cannot be `one' with him whose nature thus varies from it. Accordingly, a man becomes `one' with another, when in will, as our Lord says, they are `perfected into ones[fn-8-P820_416453:125-nf] ,' this union of wills being added to the connexion of nature. So also the Father and Son are one, the community of nature and the community of will running, in them, into one.

For as regards these last, you can urge none of these pleas. For ten farthings you there have swearing and forswearing. In fact, because the thunderbolt does not actually fall from heaven, because all things are not overthrown, you stand holding God in your bonds: to get a few vegetables, a pair of shoes, for a little matter of money, calling Him to witness. What is the meaning of this? Do not let us imagine, that because we are not punished, therefore we do not sin; this comes of God's mercy; not of our merit. Let your oath be an imprecation upon your own child, upon your own self: say, \"Else let the hangman lash my ribs.\" But you dare not. Is God less valuable than thy ribs? is He less precious than thy pate? Say \"Else let me be struck blind.\" But no. Christ so spares us, that He will not let us swear even by our own head; and yet we so little spare the honor of God, that on all occasions we must drag Him in! Ye know not what God is, and with what sort of lips he behooves to be invoked. Why, when we speak of any man of eminent worth, we say, \"First wash your mouth, and then make mention of him:\" and yet, that precious Name which is above every name, the Name which is marvellous in all the earth, the Name which devils hear and tremble, we haul about as we list! Oh! the force of habit! thereby has that Name become cheap. No doubt, if you impose on any one the necessity of coming into the sacred edifice to take his oath there, you feel that you have made the oath an awful one. And yet how is it that it seems awful in this way, but because we have been in the habit of using that at random, but not this? For ought not a shudder of awe to be felt when God is but named? But now, whereas among the Jews His Name was held to be so reverend, that it was written upon plates, and none was allowed to wear the characters except the high-priest alone: we bandy about His Name like any ordinary word. If simply to name God was not allowed to all; to call Him to witness, what audacity is it! nay, what madness! For if need were (rather than this)to fling away all that you have, ought you not readily to part with all? Behold, I solemnly declare and testify; reform these oaths of the forum, these superfluous oaths,[fn-5-P541_382995:32-nf] and bring to me all those who wish to take them. Behold, in the presence of this assembly, I charge those who are set apart for the tending of the Houses of Prayer, I exhort and issue this order to them, that no person be allowed to take such oaths at his own discretion: or rather, that none be allowed to swear in any other way, but that the person be brought to me, whosoever he be, since even for these matters less will not serve but they must needs come before us, just as if one had to do with little children. May there be no occasion! It is a shame in some things still to need to be taught. Do you dare to touch the Holy Table, being a person unbaptized? No, but what is still worse, you the baptized dare to lay your hand upon the Holy Table, which not even all ordained persons are allowed to touch, and so to take your oath. Now you would not go and lay your hand upon the head of your child,[fn-5-P542_385220:33-nf] and yet do you touch the Table, and not shudder, not feel afraid? Bring these men to me; I will judge, and send them away rejoicing, both the one and the other.[fn-5-P543_385856:34-nf] Do what you choose; I lay it down as a law that there be no swearing at all. What hope of salvation, while we thus make all to have been done in vain? Is this the end of your bills, and your bonds, that you should sacrifice your own soul? What gain do you get so great as the loss? Has he forsworn himself? You have undone both him and yourself. But has he not? even so still you have undone (both), by forcing him to transgress the commandment.[fn-5-P544_386545:35-nf] Let us cast out this disease from the soul: at any rate let us drive it out of the forum, out of our shops, out of our other work-places; our profits will but be the greater. Do not imagine that the success of your worldly plans is to be ensured by transgressions of the Divine laws. \"But he refuses to trust me,\" say you; and in fact I have sometimes heard this said by some: \"Unless I swear oaths without number, the man will not trust me.\" Yes, and for this you may thank yourself, because you are so off-hand with your oaths. For were it not so, but on the contrary were it clear to all men that you do not swear, take my word for it, you would be more readily believed upon your mere nod, than those are who swallow oaths by thousands. For look now: which do you more readily believe? me who do not swear, or those that do swear? \"Yes,\" say you, \"but then you are ruler and bishop.\" Then suppose I prove to you that it is not only for that reason? Answer me with truth, I beseech you; were I in the habit of perpetually swearing, would my office stand me in that stead? Not a whir. Do you see that it is not for this reason? And what do you gain at all? Answer me that. Paul endured hunger; do you then also choose to hunger rather than to transgress one of the commandments of God. Why are you so unbelieving? Here are you, ready to do and suffer all things for the sake of not swearing: and shall not He reward you? Shall He, Who sustains day by day both takers and breakers of oaths, give you over to hunger, when you have obeyed Him? Let all men see, that of those who assemble in this Church not one is a swearer. By this also let us become manifest, and not by our creed alone; let us have this mark also to distinguish us both from the Gentiles and from all men. Let us receive it as a seal from heaven, that we may everywhere be seen to be the King's own flock. By our mouth and tongue let us be known, in the first place, just as the barbarians are by theirs: even as those who speak Greek are distinguished from barbarians, so let us be known. Answer me: the birds which are said to be parrots, how are they known to be parrots? is it not by speaking like men? Let us then be known by speaking like the Apostles; by speaking like the Angels. If any one bid you swear tell him, \"Christ has spoken, and I do not swear.\" This is enough to make a way for all virtue to come in. It is a gate to religion, a high road leading to the philosophy of piety;[fn-5-P545_389143:36-nf] a kind of training-school. These things let us observe, that we may obtain also the future blessings, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, power and honor, now and ever, world without end.

Let us carefully observe what kind of defence he makes. \"There are passages,\" says he, \"which prove that man is commanded to be without sin.\" Now our answer to this is: Whether such commands are given is not at all the point in question, for the fact is clear enough; but whether the thing which is evidently commanded be itself at all possible of accomplishment in the body of this death, wherein \"the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, so that we cannot do the things that we would.\"[fn-24-P2499_1007674:49-nf] Now from this body of death not every one is liberated who ends the present life, but only he who in this life has received grace, and given proof of not receiving it in vain by spending his days in good works. For it is plainly one thing to depart from the body, which all men are obliged to do in the last day of their present life, and another to be delivered from the body of this death,-which God's grace alone, through our Lord Jesus Christ, imparts to His faithful saints. It is after this life, indeed, that the reward of perfection is bestowed, but only upon those by whom in their present life has been acquired the merit of such a recompense.

Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.'[fn-25-P2539_1018195:80-nf] And in another passage: `I shall be blameless with Him.'[fn-25-P2540_1018271:81-nf] And yet again: `Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'[fn-25-P2541_1018379:82-nf] To the same effect it is written in Solomon: `The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.'\"[fn-25-P2542_1018531:83-nf] Now some of these passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, \"Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.\"[fn-25-P2543_1019210:84-nf] So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"They likewise,\" says he, \"quote what the Saviour says: `Why callest thou me good?

Here are his remarks: \"We must answer this text with another, in which the same Lord says, `A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.'[fn-26-P2637_1044141:144-nf] And again: `He maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the evil.'[fn-26-P2638_1044231:145-nf] Then in another passage it is written, `For the good things are created from the beginning ;'[fn-26-P2639_1044345:146-nf] and yet again, `They that are good shall dwell in the land.'\"[fn-26-P2640_1044433:147-nf] Now to all this we must say in answer, that the passages in question must be understood in the same sense as the former one, \"There is none good, save one, that is, God.\" Either because all created things, although God made them very good, are yet, when compared with their Creator, not good, being in fact incapable of any comparison with Him. For in a transcendent, and yet very proper sense, He said of Himself, \"I Am that I Am.\"[fn-26-P2641_1044888:148-nf] The statement therefore before us, \"None is good save one, that is, God,\" is used in some such way as that which is said of John, \"He was not that light;\"[fn-26-P2642_1045063:149-nf] although the Lord calls him \"a lamp,\"[fn-26-P2643_1045119:150-nf] just as He says to His disciples: \"Ye are the light of the world: . . . neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel.\"[fn-26-P2644_1045400:151-nf] Still, in comparison with that light which is \"the true light which light every man that cometh into the world,\"[fn-26-P2645_1045537:152-nf] he was not light. Or else, because the very sons of God even, when compared with themselves as they shall hereafter become in their eternal perfection, are good in such a way that they still remain also evil.

Indeed, those men who say that there is no such directing faculty, have begun by supposing that the soul itself is simply a nonentity. One Dicµarchus, a Messenian, and amongst the medical profession Andreas and Asclepiades, have thus destroyed the (soul's) directing power, by actually placing in the mind the senses, for which they claim the ruling faculty. Asclepiades rides rough-shod over us with even this argument, that very many animals, after losing those parts of their body in which the soul's principle of vitality and sensation is thought mainly to exist, still retain life in a considerable degree, as well as sensation: as in the case of flies, and wasps, and locusts, when you have cut off their heads; and of she-goats, and tortoises, and eels, when you have pulled out their hearts. (He concludes), therefore, that there is no especial principle or power of the soul; for if there were, the soul's vigour and strength could not continue when it was removed with its domiciles (or corporeal organs). However, Dicµarchus has several authorities against him-and philosophers too-Plato, Strato, Epicurus, Democritus, Empedocles, Socrates, Aristotle; whilst in opposition to Andreas and Asclepiades (may be placed their brother) physicians Herophilus, Erasistratus, Diocles, Hippocrates, and Soranus himself; and better than all others, there are our Christian authorities. We are taught by God concerning both these questions-viz. that there is a ruling power in the soul, and that it is enshrined[fn-27-P2706_907462:96-nf] in one particular recess of the body.

It is only a ministering thing, and its ministration is not like that of a servant or familiar friend-animated and human beings; but rather that of a vessel, or something of that kind: it is body, not soul.

Accordingly the flesh is blamed in the Scriptures, because nothing is done by the soul without the flesh in operations of concupiscence, appetite, drunkenness, cruelty, idolatry, and other works of the flesh,-operations, I mean, which are not confined to sensations, but result in effects.

Now the party which aids in the commission of a crime is brought to trial, only in such a way that the principal offender who actually committed the crime may bear the weight of the penalty, although the abettor too does not escape indictment. Greater is the odium which falls on the principal, when his officials are punished through his fault.

Those, moreover, which evidently proceed neither from God, nor from diabolical inspiration, nor from the soul, being beyond the reach as well of ordinary expectation, usual interpretation, or the possibility of being intelligibly related, will have to be ascribed in a separate category to what is purely and simply the ecstatic state and its peculiar conditions.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":60,"source_paragraph":"183","folder":"ANF-03","text":"All souls, therefore; are shut up within Hades: do you admit this?

Why, then, cannot you suppose that the soul undergoes punishment and consolation in Hades in the interval, while it awaits its alternative of judgment, in a certain anticipation either of gloom or of glory?

What, then, is to take place in that interval? Shall we sleep? But souls do not sleep even when men are alive: it is indeed the business of bodies to sleep, to which also belongs death itself, no less than its mirror and counterfeit sleep. Or will you have it, that nothing is there done whither the whole human race is attracted, and whither all man's expectation is postponed for safe keeping? Do you think this state is a foretaste of judgment, or its actual commencement? a premature encroachment on it, or the first course in its full ministration? Now really, would it not be the highest possible injustice, even[fn-30-P3089_1119353:347-nf] in Hades, if all were to be still well with the guilty even there, and not well with the righteous even yet? What, would you have hope be still more confused after death? would you have it mock us still more with uncertain expectation? or shall it now become a review of past life, and an arranging of judgment, with the inevitable feeling of a trembling fear? But, again, must the soul always tarry for the body, in order to experience sorrow or joy? Is it not sufficient, even of itself, to suffer both one and the other of these sensations? How often, without any pain to the body, is the soul alone tortured by ill-temper, and anger, and fatigue, and very often unconsciously, even to itself? How often, too, on the other hand, amidst bodily suffering, does the soul seek out for itself some furtive joy, and withdraw for the moment from the body's importunate society? I am mistaken if the soul is not in the habit, indeed, solitary and alone, of rejoicing and glorifying over the very tortures of the body. Look for instance, at the soul of Mutius Scµvola as he melts his right hand over the fire; look also at Zeno's, as the torments of Dionysius pass over it.[fn-30-P3090_1120645:348-nf] The bites of wild beasts are a glory to young heroes, as on Cyrus were the scars of the bear.[fn-30-P3091_1120779:349-nf] Full well, then, does the soul even in Hades know how to joy and to sorrow even without the body; since when in the flesh it feels pain when it likes, though the body is unhurt; and when it likes it feels joy though the body is in pain. Now if such sensations occur at its will during life, how much rather may they not happen after death by the judicial appointment of God! Moreover, the soul executes not all its operations with the ministration of the flesh; for the judgment of God pursues even simple cogitations and the merest volitions. \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\"[fn-30-P3092_1121456:350-nf] Therefore, even for this cause it is most fitting that the soul, without at all waiting for the flesh, should be punished for what it has done without the partnership of the flesh. So, on the same principle, in return for the pious and kindly thoughts in which it shared not the help of the flesh, shall it without the flesh receive its consolation. Nay more,[fn-30-P3093_1121836:351-nf] even in matters done through the flesh the soul is the first to conceive them, the first to arrange them, the first to authorize them, the first to precipitate them into acts. And even if it is sometimes unwilling to act, it is still the first to treat the object which it means to effect by help of the body. In no case, indeed, can an accomplished fact be prior to the mental conception[fn-30-P3094_1122246:352-nf] thereof.

The discourse describes Wisdom as uttering certain sayings in her own person. Every student knows what is said in the passage[fn-13-P1337_720846:22-nf] where Wisdom makes counsel her dwelling-place, and calls to her knowledge and understanding, and says that she has as a possession strength and prudence (while she is herself called intelligence), and that she walks in the ways of righteousness and has her conversation in the ways of just judgement, and declares that by her kings reign, and princes write the decree of equity, and monarchs win possession of their own land. Now every one will see that the considerate reader will receive none of the phrases quoted without scrutiny according to the obvious sense. For if by her kings are advanced to their rule. and if from her monarchy derives its strength, it follows of necessity that Wisdom is displayed to us as a king-maker, and transfers to herself the blame of those who bear evil rule in their kingdoms. But we know of kings who in truth advance under the guidance of Wisdom to the rule that has no end-the poor in spirit, whose possession is the kingdom of heaven[fn-13-P1338_721882:23-nf] , as the Lord promises, Who is the Wisdom of the Gospel: and such also we recognize as the princes who bear rule over their passions, who are not enslaved by the dominion of sin, who inscribe the decree of equity upon their own life, as it were upon a tablet. Thus, too, that laudable despotism which changes, by the alliance of Wisdom, the democracy of the passions into the monarchy of reason, brings into bondage what were running unrestrained into mischievous liberty, I mean all carnal and earthly thoughts: for \"the flesh lusteth against the Spirit[fn-13-P1339_722457:24-nf] ,\" and rebels against the government of the soul.

And what could those persons fear or suffer in such affluence of blessings, where neither death nor ill-health was feared, and where nothing was wanting which a good will could desire, and nothing present which could interrupt man's mental or bodily enjoyment? Their love to God was unclouded, and their mutual affection was that of faithful and sincere marriage; and from this love flowed a wonderful delight, because they always enjoyed what was loved. Their avoidance of sin was tranquil; and, so long as it was maintained, no other ill at all could invade them and bring sorrow. Or did they perhaps desire to touch and eat the forbidden fruit, yet feared to die; and thus both fear and desire already, even in that blissful place, preyed upon those first of mankind? Away with the thought that such could be the case where there was no sin! And, indeed, this is already sin, to desire those things which the law of God forbids, and to abstain from them through fear of punishment, not through love of righteousness.

So far, my brother, as the question proposed by you is concerned, you have our opinion in answer and encouragement. But he who inquires whether persecution ought to be shunned by us must now be prepared to consider the following question also: Whether, if we should not flee from it, we should at least buy ourselves off from it. Going further than you expected, therefore, I will also on this point give you my advice, distinctly affirming that persecution, from which it is evident we must not flee, must in like manner not even be bought off. The difference lies in the payment; but as flight is a buying off without money, so buying off is money-flight. Assuredly you have here too the counselling of fear. Because you fear, you buy yourself off; and so you flee. As regards your feet, you have stood; in respect of the money you have paid, you have run away. Why, in this very standing of yours there was a fleeing from persecution, in the release from persecution which you bought; but that you should ransom with money a man whom Christ has ransomed with His blood, how unworthy is it of God and His ways of acting, who spared not His own Son for you, that He might be made a curse for us, because cursed is he that hangeth on a tree,[fn-19-P1990_603475:47-nf] -Him who was led as a sheep to be a sacrifice, and just as a lamb before its shearer, so opened He not His mouth;[fn-19-P1991_603623:48-nf] but gave His back to the scourges, nay, His cheeks to the hands of the smiter, and turned not away His face from spitting, and, being numbered with the transgressors, was delivered up to death, nay, the death of the cross. All this took place that He might redeem us from our sins. The sun ceded to us the day of our redemption; hell re-transferred the right it had in us, and our covenant is in heaven; the everlasting gates were lifted up, that the King of Glory, the Lord of might, might enter in,[fn-19-P1992_604143:49-nf] after having redeemed man from earth, nay, from hell, that he might attain to heaven. What, now, are we to think of the man who strives against that glorious One, nay, slights and defiles His goods, obtained at so great a ransom-no less, in truth, than His most precious blood? It appears, then, that it is better to flee than to fall in value, if a man will not lay out for himself as much as he cost Christ. And the Lord indeed ransomed him from the angelic powers which rule the world-from the spirits of wickedness, from the darkness of this life, from eternal judgment, from everlasting death. But you bargain for him with an informer, or a soldier or some paltry thief of a ruler-under, as they say, the folds of the tunic-as if he were stolen goods whom Christ purchased in the face of the whole world, yes, and set at liberty. Will you value, then, this free man at any price, and possess him at any price, but the one, as we have said, it cost the Lord,-namely, His own blood? (And if not,) why then do you purchase Christ in the man in whom He dwells, as though He were some human property? No otherwise did Simon even try to do, when he offered the apostles money for the Spirit of Christ. Therefore this man also, who in buying himself has bought the Spirit of Christ, will hear that word, \"Your money perish with you, since you have thought that the grace of God is to be had at a price!\"[fn-19-P1993_605563:50-nf] Yet who will despise him for being (what he is), a denier? For what says that extorter? Give me money: assuredly that he may not deliver him up, since he tries to sell you nothing else than that which he is going to give you for money. When you put that into his hands, it is certainly your wish not to be delivered up. But not delivered up, had you to be held up to public ridicule? While, then, in being unwilling to be delivered up, you are not willing to be thus exposed; by this unwillingness of yours you have denied that you are what you have been unwilling to have it made public that you are. Nay, you say, While I am unwilling to be held up to the public as being what I am, I have acknowledged that I am what I am unwilling to be so held up as being, that is, a Christian. Can Christ, therefore, claim that you, as a witness for Him, have stedfastly shown Him forth? He who buys himself off does nothing in that way. Before one it might, I doubt not, be said, You have confessed Him; so also, on the account of your unwillingness to confess Him before many you have denied Him. A man's very safety will pronounce that he has fallen while getting out of persecution's way. He has fallen, therefore, whose desire has been to escape. The refusal of martyrdom is denial. A Christian is preserved by his wealth, and for this end has his treasures, that he may not suffer, while he will be rich toward God. But it is the case that Christ was rich in blood for him. Blessed therefore are the poor, because, He says, the kingdom of heaven is theirs who have the soul only treasured up.[fn-19-P1994_607173:51-nf] If we cannot serve God and mammon, can we be redeemed both by God and by mammon? For who will serve mammon more than the man whom mammon has ransomed? Finally, of what example do you avail yourself to warrant your averting by money the giving of you up? When did the apostles, dealing with the matter, in any time of persecution trouble, extricate themselves by money? And money they certainly had from the prices of lands which were laid down at their feet,[fn-19-P1995_607649:52-nf] there being, without a doubt, many of the rich among those who believed-men, and also women, who were wont, too, to minister to their comfort. When did Onesimus, or Aquila, or Stephen,[fn-19-P1996_607856:53-nf] give them aid of this kind when they were persecuted? Paul indeed, when Felix the governor hoped that he should receive money for him from the disciples,[fn-19-P1997_608052:54-nf] about which matter he also dealt with the apostle in private, certainly neither paid it himself, nor did the disciples for him. Those disciples, at any rate. who wept because he was equally persistent in his determination to go to Jerusalem, and neglectful of all means to secure himself from the persecutions which had been foretold as about to occur there, at last say, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was that will? No doubt that he should suffer for the name of the Lord, not that he should be bought off. For as Christ laid down His life for us, so, too, we should do for Him; and not only for the Lord Himself, nay, but likewise for our brethren on His account. This, too, is the teaching of John when he declares, not that we should pay for our brethren, but rather that we should die for them. It makes no difference whether the thing not to be done by you is to buy off a Christian, or to buy one. And so the will of God accords with this. Look at the condition-certainly of God's ordaining, in whose hand the king's heart is-of kingdoms and empires. For increasing the treasury there are daily provided so many appliances-registerings of property, taxes in kind benevolences, taxes in money; but never up to this time has ought of the kind been provided by bringing Christians under some purchase-money for the person and the sect, although enormous gains could be reaped from numbers too great for any to be ignorant of them. Bought with blood, paid for with blood, we owe no money for our head, because Christ is our Head. It is not fit that Christ should cost us money. How could martyrdoms, too, take place to the glory of the Lord, if by tribute we should pay for the liberty of our sect? And so he who stipulates to have it at a price, opposes the divine appointment. Since, therefore, Caesar has imposed nothing on us after this fashion of a tributary sect-in fact, such an imposition never can be made,-with Antichrist now close at hand, and gaping for the blood, not for the money of Christians-how can it be pointed out to me that there is the command, \"Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's? \"[fn-19-P1998_610207:55-nf] A soldier, be he an informer or an enemy, extorts money from me by threats, exacting nothing on Caesar's behalf; nay, doing the very opposite, when for a bribe he lets me go-Christian as I am, and by the laws of man a criminal. Of another sort is the denarius which I owe to Caesar, a thing belonging to him, about which the question then was started, it being a tribute coin due indeed by those subject to tribute, not by children. Or how shall I render to God the things which are God's,-certainly, therefore, His own likeness and money inscribed with His name, that is, a Christian man? But what do I owe God, as I do Caesar the denarius, but the blood which His own Son shed for me? Now if I owe God, indeed, a human being and my own blood; but I am now in this juncture, that a demand is made upon me for the payment of that debt, I am undoubtedly guilty of cheating God if I do my best to withhold payment. I have well kept the commandment, if, rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, I refuse to God the things which are God's!","title":"IX.

But also to every one who asks me I will give on the plea of charity, not under any intimidation. Who asks?[fn-20-P2000_611385:56-nf] He says. But he who uses intimidation does not ask. One who threatens if he does not receive, does not crave, but compels. It is not alms he looks for, who comes not to be pitied, but to be feared. I will give, therefore, because I pity, not because I fear, when the recipient honours God and returns me his blessing; not when rather he both believes that he has conferred a favour on me, and, beholding his plunder, says, \"Guilt money.\" Shall I be angry even with an enemy? But enmities have also other grounds. Yet withal he did not say a, betrayer, or persecutor, or one seeking to terrify you by his threats. For how much more shall I heap coals upon the head of a man of this sort, if I do not redeem myself by money? \"In like manner,\" says Jesus, \"to him who has taken away your coat, grant even your cloak also.\" But that refers to him who has sought to take away my property, not my faith. The cloak, too, I will grant, if I am not threatened with betrayal. If he threatens, I will demand even my coat back again. Even now, the declarations of the Lord have reasons and laws of their own. They are not of unlimited or universal application. And so He commands us to give to every one who asks, yet He Himself does not give to those who ask a sign. Otherwise, if you think that we should give indiscriminately to all who ask, that seems to me to mean that you would give, I say not wine to him who has a fever, but even poison or a sword to him who longs for death. But how we are to understand,\" Make to yourselves friends of mammon,\"[fn-20-P2001_612946:57-nf] let the previous parable teach you. The saying was addressed to the Jewish people; inasmuch as, having managed ill the business of the Lord which had been entrusted to them, they ought to have provided for themselves out of the men of mammon, which we then were, friends rather than enemies, and to have delivered us from the dues of sins which kept us from God, if they bestowed the blessing upon us, for the reason given by the Lord, that when grace began to depart from them, they, betaking themselves to our faith, might be admitted into everlasting habitations. Hold now any other explanation of this parable and saying you like, if only you clearly see that there is no likelihood of our opposers, should we make them friends with mammon, then receiving us into everlasting abodes. But of what will not cowardice convince men? As if Scripture both allowed them to flee, and commanded them to buy off! Finally, it is not enough if one or another is so rescued. Whole Churches have imposed tribute en masse on themselves. I know not whether it is matter for grief or shame when among hucksters, and pickpockets, and bath-thieves, and gamesters, and pimps, Christians too are included as taxpayers in the lists of free soldiers and spies. Did the apostles, with so much foresight, make the office of overseer of this type, that the occupants might be able to enjoy their rule free from anxiety, under colour of providing (a like freedom for their flocks)? For such a peace, forsooth, Christ, returning to His Father, commanded to be bought from the soldiers by gifts like those you have in the Saturnalia!","title":"IX.

Caution is more easy where danger is manifest, and the mind is prepared beforehand for the contest when the adversary avows himself.

Accordingly, the word that sounds outwardly is the sign of the word that gives light inwardly; which latter has the greater claim to be called a word. For that which is uttered with the mouth of the flesh, is the articulate sound of a word; and is itself also called a word, on account of that to make which outwardly apparent it is itself assumed. For our word is so made in some way into an articulate sound of the body, by assuming that articulate sound by which it may be manifested to men's senses, as the Word of God was made flesh, by assuming that flesh in which itself also might be manifested to men's senses. And as our word becomes an articulate sound, yet is not changed into one; so the Word of God became flesh, but far be it from us to say He was changed into flesh, For both that word of ours became an articulate sound, and that other Word became flesh, by assuming it, not by consuming itself so as to be changed into it. And therefore whoever desires to arrive at any likeness, be it of what sort it may, of the Word of God, however in many respects unlike, must not regard the word of ours that, sounds in the ears, either when it is uttered in an articulate sound or when it is silently thought. For the words of all tongues that are uttered in sound are also silently thought, and the mind runs over verses while the bodily mouth is silent. And not only the numbers of syllables, but the tunes also of songs, since they are corporeal, and pertain to that sense of the body which is called hearing, are at hand by certain incorporeal images appropriate to them, to those who think of them, and who silently revolve all these things. But we must pass by this, in order to arrive at that word of man, by the likeness of which, be it of what sort it may, the Word of God may be somehow seen as in an enigma. Not that word which was spoken to this or that prophet, and of which it is said, \"Now the word of God grew and multiplied;\"[fn-19-P1983_1000529:43-nf] and again, \"Faith then cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ;\"[fn-19-P1984_1000625:44-nf] and again, \"When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men but, as it is in truth, the word of God\"[fn-19-P1985_1000788:45-nf] (and there are countless other like sayings in the Scriptures respecting the word of God, which is disseminated in the sounds of many and diverse languages through the hearts and mouths of men; and which is therefore called the word of God, because the doctrine thai is delivered is not human, but divine);-but we are now seeking to see, in whatsoever way we can, by means of this likeness, that Word of God of which it is said, \"The Word was God;\" of which it is said, \"All things were made by Him;\" of which it is said, \"The Word became flesh;\" of which it is said \"The Word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom.\"[fn-19-P1986_1001430:46-nf] We must go on, then, to that word of man, to the word of the rational animal, to the word of that image of God, that is not born of God, but made by God; which is neither utterable in sound nor capable of being thought under the likeness of sound such as must needs be with the word of any tongue; but which precedes all the signs by which it is signified, and is begotten from the knowledge that continues in the mind, when that same knowledge is spoken inwardly according as it really is. For the sight of thinking is exceedingly like the sight of knowledge. For when it is uttered by sound, or by any bodily sign, it is not uttered according as it really is, but as it can be seen or heard by the body. When, therefore, that is in the word which is in the knowledge, then there is a true word, and truth, such as is looked for from man; such that what is in the knowledge is also in the word, and what is not in the knowledge is also not in the word. Here may be recognized, \"Yea, yea; nay, nay.\"[fn-19-P1987_1002449:47-nf] And so this likeness of the image that is made, approaches as nearly as is possible to that likeness of the image that is born, by which God the Son is declared to be in all things like in substance to the Father. We must notice in this enigma also another likeness of the word of God; viz. that, as it is said of that Word, \"All things were made by Him,\" where God is declared to have made the universe by His only-begotten Son, so there are no works of man that are not first spoken in his heart: whence it is written, \"A word is the beginning of every work.\"[fn-19-P1988_1003029:48-nf] But here also, it is when the word is true, that then it is the beginning of a good work. And a word is true when it is begotten from the knowledge of working good works, so that there too may be preserved the \"yea yea, nay nay;\" in order that whatever is in that knowledge by which we are to live, may be also in the word by which we are to work, and whatever is not in the one may not be in the other. Otherwise such a word will be a lie, not truth; and what comes thence will be a sin, and not a good work. There is yet this other likeness of the Word of God in this likeness of our word, that there can be a word of ours with no work following it, but there cannot be any work unless a word precedes; just as the Word of God could have existed though no creature existed, but no creature could exist unless by that Word by which all things are made. And therefore not God the Father, not the Holy Spirit, not the Trinity itself, but the Son only, which is the Word of God, was made flesh; although the Trinity was the maker: in order that we might live rightly through our word following and imitating His example, i.e. by having no lie in either the thought or the work of our word. But this perfection of this image is one to be at some time hereafter. In order to attain this it is that the good master teaches us by Christian faith, and by pious doctrine, that \"with face unveiled\" from the veil of the law, which is the shadow of things to come, \"beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,\" i.e. gazing at it through a glass, \"we may be transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord;\"[fn-19-P1989_1004688:49-nf] as we explained above.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"23. The Word of God, then, the only-begotten Son of the Father, in all things like and equal to the Father, God of God, Light of Light, Wisdom of Wisdom, Essence of Essence, is altogether that which the Father is, yet is not the Father, because the one is Son, the other is Father. And hence He knows all that the Father knows; but to Him to know, as to be, is from the Father, for to know and to be is there one. And therefore, as to be is not to the Father from the Son, so neither is to know. Accordingly, as though uttering Himself, the Father begat the Word equal to Himself in all things; for He would not have uttered Himself wholly and perfectly, if there were in His Word anything more or less than in Himself. And here that is recognized in the highest sense, \"Yea, yea; nay, nay.\"[fn-20-P2007_1017375:56-nf] And therefore this Word is truly truth, since whatever is in that knowledge from which it is born is also in itself and whatever is not in that knowledge is not in the Word.

For \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.\"[fn-20-P2008_1017740:57-nf] Through power He cannot do this; nor is it infirmity, but strength, by which truth cannot be false. Therefore God the Father knows all things in Himself, knows all things in the Son; but in Himself as though Himself, in the Son as though His own Word which Word is spoken concerning all those things that are in Himself. Similarly the Son knows all things, viz. in Himself, as things which are born of those which the Father knows in Himself, and in the Father, as those of which they are born, which the Son Himself knows in Himself. The Father then, and the Son know mutually; but the one by begetting, the other by being born. And each of them sees simultaneously all things that are in their knowledge, in their wisdom, in their essence: not by parts or singly, as though by alternately looking from this side to that, and from that side to this, and again from this or that object to this or that object, so as not to be able to see some things without at the same time not seeing others; but, as I said, sees all things simultaneously, whereof there is not one that He does not always see.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_24_the_prescription_against_heretics_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Besides which, it must have followed, that, for the man to whom he committed the ministration of the gospel, he would add the injunction that it be not ministered in all places,[fn-34-P3484_1196239:277-nf] and without respect to persons,[fn-34-P3485_1196286:278-nf] in accordance with the Lord's saying, \"Not to cast one's pearls before swine, nor that which is holy unto dogs.\"[fn-34-P3486_1196421:279-nf] Openly did the Lord speak,[fn-34-P3487_1196469:280-nf] without any intimation of a hidden mystery.

But every liar says the opposite of what he thinks in his heart, with purpose to deceive. Now it is evident that speech was given to man, not that men might therewith deceive one another, but that one man might make known his thoughts to another. To use speech, then, for the purpose of deception, and not for its appointed end, is a sin. Nor are we to suppose that there is any lie that is not a sin, because it is sometimes possible, by telling a lie, to do service to another. For it is possible to do this by theft also, as when we steal from a rich man who never feels the loss, to give to a poor man who is sensibly benefited by what he gets. And the same can be said of adultery also, when, for instance, some woman appears likely to die of love unless we consent to her wishes, while if she lived she might purify herself by repentance; but yet no one will assert that on this account such an adultery is not a sin. And if we justly place so high a value upon chastity, what offense have we taken at truth, that, while no prospect of advantage to another will lead us to violate the former by adultery, we should be ready to violate the latter by lying?

Surely, if no Christian will dare to say this, \"It is not of God that showeth mercy, but of man that willeth,\" lest he should openly contradict the apostle, it follows that the true interpretation of the saying, \"It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,\" is that the whole work belongs to God, who both makes the will of man righteous, and thus prepares it for assistance, and assists it when it is prepared.

It is possible, I say, that this might not have been considered a sin, had the apostle not added: \"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.\"[fn-25-P2586_1224811:163-nf] Who, then, can deny that it is a sin, when confessedly it is only by apostolic authority that permission is granted to those who do it? Another case of the same kind is where he says: \"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?\"[fn-25-P2587_1225148:164-nf] And shortly afterwards: \"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church. I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.\"[fn-25-P2588_1225519:165-nf] Now it might have been supposed in this case that it is not a sin to have a quarrel with another, that the only sin is in wishing to have it adjudicated upon outside the Church, had not the apostle immediately added: \"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law with one another.\"[fn-25-P2589_1225850:166-nf] And lest any one should excuse himself by saying that he had a just cause, and was suffering wrong, and that he only wished the sentence of the judges to remove his wrong, the apostle immediately anticipates such thoughts and excuses, and says: \"Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?\" Thus bringing us back to our Lord's saying, \"If any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;\"[fn-25-P2590_1226343:167-nf] and again, \"Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.\"[fn-25-P2591_1226431:168-nf] Therefore our Lord has forbidden His followers to go to law with other men about worldly affairs. And carrying out this principle, the apostle here declares that to do so is \"altogether a fault.\" But when, notwithstanding, he grants his permission to have Such cases between brethren decided in the Church, other brethren adjudicating, and only sternly forbids them to be carried outside the Church, it is manifest that here again an indulgence is extended to the infirmities of the weak. It is in view, then, of these sins, and others of the same sort, and of others again more trifling still, which consist of offenses in words and thought (as the Apostle James confesses, \"In many things we offend all\"[fn-25-P2592_1227157:169-nf] ), that we need to pray every day and often to the Lord, saying, \"Forgive us our debts,\" and to add in truth and sincerity, \"as we forgive our debtors.\"","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":81,"source_paragraph":"296","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Again, there are some sins which would be considered very trifling, if the Scriptures did not show that they are really very serious.

But whatever is done either through fear of punishment or from some other carnal motive, and has not for its principle that love which the Spirit of God sheds abroad in the heart, is not done as it ought to be done, however it may appear to men. For this love embraces both the love of God and the love of our neighbor, and \"on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets,\"[fn-27-P2789_1287934:237-nf] we may add the Gospel and the apostles. For it is from these that we hear this voice: The end of the commandment is charity, and God is love.[fn-27-P2790_1288116:238-nf] Wherefore, all God's commandments, one of which is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\"[fn-27-P2791_1288237:239-nf] and all those precepts which are not commandments but special counsels, one of which is, \"It is good for a man not to touch a woman,\"[fn-27-P2792_1288414:240-nf] are rightly carried out only when the motive principle of action is the love of God, and the love of our neighbor in God. And this applies both to the present and the future life. We love God now by faith, then we shall love Him through sight. Now we love even our neighbor by faith; for we who are ourselves mortal know not the hearts of mortal men. But in the future life, the Lord \"both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God;\"[fn-27-P2793_1288974:241-nf] for every man shall love and praise in his neighbor the virtue which, that it may not be hid, the Lord Himself shall bring to light. Moreover, lust diminishes as love grows, till the latter grows to such a height that it can grow no higher here. For \"greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"[fn-27-P2794_1289329:242-nf] Who then can tell how great love shall be in the future world, when there shall be no lust for it to restrain and conquer? for that will be the perfection of health when there shall be no struggle with death.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_16_letter_ii_a_letter_of_sulpitius_severus_to_his_sister_claudia_concerning_virginity_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"I believe that I have now set forth, briefly indeed, but, at the same time, fully, what is implied in a woman's purity of body: it remains that we should learn what it is to be pure also in spirit; i.e. that what it is unlawful for one to do in act, it is also unlawful for one even to imagine in thought.

Whatever good thing we may have, let us impart to them: let us not pass them by, in our acts of beneficence. For if we ought, by suffering ill, to sate their rage, much more, by doing them good: for this is a less thing than the other. For it is not all alike, to do good to an enemy, and to be willing to suffer greater wrongs than he wishes (to inflict):[fn-6-P690_557855:20-nf] from the one we shall come on to the other. This is the dignity of Christ's disciples. Those crucified Him, when He had come for the very purpose of doing them good; His disciples they scourged; and after all this, He admits them to the same honor with His disciples, making them equally partakers of His gifts. I beseech you, let us be imitators of Christ: in this regard it is possible to imitate Him: this makes a man like unto God: this is more than human. Let us hold fast to Mercy: she is the schoolmistress and teacher of that higher Wisdom. He that has learnt to show mercy to the distressed, will learn also not to resent injuries; he that has learnt this, will be able to do good even to his enemies. Let us learn to feel for the ills our neighbors suffer, and we shall learn to endure the ills they inflict. Let us ask the person himself who ill-treats us, whether he does not condemn himself? would he not be glad to show a nobler spirit (filosofein)? must he not own that his behavior is nothing but passion, that it is little-minded, pitiful? would he not like to be of those who are wronged and are silent, and not of those who do wrong, and are beside themselves with passion? can he go away not admiring the patient sufferer? Do not imagine that this makes men despicable. Nothing makes men so despicable, as insolent and injurious behavior: nothing makes men so respectable, as endurance under insolence and injury. For the one is a ruffian, the other a philosopher; the one is less than man, the other is equal to angels. For though he be inferior to the wrong-doer,yet, for all that, he has the power, if he had the mind, to be revenged. And besides, the one is pitied by all, the other hated. What then? The former will be much the better of the two: for everybody will treat the one as a madman, the other as a man of sense. He[fn-6-P691_560217:21-nf] cannot speak of him in evil sort: yea, thou fearest, says one, lest perchance he be not such (as thou wouldest represent). Best that thou speak not evil in thy thought even; next, that thou speak it not to another. Pray not then to God against this man: if thou hear him evil-spoken of, take his part: say, It was passion that spoke such words, not the man; say, It was anger not my friend: his madness, not his heart. Thus let us account of each offence. Wait not for the fire to be kindled, but check it before it comes to that: do not exasperate the savage beast, rather do not suffer it to become exasperated: for thou wilt no longer be able to check it, if once the flame be kindled. For what has the man called thee? \"Thou feel and simpleton.\" And which then is liable to the name? the called, or the caller? For the one, be he ever so wise, gets the character of being a feel: but the other, even if he be a simpleton, gets credit for being wise, and of philosophic temper. Say, which is the simpleton? he who alleges against another what is untrue, or he who even under such treatment is unmoved? For if it be the mark of true philosophy to be unmoved however moved; to fall into a passion when none moves to anger-what folly is it! I say not yet, how sore a manner of punishment is in store for those who utter such reproaches and revilings against their neighbor. But how? has he called thee \"a low fellow and low-born, a sorry creature and of sorry extraction?\" Again he has turned the taunt against himself. For the other will appear worthy and respectable, but he a sorry creature indeed: for to cast up such things, that is to say, meanness of birth, as a disgrace. is little-minded indeed: while the other will be thought a great and admirable character, because he thinks nothing of such a taunt, and is no more affected by it than if he were told[fn-6-P692_563131:22-nf] that he had about him any other ordinary and quite indifferent circumstance. But does he call thee \"adulterer,\" and such like? At this thou mayest even laugh: for, when the conscience is not smitten, there can be no occasion for wrath. * * For when one has considered what bad and disgraceful disclosures he makes, still for all that, there is no need to grieve. He has but laid bare now, what everybody must be apprised of by and bye: meanwhile, as regards himself he has shown all men that he is not to be trusted, for that he knows not how to screen his neighbor's faults: he has disgraced himself more than he has the other; has stopped up against himself every harbor: has made terrible to himself the bar at which he must hereafter be tried. For not the person (whose secrets are betrayed) will be the object of everybody's aversion, but he, who where he ought not to have raised the veil, has stripped off the clothes. But speak thou nothing of the secrets thou knowest: hold thou thy peace if thou wouldest bear off the good fame. For not only wilt thou overthrow what has been spoken, and hide it: but thou wilt also bring about another capital result: thou wilt stop sentence being given against thyself. Does somebody speak evil of thee? Say thou \"Had he known all, he would not have spoken only thus much.\"-So you admire what has been said, and are delighted with it? Aye, but you must follow it. For when we tell you all[fn-6-P693_565000:23-nf] these maxims of the heathen moralists, it is not because Scripture does not contain hundreds of such sayings, but because these are of more force to put you to the blush. As in fact Scripture itself is wont to use this appeal to our sense of shame; for, instance, when it says, \"Do ye even as the heathen.\" (Jer. xxxv. 3.) And the prophet Jeremiah brought forward into public view the children of Rechab, how they would not consent to violate the command of their father.-Miriam and her company spake evil of Moses, and he immediately begged them off from their punishment; nay, would not so much as let it be known that his cause was avenged. (Num. ch. xii.) But not so we: on the contrary, this is what we most desire; to have all men know that they have not passed unpunished. How long shall we breathe of the earth?-One party cannot make a fight. Pluck the madmen from both sides, you will exasperate them the more: but pluck from right or from left, and you have quenched the passion. The striker, if he has to do with one who will not put up with blows, is the more set on: but if with one who yields, he is the sooner unnerved, and his blow is spent upon himself. For no practised pugilist so unnerves the strength of his antagonist, as does a man who being injuriously treated makes no return. For the other only goes off ashamed, and condemned, first by his own conscience, and secondly by all the lookers on. And there is a proverb too, which says, that \"to honor another, is to honor one's self\": therefore also to abuse another is to abuse one's self. None, I repeat, will be able to harm us, unless we harm ourselves; nor will any make me poor, unless I make myself such. For come, let us look at it in this way. Suppose that I have a beggarly soul, and let all lavish all their substance upon me, what of that? So long as the soul is not changed, it is all in vain. Suppose I have a noble soul, and let all men take from me my substance: what of that? So long as you do not make the soul beggarly, no harm is done. Suppose my life be impure, and let all men say just the contrary of me: what of that? For though they say it, yet they do not judge thus of me in their heart. Again, suppose my life be pure, and let all say of me just the reverse: and what of that? For in their own conscience they will condemn themselves: since they are not persuaded of what they say. Just as we ought not to admit the praise, so neither the criminations. And why say I these things? None will ever be able to plot against us, nor lay us under any evil charge, if we choose (that they shall not). For how now, I ask you? Let him drag me into a court of justice, let him lay vexatious informations, let him, if you will, have the very soul out of me: and what of that? for a little while, undeservedly to suffer these things, what does it signify? \"Well,[fn-6-P694_568111:24-nf] but this,\" say you, \"is of itself an evil.\" Well, but of itself this is a good, to suffer undeservedly. What? would you have the suffering to be deserved? Let me mention again a piece of philosophy, from one of the sages. A certain person, says the story, had been put to death. And one of the sage's disciples said to him, \"Woe is me, that he should have suffered unjustly!\" The other turned upon him, \"Why, how now?\" said he, \"would you have had him justly suffer?\" (Socrates ap. Diog. Laert. and Xen. Mem. Socr.) John also, was not he unjustly put to death? Which then do you rather pity: them that justly suffer death, or [him?[fn-6-P695_569532:25-nf] Do you not count them miserable, while] him you even admire? Then what is a man injured, when from death itself he has got great gain, not merely no hurt? If indeed the man had been immortal, and this made him mortal, no doubt it would be a hurt: but if he be mortal, and in the course of nature must expect death a little later, and his enemy has but expedited his death, and glory with it, what is the harm? Let us but have our soul in good order, and there will be no harm from without. But thou art not in a condition of glory? And what of that? That which is true of wealth, the same holds for glory: if I be magnanimous (megaloprephj), I shall need none; if vainglorious, the more I get, the more I shall want. In this way shall I most become illustrious, and obtain greater glory; namely, if I despise glory. Knowing these things, let us be thankful to Him Who hath freely given us such a life, and let us ensue it unto His glory; for to Him belongs the glory, forever. Amen.","title":"Homily XIV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":5,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_21_homily_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Him therefore let us also imitate.

Whatever good thing we may have, let us impart to them: let us not pass them by, in our acts of beneficence. For if we ought, by suffering ill, to sate their rage, much more, by doing them good: for this is a less thing than the other. For it is not all alike, to do good to an enemy, and to be willing to suffer greater wrongs than he wishes (to inflict):[fn-6-P690_557855:20-nf] from the one we shall come on to the other. This is the dignity of Christ's disciples. Those crucified Him, when He had come for the very purpose of doing them good; His disciples they scourged; and after all this, He admits them to the same honor with His disciples, making them equally partakers of His gifts. I beseech you, let us be imitators of Christ: in this regard it is possible to imitate Him: this makes a man like unto God: this is more than human. Let us hold fast to Mercy: she is the schoolmistress and teacher of that higher Wisdom. He that has learnt to show mercy to the distressed, will learn also not to resent injuries; he that has learnt this, will be able to do good even to his enemies. Let us learn to feel for the ills our neighbors suffer, and we shall learn to endure the ills they inflict. Let us ask the person himself who ill-treats us, whether he does not condemn himself? would he not be glad to show a nobler spirit (filosofein)? must he not own that his behavior is nothing but passion, that it is little-minded, pitiful? would he not like to be of those who are wronged and are silent, and not of those who do wrong, and are beside themselves with passion? can he go away not admiring the patient sufferer? Do not imagine that this makes men despicable. Nothing makes men so despicable, as insolent and injurious behavior: nothing makes men so respectable, as endurance under insolence and injury. For the one is a ruffian, the other a philosopher; the one is less than man, the other is equal to angels. For though he be inferior to the wrong-doer,yet, for all that, he has the power, if he had the mind, to be revenged. And besides, the one is pitied by all, the other hated. What then? The former will be much the better of the two: for everybody will treat the one as a madman, the other as a man of sense. He[fn-6-P691_560217:21-nf] cannot speak of him in evil sort: yea, thou fearest, says one, lest perchance he be not such (as thou wouldest represent). Best that thou speak not evil in thy thought even; next, that thou speak it not to another. Pray not then to God against this man: if thou hear him evil-spoken of, take his part: say, It was passion that spoke such words, not the man; say, It was anger not my friend: his madness, not his heart. Thus let us account of each offence. Wait not for the fire to be kindled, but check it before it comes to that: do not exasperate the savage beast, rather do not suffer it to become exasperated: for thou wilt no longer be able to check it, if once the flame be kindled. For what has the man called thee? \"Thou feel and simpleton.\" And which then is liable to the name? the called, or the caller? For the one, be he ever so wise, gets the character of being a feel: but the other, even if he be a simpleton, gets credit for being wise, and of philosophic temper. Say, which is the simpleton? he who alleges against another what is untrue, or he who even under such treatment is unmoved? For if it be the mark of true philosophy to be unmoved however moved; to fall into a passion when none moves to anger-what folly is it! I say not yet, how sore a manner of punishment is in store for those who utter such reproaches and revilings against their neighbor. But how? has he called thee \"a low fellow and low-born, a sorry creature and of sorry extraction?\" Again he has turned the taunt against himself. For the other will appear worthy and respectable, but he a sorry creature indeed: for to cast up such things, that is to say, meanness of birth, as a disgrace. is little-minded indeed: while the other will be thought a great and admirable character, because he thinks nothing of such a taunt, and is no more affected by it than if he were told[fn-6-P692_563131:22-nf] that he had about him any other ordinary and quite indifferent circumstance. But does he call thee \"adulterer,\" and such like? At this thou mayest even laugh: for, when the conscience is not smitten, there can be no occasion for wrath. * * For when one has considered what bad and disgraceful disclosures he makes, still for all that, there is no need to grieve. He has but laid bare now, what everybody must be apprised of by and bye: meanwhile, as regards himself he has shown all men that he is not to be trusted, for that he knows not how to screen his neighbor's faults: he has disgraced himself more than he has the other; has stopped up against himself every harbor: has made terrible to himself the bar at which he must hereafter be tried. For not the person (whose secrets are betrayed) will be the object of everybody's aversion, but he, who where he ought not to have raised the veil, has stripped off the clothes. But speak thou nothing of the secrets thou knowest: hold thou thy peace if thou wouldest bear off the good fame. For not only wilt thou overthrow what has been spoken, and hide it: but thou wilt also bring about another capital result: thou wilt stop sentence being given against thyself. Does somebody speak evil of thee? Say thou \"Had he known all, he would not have spoken only thus much.\"-So you admire what has been said, and are delighted with it? Aye, but you must follow it. For when we tell you all[fn-6-P693_565000:23-nf] these maxims of the heathen moralists, it is not because Scripture does not contain hundreds of such sayings, but because these are of more force to put you to the blush. As in fact Scripture itself is wont to use this appeal to our sense of shame; for, instance, when it says, \"Do ye even as the heathen.\" (Jer. xxxv. 3.) And the prophet Jeremiah brought forward into public view the children of Rechab, how they would not consent to violate the command of their father.-Miriam and her company spake evil of Moses, and he immediately begged them off from their punishment; nay, would not so much as let it be known that his cause was avenged. (Num. ch. xii.) But not so we: on the contrary, this is what we most desire; to have all men know that they have not passed unpunished. How long shall we breathe of the earth?-One party cannot make a fight. Pluck the madmen from both sides, you will exasperate them the more: but pluck from right or from left, and you have quenched the passion. The striker, if he has to do with one who will not put up with blows, is the more set on: but if with one who yields, he is the sooner unnerved, and his blow is spent upon himself. For no practised pugilist so unnerves the strength of his antagonist, as does a man who being injuriously treated makes no return. For the other only goes off ashamed, and condemned, first by his own conscience, and secondly by all the lookers on. And there is a proverb too, which says, that \"to honor another, is to honor one's self\": therefore also to abuse another is to abuse one's self. None, I repeat, will be able to harm us, unless we harm ourselves; nor will any make me poor, unless I make myself such. For come, let us look at it in this way. Suppose that I have a beggarly soul, and let all lavish all their substance upon me, what of that? So long as the soul is not changed, it is all in vain. Suppose I have a noble soul, and let all men take from me my substance: what of that? So long as you do not make the soul beggarly, no harm is done. Suppose my life be impure, and let all men say just the contrary of me: what of that? For though they say it, yet they do not judge thus of me in their heart. Again, suppose my life be pure, and let all say of me just the reverse: and what of that? For in their own conscience they will condemn themselves: since they are not persuaded of what they say. Just as we ought not to admit the praise, so neither the criminations. And why say I these things? None will ever be able to plot against us, nor lay us under any evil charge, if we choose (that they shall not). For how now, I ask you? Let him drag me into a court of justice, let him lay vexatious informations, let him, if you will, have the very soul out of me: and what of that? for a little while, undeservedly to suffer these things, what does it signify? \"Well,[fn-6-P694_568111:24-nf] but this,\" say you, \"is of itself an evil.\" Well, but of itself this is a good, to suffer undeservedly. What? would you have the suffering to be deserved? Let me mention again a piece of philosophy, from one of the sages. A certain person, says the story, had been put to death.

Nor has this blessing been eliminated out of our excellent nature by a fault which puts us under condemnation. Owing, indeed, to God's justice, who punishes, this fatal flaw has so far prevailed, that men are born with the fault of original sin; but yet its influence has not extended so far as to stop the birth of men. Just so does it happen in persons of adult age: whatever sins they commit, do not eliminate his manhood from man; nay, God's work continues still good, however evil be the deeds of the impious. For although \"man being placed in honour abideth not; and being without understanding, is compared with the beasts, and is like them,\"[fn-37-P3763_1434996:111-nf] yet the resemblance is not so absolute that he becomes a beast. There is a comparison, no doubt, between the two; but it is not by reason of nature, but through vice-not vice in the beast, but in nature. For so excellent is a man in comparison with a beast, that man's vice is beast's nature; still man's nature is never on this account changed into beast's nature. God, therefore, condemns man because of the fault wherewithal his nature is disgraced, and not because of his nature, which is not destroyed in consequence of its fault. Heaven forbid that we should think beasts are obnoxious to the sentence of condemnation! It is only proper that they should be free from our misery, inasmuch as they cannot partake of our blessedness. What, then, is there surprising or unjust in man's being subjected to an impure spirit-not on account of nature, but on account of that impurity of his which he has contracted in the stain of his birth, and which proceeds, not from the divine work, but from the will of man;-since also the impure spirit itself is a good thing considered as spirit, but evil in that it is impure? For the one is of God, and is His work, while the other emanates from man's own will. The stronger nature, therefore, that is, the angelic one, keeps the lower, or human, nature in subjection, by reason of the association of vice with the latter. Accordingly the Mediator, who was stronger than the angels, became weak for man's sake.[fn-37-P3764_1436469:112-nf] So that the pride of the Destroyer is destroyed by the humility of the Redeemer; and he who makes his boast over the sons of men of his angelic strength, is vanquished by the Son of God in the human weakness which He assumed.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"164","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"In his prayer, with a song, to whom but the Lord Christ does he say, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy hearing, and was afraid: O Lord, I have considered Thy works, and was greatly afraid?\"[fn-34-P3443_1866826:40-nf] What is this but the inexpressible admiration of the foreknown, new, and sudden salvation of men? \"In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be recognized.\" What is this but either between the two testaments, or between the two thieves, or between Moses and Elias talking with Him on the mount? \"While the years draw nigh, Thou wilt be recognized; at the coming of the time Thou wilt be shown,\" does not even need exposition. \"While my soul shall be troubled at Him, in wrath Thou wilt be mindful of mercy.\" What is this but that He puts Himself for the Jews, of whose nation He was, who were troubled with great anger and crucified Christ, when He, mindful of mercy, said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do?[fn-34-P3444_1867580:41-nf] \"God shall come from Teman, and the Holy One from the shady and close mountain.\"[fn-34-P3445_1867683:42-nf] What is said here, \"He shall come from Teman,\" some interpret \"from the south,\" or \"from the southwest,\" by which is signified the noonday, that is, the fervor of charity and the splendor of truth. \"The shady and close mountain\" might be understood in many ways, yet I prefer to take it as meaning the depth of the divine Scriptures, in which Christ is prophesied: for in the Scriptures there are many things shady and close which exercise the mind of the reader; and Christ comes thence when he who has understanding finds Him there. \"His power covereth up the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise.\" What is this but what is also said in the psalm, \"Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory above all the earth?\"[fn-34-P3446_1868439:43-nf] \"His splendor shall be as the light.\" What is it but that the fame of Him shall illuminate believers? \"Horns are in His hands.\" What is this but the trophy of the cross? \"And He hath placed the firm charity of His strength\"[fn-34-P3447_1868685:44-nf] needs no exposition. \"Before His face shall go the word, and it shall go forth into the field after His feet.\" What is this but that He should both be announced before His coming hither and after His return hence? \"He stood, and the earth was moved.\" What is this but that \"He stood\" for succor, \"and the earth was moved\" to believe? \"He regarded, and the nations melted;\" that is, He had compassion, and made the people penitent. \"The mountains are broken with violence;\" that is, through the power of those who work miracles the pride of the haughty is broken \"The everlasting hills flowed down;\" that is, they are humbled in time that they may be lifted up for eternity. \"I saw His goings [made] eternal for his labors;\" that is, I beheld His labor of love not left without the reward of eternity. \"The tents of Ethiopia shall be greatly afraid, and the tents of the land of Midian\" that is, even those nations which are not under the Roman authority, being suddenly terrified by the news of Thy wonderful works, shall become a Christian people. \"Wert Thou angry at the rivers, O Lord? or was Thy fury against the rivers? or was Thy rage against the sea?

Now the phantasy is the vision, which it did not hold or conceal, but poured forth in confession. \"The sun was raised up, and the moon stood still in her course;\" that is, Christ ascended into heaven, and the Church was established under her King. \"Thy darts shall go in the light;\" that is, Thy words shall not be sent in secret, but openly. For He had said to His own disciples, \"What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in the light.\"[fn-34-P3451_1871650:48-nf] \"By threatening thou shall diminish the earth;\" that is, by that threatening Thou shall humble men. \"And in fury Thou shall cast down the nations;\" for in punishing those who exalt themselves Thou dashest them one against another. \"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, that Thou mightest save Thy Christ; Thou hast sent death on the heads of the wicked.\" None of these words require exposition. \"Thou hast lifted up the bonds, even to the neck.\" This may be understood even of the good bonds of wisdom, that the feet may be put into its fetters, and the neck into its collar. \"Thou hast struck off in amazement of mind the bonds\" must be understood for, He lifts up the good and strikes off the bad, about. which it is said to Him, \"Thou hast broken asunder my bonds,\"[fn-34-P3452_1872452:49-nf] and that \"in amazement of mind,\" that is, wonderfully. \"The heads of the mighty shall be moved in it;\" to wit, in that wonder. \"They shall open their teeth like a poor man eating secretly.\" For some of the mighty among the Jews shall come to the Lord, admiring His works and words, and shall greedily eat the bread of His doctrine in secret for fear of the Jews, just as the Gospel has shown they did. \"And Thou hast sent into the sea Thy horses, troubling many waters,\" which are nothing else than many people; for unless all were troubled, some would not be converted with fear, others pursued with fury. \"I gave heed, and my belly trembled at the voice of the prayer of my lips; and trembling entered into my bones, and my habit of body was troubled under me.\" He gave heed to those things which he said, and was himself terrified at his own prayer, which he had poured forth prophetically, and in which he discerned things to come. For when many people are troubled, he saw the threatening tribulation of the Church, and at once acknowledged himself a member of it, and said, \"I shall rest in the day of tribulation,\" as being one of those Who are rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.[fn-34-P3453_1873667:50-nf] \"That I may ascend,\" he says, \"among the people of my pilgrimage,\" departing quite from the wicked people of his carnal kinship, who are not pilgrims in this earth, and do not seek the country above.[fn-34-P3454_1873886:51-nf] \"Although the fig-tree,\" he says, \"shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall lie, and the fields shall yield no meat; the sheep shall be cut off from the meat, and there shall be no oxen in the stalls.\" He sees that nation which was to slay Christ about to lose the abundance of spiritual supplies, which, in prophetic fashion, he has set forth by the figure of earthly plenty. And because that nation was to suffer such wrath of God, because, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, it wished to establish its own,[fn-34-P3455_1874471:52-nf] he immediately says, \"Yet will I rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in God my salvation. The Lord God is my strength, and He will set my feet in completion; He will place me above the heights, that I may conquer in His song,\" to wit, in that song of which something similar is said in the psalm, \"He set my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings, and put in my mouth a new song, a hymn to our God.\"[fn-34-P3456_1874885:53-nf] He therefore conquers in the song of the Lord, who takes pleasure in His praise, not in his own; that \"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-34-P3457_1875053:54-nf] But some copies have, \"I will joy in God my Jesus,\" which seems to me better than the version of those who, wishing to put it in Latin, have not set down that very name which for us it is dearer and sweeter to name.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"5.

For some provided abundant future nourishment for their lamps which were fed with oil, but others were careless, thinking only of the present. And, therefore, they are divided into two equal numbers of five, inasmuch as the one class preserved the five senses, which most people consider the gates of wisdom, pure and undefiled by sins; but the others, on the contrary, corrupted them by multitudes of sins, defiling themselves with evil. For having restrained them, and kept them free from righteousness, they bore a more abundant crop of transgressions, in consequence of which it came to pass that they were forbidden, and shut out from the divine courts. For whether, on the one hand, we do right, or, on the other, do wrong through these senses, our habits of good and evil are confirmed. And as Thallousa said that there is a chastity of the eyes, and of the ears, and of the tongue, and so on of the other senses; so here she who keeps inviolate the faith of the five pathways of virtue-sight, taste, smell, touch, and hearing-is called by the name of the five virgins, because she has kept the five forms of the sense pure to Christ, as a lamp, causing the light of holiness to shine forth clearly from each of them. For the flesh is truly, as it were, our five-lighted lamp, which the soul will bear like a torch, when it stands before Christ the Bridegroom, on the day of the resurrection, showing her faith springing out clear and bright through all the senses, as He Himself taught, saying,[fn-51-P5190_1566057:7-nf] \"I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled? \"meaning by the earth our bodies, in which He wished the swift-moving and fiery operation of His doctrine to be kindled.

All things are advancing towards an end, but that end is a condition of rest in the perfection, which is the goal of their advance, and not their abolition. Further, all things exist for the sake of the end, but the end itself is not the means to anything beyond: it is an ultimate, all-embracing whole, which rests in itself. And because it is self-contained, and works for no other time or object than itself, the goal is always that to which our hopes are directed. Therefore the Lord exhorts us to wait with patient and reverent faith until the end comes: Blessed is He that endureth to the end[fn-22-P2234_1429478:45-nf] . It is not a blessed dissolution, which awaits us, nor is non-existence the fruit, and annihilation the appointed reward of faith: but the end is the final attainment of the promised blessedness, and they are blessed who endure until the goal of perfect happiness is reached, when the expectation of faithful hope has no object beyond.

Suppose then we interpret the end as a dissolution, we are forced to acknowledge that, since there is an end for the blessed and for the wicked, the issue levels the godly with the ungodly, for the appointed end of both is a common annihilation. What of our expectation in heaven, if for us as well as for the wicked the end is a cessation of being? But even if there remains for the saints an expectation. whereas for the wicked there waits the end they have deserved, we cannot conceive that end as a final dissolution. What punishment would it be for the wicked to be beyond the feeling of avenging torments, because the capability of suffering has been removed by dissolution?

The same conclusion, however, shall now be made clear[fn-41-P4180_1362357:301-nf] by another method; it is not simply[fn-41-P4181_1362412:302-nf] imperfect, but actually[fn-41-P4182_1362452:303-nf] feeble, weak, and exhausted, failing to embrace the full number[fn-41-P4183_1362529:304-nf] of its material objects, and not manifesting itself in them all. For all are not put into a state of salvation[fn-41-P4184_1362661:305-nf] by it; but the Creator's subjects, both Jew and Christian, are all excepted.[fn-41-P4185_1362778:306-nf] Now, when the greater part thus perish, how can that goodness be defended as a perfect one which is inoperative in most cases, is somewhat only in few, naught in many, succumbs to perdition, and is a partner with destruction?[fn-41-P4186_1363022:307-nf] And if so many shall miss salvation, it will not be with goodness, but with malignity, that the greater perfection will lie. For as it is the operation of goodness which brings salvation, so is it malevolence which thwarts it.[fn-41-P4187_1363274:308-nf] Since, however, this goodness) saves but few, and so rather leans to the alternative of not saving, it will show itself to greater perfection by not interposing help than by helping. Now, you will not be able to attribute goodness (to your god) in reference to the Creator, (if accompanied with) failure towards all. For whomsoever you call in to judge the question, it is as a dispenser of goodness, if so be such a title can be made out,[fn-41-P4188_1363739:309-nf] and not as a squanderer thereof, as you claim your god to be, that you must submit the divine character for determination. So long, then, as you prefer your god to the Creator on the simple ground of his goodness, and since he professes to have this attribute as solely and wholly his own, he ought not to have been wanting in it to any one. However, I do not now wish to prove that Marcion's god is imperfect in goodness because of the perdition of the greater number. I am content to illustrate this imperfection by the fact that even those whom he saves are found to possess but an imperfect salvation-that is, they are saved only so far as the soul is concerned,[fn-41-P4189_1364511:310-nf] but lost in their body, which, according to him, does not rise again. Now, whence comes this halving of salvation, if not from a failure of goodness? What could have been a better proof of a perfect goodness, than the recovery of the whole man to salvation? Totally damned by the Creator, he should have been totally restored by the most merciful god. I rather think that by Marcion's rule the body is baptized, is deprived of marriage,[fn-41-P4190_1365172:311-nf] is cruelly tortured in confession. But although sins are attributed to the body, yet they are preceded by the guilty concupiscence of the soul; nay, the first motion of sin must be ascribed to the soul, to which the flesh acts in the capacity of a servant. By and by, when freed from the soul, the flesh sins no more.[fn-41-P4191_1365607:312-nf] So that in this matter goodness is unjust, and likewise imperfect, in that it leaves to destruction the more harmless substance, which sins rather by compliance than in will. Now, although Christ put not on the verity of the flesh, as your heresy is pleased to assume, He still vouchsafed to take upon Him the semblance thereof. Surely, therefore, some regard was due to it from Him, because of this His reigned assumption of it. Besides, what else is man than flesh, since no doubt it was the corporeal rather than the spiritual[fn-41-P4192_1366170:313-nf] element from which the Author of man's nature gave him his designation?[fn-41-P4193_1366344:314-nf] \"And the Lord God made man of the dust of the ground,\" not of spiritual essence; this afterwards came from the divine afflatus: \"and man became a living soul.\" What, then, is man? Made, no doubt of it, of the dust; and God placed him in paradise, because He moulded him, not breathed him, into being-a fabric of flesh, not of spirit. Now, this being the case, with what face will you contend for the perfect character of that goodness which did not fail in some one particular only of man's deliverance, but in its general capacity? If that is a plenary grace and a substantial mercy which brings salvation to the soul alone, this were the better life which we now enjoy whole and entire; whereas to rise again but in part will be a chastisement, not a liberation. The proof of the perfect goodness is, that man, after his rescue, should be delivered from the domicile and power of the malignant deity unto the protection of the most good and merciful God. Poor dupe of Marcion, fever[fn-41-P4194_1367416:315-nf] is hard upon you; and your painful flesh produces a crop of all sorts of briers and thorns. Nor is it only to the Creator's thunderbolts that you lie exposed, or to wars, and pestilences, and His other heavier strokes, but even to His creeping insects. In what respect do you suppose yourself liberated from His kingdom when His flies are still creeping upon your face? If your deliverance lies in the future, why not also in the present, that it may be perfectly wrought? Far different is our condition in the sight of Him who is the Author, the Judge, the injured[fn-41-P4195_1368001:316-nf] Head of our race!

And if we would more exactly and carefully scrutinize the words which refer to the resurrection of the good, we may refer to the first resurrection the words, \"the dead shall rise again,\" and to the second the following words, \"and all who were in the graves shall rise again.\" And if we ask what relates to those saints whom the Lord at His coming shall find alive upon earth, the following clause may suitably be referred to them; \"All who are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is their health.\" By \"health\" in this place it is best to understand immortality. For that is the most perfect health which is not repaired by nourishment as by a daily remedy. In like manner the same prophet, affording hope to the good and terrifying the wicked regarding the day of judgment, says, \"Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will flow down upon them as a river of peace, and upon the glory of the Gentiles as a rushing torrent; their sons shall be carried on the shoulders, and shall be comforted on the knees. As one whom his mother comforteth, so shall I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall rise up like a herb; and the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers, and He shall threaten the contumacious. For, behold, the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\"[fn-39-P3953_2174216:102-nf] In His promise to the good he says that He will flow down as a river of peace, that is to say, in the greatest possible abundance of peace. With this peace we shall in the end be refreshed; but of this we have spoken abundantly in the preceding book. It is this river in which he says He shall flow down upon those to whom He promises so great happiness, that we may understand that in the region of that felicity, which is in heaven, all things are satisfied from this river. But because there shall thence flow, even upon earthly bodies, the peace of incorruption and immortality, therefore he says that He shall flow down as this river, that He may as it were pour Himself from things above to things beneath, and make men the equals of the angels. By \"Jerusalem,\" too, we should understand not that which serves with her children, but that which, according to the apostle, is our free mother, eternal in the heavens.[fn-39-P3954_2175163:103-nf] In her we shall be comforted as we pass toilworn from earth's cards and calamities, and be taken up as her children on her knees and shoulders. Inexperienced and new to such blandishments, we shall be received into unwonted bliss. There we shall see, and our heart shall rejoice. He does not say what we shall see; but what but God, that the promise in the Gospel may be fulfilled in us, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God?\"[fn-39-P3955_2175628:104-nf] What shall we see but all those things which now we see not, but believe in, and of which the idea we form, according to our feeble capacity, is incomparably less than the reality? \"And ye shall see,\" he says, \"and your heart shall rejoice.\" Here ye believe, there ye shall see.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"25.

For the Psalmist's words refer to the vessels of mercy and the children of the promise, of whom the prophet himself was one; for when he had said, \"Shall God forget to be gracious? shall He shut up in His anger His tender mercies?\" and then immediately subjoins, \"And I said, Now I begin: this is the change wrought by the right hand of the Most High,\"[fn-42-P4249_2323276:59-nf] he manifestly explained what he meant by the words, \"Shall he shut up in His anger His tender mercies?\" For God's anger is this mortal life, in which man is made like to vanity, and his days pass as a shadow.[fn-42-P4250_2323506:60-nf] Yet in this anger God does not forget to be gracious, causing His sun to shine and His. rain to descend on the just and the unjust;[fn-42-P4251_2323657:61-nf] and thus He does not in His anger cut short His tender mercies, and especially in what the Psalmist speaks of in the words, \"Now I begin: this change is from the right hand of the Most High;\" for He changes for the better the vessels of mercy, even while they are still in this most wretched life, which is God's anger, and even while His anger is manifesting itself in this miserable corruption; for \"in His anger He does not shut up His tender mercies.\" And since the truth of this divine canticle is quite satisfied by this application of it, there is no need to give it a reference to that place in which those who do not belong to the city of God are punished in eternal fire.

Those parties oppose this opinion who think that the said communion, which we call either Godhead, or Love, or Charity, is not a substance. Moreover, they require the Holy Spirit to be set forth to them according to substance; neither do they take it to have been otherwise impossible for the expression God is Love\" to have been used, unless love were a substance. In this, indeed, they are influenced by the wont of things of a bodily nature. For if two bodies are connected with each other in such wise as to be placed in juxtaposition one with the other, the connection itself is not a body: inasmuch as when these bodies which had been connected are separated, no such connection certainly is found [any more]; while, at the same time, it is not understood to have departed, as it were, and migrated, as is the case with those bodies themselves. But men like these should make their heart pure, so far as they can, in order that they may have power to see that in the substance of God there is not anything of such a nature as would imply that therein substance is one thing, and that which is accident to substance (aliud quod accidat subsantioe) another thing, and not substance; whereas whatsoever can be taken to be therein is substance. These things, however, can easily be spoken and believed; but seen, so as to reveal how they are in themselves, they absolutely cannot be, except by the pure heart. For which reason, whether the opinion in question be true, or something else be the case, the faith ought to be maintained unshaken, so that we should call the Father God, the Son God, the Holy Spirit God, and yet not affirm three Gods, but hold the said Trinity to be one God; and again, not affirm these [Persons] to be different in nature, but hold them to be of the same substance; and further uphold it, not as if the Father were sometime the Son, and sometime the Holy Spirit, but in such wise that the Father is always the Father, and the Son always the Son, and the Holy Spirit always the Holy Spirit. Neither should we make any affirmation on the subject of things unseen rashly, as if we had knowledge, but [only modestly] as believing. For these things cannot be seen except by the heart made pure; and [even] he who in this life sees them \"in part,\" as it has been said, and \"in an enigma,\"[fn-32-P3296_1514137:112-nf] cannot secure it that the person to whom he speaks shall also see them, if he is hampered by impurities of heart. \"Blessed,\" however, \"are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-32-P3297_1514347:113-nf] This is the faith on the subject of God our Maker and Renewer.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_25_homily_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Forasmuch then as He had made much discourse about almsgiving, and brought forward God, \"Who maketh His sun to rise on the evil and the good,\"[fn-19-P1957_652260:7-nf] and by motives from all quarters had urged them on to this, and had persuaded them to exult in the abundance of their giving; He finishes by taking away also all things that encumber this fair olive tree.

Accordingly it is en-joined by the apostle: \"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church.\"[fn-38-P3888_1474236:32-nf] Of this bond the substance[fn-38-P3889_1474280:33-nf] undoubtedly is this, that the man and the woman who are joined together in matrimony should remain inseparable as long as they live; and that it should be unlawful for one consort to be parted from the other, except for the cause of fornication.[fn-38-P3890_1474547:34-nf] For this is preserved in the case of Christ and the Church; so that, as a living one with a living one, there is no divorce, no separation for ever. And so complete is the observance of this bond in the city of our God, in His holy mountain[fn-38-P3891_1474806:35-nf] -that is to say, in the Church of Christ-by all married believers, who are undoubtedly members of Christ, that, although women marry, and men take wives, for the purpose of procreating children, it is never permitted one to put away even an unfruitful wife for the sake of having another to bear children. And whosoever does this is held to be guilty of adultery by the law of the gospel; though not by this world's rule, which allows a divorce between the parties, without even the allegation of guilt, and the contraction of other nuptial engagements,-a concession which, the Lord tells us, even the holy Moses extended to the people of Israel, because of the hardness of their hearts.[fn-38-P3892_1475514:36-nf] The same condemnation applies to the woman, if she is married to another man. So enduring, indeed, are the rights of marriage between those who have contracted them, as long as they both live, that even they are looked on as man and wife still, who have separated from one another, rather than they between whom a new connection has been formed. For by this new connection they would not be guilty of adultery, if the previous matrimonial relation did not still continue. If the husband die, with whom a true marriage was made, a true marriage is now possible by a connection which would before have been adultery. Thus between the conjugal pair, as long as they live, the nuptial bond has a permanent obligation, and can be cancelled neither by separation nor by union with another. But this permanence avails, in such cases, only for injury from the sin, not for a bond of the covenant. In like manner the soul of an apostate, which renounces as it were its marriage union with Christ, does not, even though it has cast its faith away, lose the sacrament of its faith, which it received in the laver of regeneration.

If the eyes of the spiritual body have no more power than the eyes which we now possess, manifestly God cannot be seen with them. They must be of a very different power if they can look upon that incorporeal nature which is not contained in any place, but is all in every place. For though we say that God is in heaven and on earth, as He, Himself says by the prophet, \"I fill heaven and earth,\"[fn-45-P4537_2513709:75-nf] we do not mean that there is one part of God in heaven and another part on earth; but He is all in heaven and all on earth, not at alternate intervals of time, but both at once, as no bodily nature can be. The eye, then, shall have a vastly superior power,-the power not of keen sight, such as is ascribed to serpents or eagles, for however keenly these animals see, they can discern nothing but bodily substances,-but the power of seeing things incorporeal. Possibly it was this great power of vision which was temporarily communicated to the eyes of the holy Job while yet in this mortal body, when he says to God, \"I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth Thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and melt away, and count myself dust and ashes;\"[fn-45-P4538_2514500:76-nf] although there is no reason why we should not understand this of the eve of the heart, of which the apostle says, \"Having the eyes of your heart illuminated.\"[fn-45-P4539_2514680:77-nf] But that God shall be seen with these eyes no Christian doubts who believingly accepts what our God and Master says, \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\"[fn-45-P4540_2514871:78-nf] But whether in the future life God shall also be seen with the bodily eye, this is now our question.","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_118_treatise_viii_on_works_and_alms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"ANF-05","text":"11.

It has been ordained, indeed, in the ancient statutes, that bishops who have been ejected and spoiled of their property should recover their churches, and, in the first place, have all their property restored to them; and then, in the second place, that if any one may desire to accuse them justly, he should do so at the like risk; that the judges should be discreet, the bishops right-minded and harmonious in the Church, where they should be witnesses for ever one who seemed to be oppressed; and that they should not answer till all that belonged to them was restored to them, and to their churches by law without detriment. Nor is it strange, brethren, if they persecute you, when they persecuted even to death your Head, Christ our Lord. Yet even persecutions are to be endured patiently, that ye may be known to be His disciples, for whom also ye suffer. Whence, too, he says Himself, \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake.\"[fn-89-P8912_2899720:4-nf] Sustained by these testimonies, we ought not greatly to fear the reproach of men, nor be overcome by their up-braidings, since the Lord gives us this command by Isaiah the prophet, saying, \"Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, my people, in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; \"[fn-89-P8913_2900084:5-nf] considering what is written in the Psalm, \"Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the heart,[fn-89-P8914_2900214:6-nf] and the thoughts of such men, that they are vanity,\"[fn-89-P8915_2900284:7-nf] \"They spoke vanity every one with his neighbour: with deceitful lips in their heart, and with an evil heart they spoke. But the Lord shall cut off all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things; who have said, Our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? \"[fn-89-P8916_2900571:8-nf] For if they kept these things in memory, they would by no means break forth into so great wickedness. For they do not this by laudable and paternal instruction (probabili et paterna doctrina), but that they may wreak their vengeful feeling against the servants of God. For it is written, \"The way of a fool is right in his eyes; \"[fn-89-P8917_2900919:9-nf] and, \"There are ways which seem right unto a man, but the end thereof leads to death.\"[fn-89-P8918_2901025:10-nf] Now we who suffer these things ought to leave them to the judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his works;[fn-89-P8919_2901173:11-nf] who also has thundered through His servants, saying, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay.\"[fn-89-P8920_2901281:12-nf] Assist ye, therefore, one another in good faith, and by deed and with a hearty will; nor let any one remove his hand from the help of a brother, since \"by this,\" saith the Lord, \"shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\"[fn-89-P8921_2901557:13-nf] Whence, too, He speaks by the prophet, saying, \"Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!\"[fn-89-P8922_2901706:14-nf] In a spiritual dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord which is in God, and in the unity of the faith which distinguishes this pleasant dwelling according to truth, which indeed was more beauteously illustrated in Aaron and the priests[fn-89-P8923_2901966:15-nf] clothed with honour, as ointment upon the head, nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to the end of wisdom. For in this dwelling the Lord has promised blessing and eternal life. Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word for love's sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own things. For it is not good to repay detraction with detraction, or according to the common proverb to cast out a beam with a beam (excutere palum palo). Be it far from us. Such manners are not ours. May the Godhead indeed forbid it. By the just judgment of God, power is given sometimes to sinners to persecute His saints, in order that they who are aided and borne on by the Spirit of God may become more glorious through the discipline of sufferings. But to those very persons who persecute, and reproach, and injure them, there will doubtless be woe. Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of God; for injury done to them concerns Him whose service they discharge, and whose function they execute. But we pray that a door of enclosure be placed upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be defiled by their lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth no hurtful word. Whence also the Lord speaks by the prophet, \"I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue.\"[fn-89-P8924_2903416:16-nf] May the Lord Almighty, and His only-begotten Son and our Saviour Jesus Christ, give you this incitement, that with all means in your power you aid all the brethren under whatsoever tribulations they labour, and esteem, as is meet, their sufferings your own.

What then had been his Course,[fn-54-P5408_1670853:156-nf] for him to be described as first descending from his own heaven to the Creator's? For why should I abstain from censuring those parts of the statement which do not satisfy the requirement of an ordinary narrative, but always end in a falsehood? To be sure, our censure has been once for all expressed in the question, which we have already[fn-54-P5409_1671208:157-nf] suggested: Whether, when descending through the Creator's domain, and indeed in hostility to him, he could possibly have been admitted by him, and by him been transmitted to the earth, which was equally his territory? Now, however, I want also to know the remainder of his course down, assuming that he came down. For we must not be too nice in inquiring[fn-54-P5410_1671639:158-nf] whether it is supposed that he was seen in any place. To come into view[fn-54-P5411_1671788:159-nf] indicates[fn-54-P5412_1671815:160-nf] a sudden unexpected glance, which for a moment fixed[fn-54-P5413_1671882:161-nf] the eye upon the object that passed before the view, without staying. But when it happens that a descent has been effected, it is apparent, and comes under the notice of the eyes.[fn-54-P5414_1672080:162-nf] Moreover, it takes account of fact, and thus obliges one to examine in what condition with what preparation,[fn-54-P5415_1672571:163-nf] with how much violence or moderation, and further, at what time of the day or night, the descent was made; who, again, saw the descent, who reported it, who seriously avouched the fact, which certainly was not easy to be believed, even after the asseveration. It is, in short, too bad[fn-54-P5416_1672873:164-nf] that Romulus should have had in Proculus an avoucher of his ascent to heaven, when the Christ of (this) god could not find any one to announce his descent from heaven; just as if the ascent of the one and the descent of the other were not effected on one and the same ladder of falsehood! Then, what had he to do with Galilee, if he did not belong to the Creator by whom[fn-54-P5417_1673261:165-nf] that region was destined (for His Christ) when about to enter on His ministry?[fn-54-P5418_1673352:166-nf] As Isaiah says: \"Drink in this first, and be prompt, O region of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, and ye others who (inhabit) the sea-coast, and that of Jordan, Galilee of the nations, ye people who sit in darkness, behold a great light; upon you, who inhabit (that) land, sitting in the shadow of death, the light hath arisen.\"[fn-54-P5419_1673715:167-nf] It is, however, well that Marcion's god does claim to be the enlightener of the nations, that so he might have the better reason for coming down from heaven; only, if it must needs be,[fn-54-P5420_1674551:168-nf] he should rather have made Pontus his place of descent than Galilee. But since both the place and the work of illumination according to the prophecy are compatible with Christ, we begin to discern[fn-54-P5421_1674766:169-nf] that He is the subject of the prophecy, which shows that at the very outset of His ministry, He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them;[fn-54-P5422_1674953:170-nf] for Marcion has erased the passage as an interpolation.[fn-54-P5423_1675029:171-nf] It will, however, be vain for him to deny that Christ uttered in word what He forthwith did partially indeed. For the prophecy about place He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the synagogue. As the adage runs: \"The business on which we are come, do at once.\" Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; \"[fn-54-P5424_1675421:172-nf] and, \"It is not meet to take the children'sbread, and to cast it to dogs,\"[fn-54-P5425_1675517:173-nf] -in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely (this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to Israelites first that He offers the \"bread\" of His doctrine; surely it is because they are \"children\" that He shows them this priority.[fn-54-P5426_1675958:174-nf] Observe, He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as \"dogs.\" For to whom else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the synagogue-one so abruptly appearing,[fn-54-P5427_1676287:175-nf] so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus-that most faithful witness of the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that He must not be admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right of entering[fn-54-P5428_1676727:176-nf] the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But \"they were all astonished at His doctrine.\" Of course they were; \"for, says (St. Luke), \"His word was with power[fn-54-P5429_1677113:177-nf] -not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets. No doubt, His divine discourse[fn-54-P5430_1677231:178-nf] gave forth both power and grace, building up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. Otherwise, instead of \"astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also, without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity, Inasmuch, then, as the Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally[fn-54-P5431_1677982:179-nf] shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged as belonging to Him,[fn-54-P5432_1678239:180-nf] in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged a deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In the same passage, \"the spirit of an unclean devil\" exclaims: \"What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God.\"[fn-54-P5433_1678598:181-nf] I do not here raise the question whether this appellation was suitable to one who ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by the Creator.[fn-54-P5434_1678771:182-nf] Elsewhere[fn-54-P5435_1678806:183-nf] there has been already given a full consideration of His titles.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Out of so many kinds of occupations, why indeed had He such respect for that of fishermen, as to select from it for apostles Simon and the sons of Zebedee (for it cannot seem to be the mere fact itself for which the narrative was meant to be drawn out[fn-54-P5492_1690334:231-nf] ), saying to Peter, when he trembled at the very large draught of the fishes, \"Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men? \"[fn-54-P5493_1690499:232-nf] By saying this, He suggested to them the meaning of the fulfilled prophecy, that it was even He who by Jeremiah had foretold, \"Behold, I will send many fishers; and they shall fish them,\"[fn-54-P5494_1690712:233-nf] that is, men. Then at last they left their boats, and followed Him, understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had declared. It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his Antitheses, that the position of Marcion derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial care,[fn-54-P5495_1691419:234-nf] as a proof in his domain,[fn-54-P5496_1691476:235-nf] a certain companion in misery (suntalai/pwron), and associate in hatred (summisou/menon), with himself, for the cure of leprosy,[fn-54-P5497_1691643:236-nf] I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a leper (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food,[fn-54-P5498_1692043:237-nf] forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious: wherever a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the law should be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by carnal facts[fn-54-P5499_1692312:238-nf] -and thus[fn-55-P5500_1692363:239-nf] not destroying, but rather building up, that law which He wanted to have more earnestly acknowledged-touched the leper, by whom (even although as man He might have been defiled) He could not be defiled as God, being of course incorruptible. The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not cause defilement to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy[fn-55-P5501_1692972:240-nf] of the law that He touched the leper-disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement-how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body[fn-55-P5502_1693147:241-nf] which could be defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity[fn-55-P5503_1693527:242-nf] for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue. If, however, the Creator's prophet Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone,[fn-55-P5504_1693778:243-nf] to the exclusion of[fn-55-P5505_1693813:244-nf] so many lepers in Israel,[fn-55-P5506_1693890:245-nf] this fact contributes nothing to the distinction of Christ, as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing this Israelite leper, although a stranger to him, whom his own Lord had been unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather[fn-55-P5507_1694185:246-nf] was significant throughout the nations of the world[fn-55-P5508_1694280:247-nf] of their own cleansing in Christ their light,[fn-55-P5509_1694611:248-nf] steeped as they were in the stains of the seven deadly sins:[fn-55-P5510_1694770:249-nf] idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery, fornication, false-witness, and fraud.[fn-55-P5511_1694876:250-nf] Seven times, therefore, as if once for each,[fn-55-P5512_1696020:251-nf] did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might celebrate the expiation of a perfect hebdomad;[fn-55-P5513_1696153:252-nf] and because the virtue and fulness of the one baptism was thus solemnly imputed[fn-55-P5514_1696293:253-nf] to Christ, alone, who was one day to establish on earth not only a revelation, but also a baptism, endued with compendious efficacy.[fn-55-P5515_1696444:254-nf] Even Marcion finds here an antithesis:[fn-55-P5516_1696636:255-nf] how that Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied water, and that seven times; whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that but once for all, instantly effected[fn-55-P5517_1696845:256-nf] the cure. And surely I might venture[fn-55-P5518_1696905:257-nf] to claim[fn-55-P5519_1696939:258-nf] the Very Word also as of the Creator's substance. There is nothing of which He who was the primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth,[fn-55-P5520_1697113:259-nf] it is incredible that that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a single malady, which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the world! From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha-because, in fact, the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground that He was once more powerful than a servant of the Creator-since, in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater![fn-55-P5521_1697999:260-nf] For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has simply done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man to publish abroad the cure; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested that the usual course should be followed: \"Go, show thyself to the priest, and present the offering which Moses commanded.\"[fn-55-P5522_1698604:261-nf] For the figurative signs of the law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.[fn-55-P5523_1698737:262-nf] These types signified that a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified[fn-55-P5524_1698836:263-nf] from the stains thereof by the word of God, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, who is the Catholic Priest of the Father.[fn-55-P5525_1699056:264-nf] Accordingly He added: \"that it may be for a testimony unto you\"-one, no doubt, whereby He would testify that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake[fn-55-P5526_1699421:265-nf] their sicknesses and infirmities. This very consistent and becoming explanation of \"the testimony,\" that adulator of his own Christ, Marcion seeks to exclude under the cover of mercy and gentleness. For, being both good (such are his words), and knowing, besides, that every man who had been freed from leprosy would be sure to perform the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept. Well, what then? Has He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the law) or not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer of the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because there would not exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his claim to belong to the other god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a subsequent destruction of the law, it is a false testimony which he has since imposed upon them in his cure of the leper; because he has forsaken his goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was good whilst upholding the law,[fn-55-P5527_1700511:266-nf] he has now become evil as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was good. For no one permits himself in the support of an evil thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted obedience to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared[fn-55-P5528_1700843:267-nf] as the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift because he knew that every cured leper would be sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously done. In vain, therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying the law, when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet,[fn-55-P5529_1701238:268-nf] because he knew their disposition,[fn-55-P5530_1701288:269-nf] he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect of the law,[fn-55-P5531_1701375:270-nf] since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, that man might of his own simple will obey the law? For then might he have seemed to some extent[fn-55-P5532_1701566:271-nf] to have persisted in his patience. But he adds also his own authority increased by the weight of this \"testimony.\" Of what testimony, I ask,[fn-55-P5533_1701727:272-nf] if not that of the assertion of the law? Surely it matters not in what way he asserted the law-whether as good, or as supererogatory,[fn-55-P5534_1701873:273-nf] or as patient, or as inconstant-provided, Marcion, I drive you from your position.[fn-55-P5535_1701976:274-nf] Observe,[fn-55-P5536_1701999:275-nf] he commanded that the law should be fulfilled. In whatever way he commanded it, in the same way might he also have first uttered that sentiment:[fn-55-P5537_1702157:276-nf] \"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-55-P5538_1702227:277-nf] What business, therefore, had you to erase out of the Gospel that which was quite consistent in it?[fn-55-P5539_1702347:278-nf] For you have confessed that, in his goodness, he did in act what you deny that he did in word.[fn-55-P5540_1702466:279-nf] We have therefore good proof that He uttered the word, in the fact that He did the deed; and that you have rather expunged the Lord's word, than that our (evangelists)[fn-55-P5541_1702823:280-nf] have inserted it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Concerning the Sabbath also I have this to premise, that this question could not have arisen, if Christ did not publicly proclaim[fn-56-P5642_1725309:372-nf] the Lord of the Sabbath. Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling[fn-56-P5643_1725409:373-nf] the Sabbath, if He had a right[fn-56-P5644_1725463:374-nf] to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution[fn-56-P5645_1725967:375-nf] of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new[fn-56-P5646_1726602:376-nf] god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ interfered with[fn-56-P5647_1727023:377-nf] the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually[fn-56-P5648_1727271:378-nf] annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command-according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken[fn-56-P5649_1727575:379-nf] by Joshua,[fn-56-P5650_1727617:380-nf] so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn day, He was only professedly following[fn-56-P5651_1727841:381-nf] the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Your new moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth.\"[fn-56-P5652_1728031:382-nf] Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's purpose.[fn-56-P5653_1728805:383-nf] For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent[fn-56-P5654_1729263:384-nf] -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.[fn-56-P5655_1729417:385-nf] Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,[fn-56-P5656_1730104:386-nf] when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there[fn-56-P5657_1730226:387-nf] put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention[fn-56-P5658_1730389:388-nf] of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend[fn-56-P5659_1730487:389-nf] His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;[fn-56-P5660_1730723:390-nf] because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse[fn-56-P5661_1730908:391-nf] the Creator's indulgence:[fn-56-P5662_1731004:392-nf] because He is Himself good according to His example-is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,[fn-56-P5663_1731205:393-nf] that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ[fn-56-P5664_1731426:394-nf] is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, \"In it thou shalt not do any work of thine,\"[fn-56-P5665_1731774:395-nf] by the word thine[fn-56-P5666_1731811:396-nf] it restricts the prohibition to human work-which every one performs in his own employment or business-and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, \"Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,\"[fn-56-P5667_1732452:397-nf] except what is to be done for any soul,[fn-56-P5668_1732512:398-nf] that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;[fn-56-P5669_1732887:399-nf] because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.[fn-56-P5670_1733113:400-nf] Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? \"[fn-56-P5671_1733368:401-nf] In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,[fn-56-P5672_1733489:402-nf] remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,[fn-56-P5673_1733684:403-nf] He was called \"Lord of the Sabbath,\"[fn-56-P5674_1733755:404-nf] because He maintained[fn-56-P5675_1733796:405-nf] the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,[fn-56-P5676_1733929:406-nf] as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken[fn-56-P5677_1734134:407-nf] by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really[fn-56-P5678_1734330:408-nf] God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,[fn-56-P5679_1734589:409-nf] reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God \"with the lip, not the heart,\"[fn-56-P5680_1734790:410-nf] He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,[fn-56-P5681_1734978:411-nf] He declared them to be \"true, and delightful, and inviolable.\" Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, \"I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-56-P5682_1735446:412-nf] although Marcion has gagged[fn-56-P5683_1735494:413-nf] His mouth by this word.[fn-56-P5684_1735536:414-nf] For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath[fn-56-P5685_1735925:415-nf] and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,[fn-56-P5686_1736213:416-nf] -a course which[fn-56-P5687_1736247:417-nf] His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the prophet Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite woman,[fn-56-P5688_1736576:418-nf] you see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proper employment for the Creator's Sabbaths of old[fn-56-P5689_1736716:419-nf] to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,[fn-56-P5690_1736847:420-nf] the gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils[fn-56-P5691_1736964:421-nf] the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: \"The weak hands are strengthened,\" as were also \"the feeble knees\"[fn-56-P5692_1737102:422-nf] in the sick of the palsy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery.\"[fn-66-P6658_1950353:1320-nf] In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away. Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another. His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough.

This vainglorious observer of the commandments was therefore convicted[fn-67-P6795_1982104:1451-nf] of holding money in much higher estimation (than charity).

That Jesus was descended from that (alien) god (of Marcion), to subvert the Creator and overthrow the law and the prophets? That He was not the destined offshoot from the root of Jesse, and the fruit of David's loins, the restorer[fn-68-P6808_1986023:1464-nf] also of the blind? But I apprehend there were at that time no such stone-blind persons as Marcion, that an opinion like this could have constituted the faith of the blind man, and have induced him to confide in the mere name,[fn-68-P6809_1986271:1465-nf] of Jesus, the Son of David. He, who knew all this of Himself,[fn-68-P6810_1986444:1466-nf] and wished others to know it also, endowed the faith of this man-although it was already gifted with a better sight, and although it was in possession of the true light-with the external vision likewise, in order that we too might learn the rule of faith, and at the same time find its recompense.

For as we cannot say that generation is a modified ungeneracy, but the signification of the terms e/nnhsij and a0gennhsi/a are absolutely contradictory and mutually exclusive, so, if the same distinction is to be preserved between the Light of the Father and that conceived as existing in the Son, it will be logically concluded that the Son is not henceforth to be conceived as Light, as he is excluded alike from ungeneracy itself, and from the light which accompanies that condition,-and He Who is something different from light will evidently, by consequence, have affinity with its contrary,-since this absurdity, I say, results from his principles, Eunomius endeavours to explain it away by dialectic artifices, delivering himself as follows: \"For we know, we know the true Light, we know Him who created the light after the heavens and the earth, we have heard the Life and Truth Himself, even Christ, saying to His disciples, `Ye are the light of the world[fn-21-P2114_1277805:25-nf] ,' we have learned from the blessed Paul, when he gives the title of `Light unapproachable[fn-21-P2115_1277917:26-nf] ' to the God over all, and by the addition defines and teaches us the transcendent superiority of His Light; and now that we have learnt that there is so great a difference between the one Light and the other, we shall not patiently endure so much as the mere mention of the notion that the conception of light in either case is one and the same.\" Can he be serious when he advances such arguments in his attempts against the truth, or is he experimenting upon the dulness of those who follow his error to see whether they can detect so childish and transparent a fallacy, or have no sense to discern such a barefaced imposition? For I suppose that no one is so senseless as not to perceive the juggling with equivocal terms by which Eunomius deludes both himself and his admirers. The disciples, he says, were termed light, and that which was produced in the course of creation is also called light. But who does not know that in these only the name is common, and the thing meant in each case is quite different? For the light of the sun gives discernment to the sight, but the word of the disciples implants in men's souls the illumination of the truth. If, then, he is aware of this difference even in the case of that light, so that he thinks the light of the body is one thing, and the light of the soul another, we need no longer discuss the point with him, since his defence itself condemns him if we hold our peace. But if in that light he cannot discover such a difference as regards the mode of operation, (for it is not, he may say, the light of the eyes that illumines the flesh, and the spiritual light which illumines the soul, but the operation and the potency of the one light and of the other is the same, operating in the same sphere and on the same objects,) then how is it that from the difference between the light of the beams of the sun and that of the words of the Apostles, he infers a like difference between the Only-begotten Light and the Light of the Father? \"But the Son,\" he says, \"is called the `true' Light, the Father `Light unapproachable.'\" Well, these additional distinctions import a difference in degree only, and not in kind, between the light of the Son and the light of the Father. He thinks that the \"true\" is one thing, and the \"unapproachable\" another. I suppose there is no one so idiotic as not to see the real identity of meaning in the two terms. For the \"true\" and the \"unapproachable\" are each of them removed in an equally absolute degree from their contraries. For as the \"true\" does not admit any intermixture of the false, even so the \"unapproachable\" does not admit the access of its contrary. For the \"unapproachable\" is surely unapproachable by evil. But the light of the Son is not evil; for how can any one see in evil that which is true? Since, then, the truth is not evil, no one can say that the light which is in the Father is unapproachable by the truth. For if it were to reject the truth it would of course be associated with falsehood. For the nature of contradictories is such that the absence of the better involves the presence of its opposite. If, then, any one were to say that the Light of the Father was contemplated as remote from the presentation of its opposite, he would interpret the term \"unapproachable\" in a manner agreeable to the intention of the Apostle. But if he were to say that \"unapproachable\" signified alienation from good, he would suppose nothing else than that God was alien from, and at enmity with, Himself, being at the same time good and opposed to good. But this is impossible: for the good is akin to good. Accordingly the one Light is not divergent from the other. For the Son is the true Light, and the Father is Light unapproachable. In fact I would make bold to say that the man who should interchange the two attributes would not be wrong. For the true is unapproachable by the false, and on the other side, the unapproachable is found to be in unsullied truth. Accordingly the unapproachable is identical with the true, because that which is signified by each expression is equally inaccessible to evil. What is the difference then, that is imagined to exist in these by him who imposes on himself and his followers by the equivocal use of the term \"Light\"? But let us not pass over this point either without notice, that it is only after garbling the Apostle's words to suit his own fancy that he cites the phrase as if it came from him. For Paul says, \"dwelling in light unapproachable[fn-21-P2116_1282492:27-nf] .\" But there is a great difference between being oneself something and being in something. For he who said, \"dwelling in light unapproachable,\" did not, by the word \"dwelling,\" indicate God Himself, but that which surrounds Him, which in our view is equivalent to the Gospel phrase which tells us that the Father is in the Son. For the Son is true Light, and the truth is unapproachable by falsehood; so then the Son is Light unapproachable in which the Father dwells, or in Whom the Father is.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_30_commentary_on_the_apocalypse_of_the_blessed_john","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"ANF-07","text":"9. \"And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain.\"] He relates that he saw under the altar of God, that is, under the earth, the souls of them that were slain.

We often find in the symbolical passages of Scripture, that the same person appears in different characters on different occasions. So, on this occasion, Moses represents and prefigures the Jewish people as placed under the law. As, then, Moses, when he struck the rock with his rod, doubted the power of God, so the people who were under the law given by Moses, when they nailed Christ to the cross, did not believe Him to be the power of God. And as water flowed from the smitten rock for those that were athirst, so life comes to believers from the stroke of the Lord's passion. The testimony of the apostle is clear and decisive on this point, when he says, \"This rock was Christ.\"[fn-16-P1699_949647:27-nf] In the command of God, that the death of the flesh of Moses should take place on the mountain, we see the divine appointment that the carnal doubt of the divinity of Christ should die on Christ's exaltation. As the rock is Christ, so is the mountain. The rock is the fortitude of His humiliation; the mountain the height of His exaltation. For as the apostle says, \"This rock was Christ,\" so Christ Himself says, \"A city set upon an hill cannot be hid,\"[fn-17-P1700_950119:28-nf] showing that He is the hill, and believers the city built upon the glory of His name.

In this way, he will no longer in a hostile spirit resist so plain a prophecy, but, influenced by the allusion to the Jesus of the Old Testament, he will be prepared to listen meekly to Him whose name he bore, and who leads to the true land of promise; for He says, \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the land.\"[fn-17-P1711_956199:36-nf] The Gentile also, if his heart is not too stony, if he is one of those stones from which God raises up children unto Abraham, must allow it to be wonderful that in the ancient books of the people of whom Jesus was born, so plain a prophecy, including His very name, is found recorded; and must remark at the same time, that it is not any many of the name of Jesus who is prophesied, of, but a divine person, because God said that His name was in that man who was appointed to rule the people, and to lead them into the kingdom, and who by a change of name was called Jesus. In His being sent with this new name, He brings a great and divine message, and is therefore called an Angel, which, as every tyro in Greek knows, means messenger. No Gentile, therefore, it he were not perverse and obstinate, would despise these books merely because be is not subject to the law of the Hebrews, to whom the books belong; but would think highly of the books, no matter whose they were, on finding in them prophecies of such ancient date, and of what he sees now taking place. Instead of despising Christ Jesus because He is foretold in the Hebrew Scriptures, he would conclude that one thought worthy of being the subject of prophetic description, whoever the writers might be, for so many ages before His coming into the world,-sometimes in plain announcements, sometimes in figure by symbolic actions and utterances,-must claim to be regarded with profound admiration and reverence, and to be followed with implicit reliance.

All this is recorded almost in the same language also by Mark, only that he has not put in so general a form what the Lord said with regard to the manner in which the event [of Peter's failure] was to be brought about, but has given it a more particular turn. For his version is this: \"Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice; thou shalt deny me thrice.\"[fn-22-P2275_961346:26-nf] Thus it appears that all of them tell us how the Lord foretold that Peter would deny Him before the cock crew, but that they do not all mention how often the cock was to crow, and that Mark is the only one who has presented a more explicit notice of this incident in the narrative. Hence some are of opinion that Mark's statement is not in harmony with those of the others. But this is simply because they do not give sufficient attention to the facts of the case, and, above all, because they approach the question under the cloud of a prejudiced mind, in consequence of their being possessed by a hostile disposition towards the gospel. The fact is, that Peter's denial, when taken as a whole, is a threefold denial. For he remained in the same state of mental agitation, and harboured the same mendacious intention, until what had been foretold regarding him was brought to his mind, and healing came to him by bitter weeping and sorrow of heart. It is evident, however, that if this complete denial-that is to say, the threefold denial-is taken to have commenced only after the first crowing of the cock, three of the evangelists will appear to have given an incorrect account of the matter. For Matthew's version is this: \"Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice;\" and Luke puts it thus: \"I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me;\" and John presents it in this form: \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.\" And thus, in different terms and with words introduced in diverse successions, these three evangelists have expressed one and the same sense as conveyed by the words which the Lord spake-namely, the fact that, before the cock should crow, Peter was to deny Him thrice. On the other hand, if [we suppose that] he went through the whole triple denial before the cock began to crow at all, then Mark will be made to underlie the charge of having given a superfluous statement when he puts these words into the Lord's mouth: \"Verily I say unto thee, That this day, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice.\" For to what purpose would it be to say, \"before the cock crow twice,\" when, on the supposition that this entire threefold denial was gone through previous to the first crowing of the cock, it is self-evident that a negation, which would thus be proved to have been completed before the first cockcrow, must also, as matter of course, be understood to have been fully uttered before the second cockcrow and before the third, and, in short, before all the cockcrowings which took place on that same night? But, inasmuch as this threefold denial was begun previous to the first crowing of the cock, those three evangelists concerned themselves with noticing, not the time at which Peter was to complete it, but the extent[fn-22-P2276_964535:27-nf] to which it was to be carried, and the period at which it was to commence; that is to say, their object was to bring out the facts that it was to be thrice repeated, and that it was to begin previous to the cockcrowing. At the same time, so far as the man's own mind is concerned, we might also quite well understand it to have been engaged in, as a whole, previous to the first cockcrow. For although it is true that, so far as regards the actual utterance of the individual who was guilty of the denial, that threefold negation was only entered upon previous to the first cockcrow, and really finished before the second cockcrow, still it is equally true that, in so far as the disposition of mind and the apprehensions indulged by Peter were concerned, it was conceived,[fn-22-P2277_965451:28-nf] as a whole, before the first cockcrow. Neither is it a matter of any consequence of what duration those intervals of delay were which elapsed between the several utterances of that thrice-recurring voice, if it is the case that the denial completely possessed his heart even previous to the first cockcrow,-in consequence, indeed, of his having imbibed a spirit of terror so abject as to make him capable of denying the Lord when he was questioned regarding Him, not only once, but a second time, and even a third time. Thus, a more correct and careful consideration of the matter might show us[fn-22-P2278_966131:29-nf] that, precisely as it is declared that the man who looketh on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart,[fn-22-P2279_966455:30-nf] so, in the present instance, inasmuch as in the words which he spoke, Peter merely expressed the apprehension which he had already conceived with such intensity in his mind as to make it capable of enduring even on to a third repetition of his denial of the Lord, this threefold negation is to be assigned as a whole to that particular period at which the fear that sufficed thus to carry him on to a threefold denial took possession of him. In this way, too, it may be made apparent that, even if the words in which the denial was couched began to break forth from him only after the first cockcrow, when his heart was smitten by the inquiries addressed to him, it would involve neither any absurdity nor any untruthfulness, although it were said that before the cock crew he denied Him thrice, seeing that, in any case, previous to the crowing of the cock, his mind had been assailed by an apprehension violent enough to be able to draw him[fn-22-P2280_967416:31-nf] on even to a third denial. All the less, therefore, ought we to feel any difficulty in the matter, if it appears that the threefold denial, as expressed also in the thrice-recurring utterances of the person who made the denial, was entered upon previous to the crowing of the cock, although it was not completed before the first cockcrow. We may take a parallel case, and suppose an intimation to be made to the following effect to a person: \"This night, before the cock crow, you will write a letter to me, in which you will revile me thrice.\" Well, surely in this instance, if the man began to write the letter] before the cock had crowed at all, and finished it after the cock had crowed for the first time,that would be no reason for alleging that the intimation previously made was false. The fact, therefore, is that, in putting these words into the Lord's lips, \"Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice,\" Mark has given us a plainer indication of the intervals of time which separated the utterances themselves. And when we come to the said section of the evangelical narrative, we shall see that the circumstances are presented in a manner which exhibits, in that connection also, the harmony subsisting among the evangelists.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_28_homily_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Which accordingly He doth here also; for through so many words as He hath spent He ceases not to set Him before us, admiring His wisdom, His providence, His tender care extending through all things, both great and small.

This is proved by the words that follow: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.

Again, how weighty are the things which this evangelist reports Jesus to have spoken, when He came back to the temple from Mount Olivet, and after the forgiveness which He extended to the adulteress, who had been brought before Him by His tempters, as one deserving to be stoned: on which occasion He wrote with His finger upon the ground, as if He would indicate that people of the character of these men would be written on earth, and not in heaven, as He also admonished His disciples to rejoice that their names were written in heaven![fn-28-P2837_1255716:62-nf] Or, it may be that He meant to convey the idea that it was by humbling Himself (which He expressed by bending down His head) that He wrought signs upon the earth; or, that the time was now come when His law should be written, not, as formerly, on the sterile stone, but on a soil which would yield fruit. Accordingly, after these incidents, He affirmed Himself to be the light of the world, and declared that be who followed Him would not walk in darkness, but would have the light of life. He said, also, that He was \"the beginning which also discoursed to them.\"[fn-28-P2838_1256406:63-nf] By which designation He clearly distinguished Himself from the light which He made, and presented Himself as the Light by which all things have been made.

There arises further in this connection a question about angels. For they are happy in the enjoyment of Him whom we long to enjoy; and the more we enjoy Him in this life as through a glass darkly, the more easy do we find it to bear our pilgrimage, and the more eagerly do we long for its termination. But it is not irrational to ask whether in those two commandments is included the love of angels also. For that He who commanded us to love our neighbor made no exception, as far as men are concerned, is shown both by our Lord Himself in the Gospel, and by the Apostle Paul. For when the man to whom our Lord delivered those two commandments, and to whom He said that on these hang all the law and the prophets, asked Him, \"And who is my neighbor?\" He told him of a certain man who, going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, fell among thieves, and was severely wounded by them, and left naked and half dead.[fn-47-P4755_2593191:23-nf] And He showed him that nobody was neighbor to this man except him who took pity upon him and came forward to relieve and care for him. And the man who had asked the question admitted the truth of this when he was himself interrogated in turn. To whom our Lord says, \"Go and do thou likewise;\" teaching us that he is our neighbor whom it is our duty to help in his need, or whom it would be our duty to help if he were in need. Whence it follows, that he whose duty it would be in turn to help us is our neighbor. For the name \"neighbor\" is a relative one, and no one can be neighbor except to a neighbor. And, again, who does not see that no exception is made of any one as a person to whom the offices of mercy may be denied when our Lord extends the rule even to our enemies? \"Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you.\"[fn-47-P4756_2594044:24-nf] ","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_121_treatise_xi_exhortation_to_martyrdom_addressed_to_fortunatus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The Holy Spirit shows and predicts by Solomon, saying: \"And although in the sight of men they suffered torments, yet their hope is full of immortality.

For neither is that committed because of marriage, but is pardoned because of marriage. Therefore married persons owe one another not only the faith of their sexual intercourse itself, for the begetting of children, which is the first fellowship of the human kind in this mortal state; but also, in a way, a mutual service of sustaining[fn-37-P3760_1776881:14-nf] one another's weakness, in order to shun unlawful intercourse: so that, although perpetual continence be pleasing to one of them, he may not, save with consent of the other.

For intercourse of marriage for the sake of begetting hath not fault; but for the satisfying of lust, but yet with husband or wife, by reason of the faith of the bed, it hath venial fault: but adultery or fornication hath deadly fault, and, through this, continence from all intercourse is indeed better even than the intercourse of marriage itself, which takes place for the sake of begetting. But because that Continence is of larger desert, but to pay the due of marriage is no crime, but to demand it beyond the necessity of begetting is a venial fault, but to commit fornication or adultery is a crime to be punished; charity of the married ought to beware, lest whilst it seek for itself occasion of larger honor, it do that for its partner which cause condemnation. \"For whosoever putteth away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery.\"[fn-37-P3762_1778451:16-nf] To such a degree is that marriage compact entered upon a matter of a certain sacrament, that it is not made void even by separation itself, since, so long as her husband lives, even by whom she hath been left, she commits adultery, in case she be married to another: and he who hath left her, is the cause of this evil.","title":"On the Good of Marriage.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the Father \"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-78-P7832_2232206:646-nf] it must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom. For he in a previous verse ascribed sin to the flesh, and made it out to be \"the law of sin dwelling in his members,\" and \"warring against the law of the mind.\"[fn-78-P7833_2232476:647-nf] On this account, therefore, (does he mean to say that) the Son was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might redeem this sinful flesh by a like substance, even a fleshly one, which bare a resemblance to sinful flesh, although it was itself free from sin. Now this will be the very perfection of divine power to effect the salvation (of man) in a nature like his own,[fn-78-P7834_2232890:648-nf] For it would be no great matter if the Spirit of God remedied the flesh; but when a flesh, which is the very copy[fn-78-P7835_2233017:649-nf] of the sinning substance-itself flesh also-only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a great thing). The likeness, therefore, will have reference to the quality[fn-78-P7836_2233215:650-nf] of the sinfulness, and not to any falsity[fn-78-P7837_2233273:651-nf] of the substance. Because he would not have added the attribute \"sinful,\"[fn-78-P7838_2233365:652-nf] if he meant the \"likeness\" to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case he would only have used the word \"flesh,\" and omitted the \"sinful.\" But inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said \"sinful flesh,\" (or \"flesh of sin,\")[fn-78-P7839_2234360:653-nf] he has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose[fn-78-P7840_2234533:654-nf] that the likeness was predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition[fn-78-P7841_2234765:655-nf] with our own; but true still, as being of a nature[fn-78-P7842_2234831:656-nf] not really unlike ours.[fn-78-P7843_2235083:657-nf] And again, in contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness. The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he would not have us \"live in the flesh,\" although in the flesh-even by not living in the works of the flesh[fn-78-P7846_2236549:660-nf] -he shows that when he wrote the words, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-78-P7847_2236670:661-nf] it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,[fn-78-P7848_2236925:662-nf] not on the substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if \"the body indeed is dead because of sin\" (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the body), \"but the spirit is life because of righteousness,\"[fn-78-P7849_2237246:663-nf] it follows that this life accrues to that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the body[fn-78-P7850_2237401:664-nf] is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: \"He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\"[fn-78-P7851_2237664:665-nf] In these words he both affirmed the resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called[fn-78-P7852_2237793:666-nf] body, nor can anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God. So says the Creator's Psalmist: \"It is better to hope in the Lord, than to hope even in princes.\"[fn-78-P7870_2243623:684-nf] \"Patient in tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7871_2243671:685-nf] You have (this in) the Psalm: \"The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7872_2243770:686-nf] \"Bless, and curse not,\"[fn-78-P7873_2243812:687-nf] (says your apostle.) But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things, and blessed them? \"Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\"[fn-78-P7874_2244046:688-nf] For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces a woe.[fn-78-P7875_2244123:689-nf] \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\"[fn-78-P7876_2244180:690-nf] (Like unto which is the Creator's precept: ) \"Thou shalt not remember thy brother's evil against thee.\"[fn-78-P7877_2244305:691-nf] (Again: ) \"Avenge not yourselves; \"[fn-78-P7878_2244366:692-nf] for it is written, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"[fn-78-P7879_2244457:693-nf] \"Live peaceably with all men.\"[fn-78-P7880_2244538:694-nf] The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense. Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion's god (after all).[fn-78-P7882_2245034:696-nf] If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator's Christ, what is the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it? \"[fn-78-P7883_2245389:697-nf] In vain has (our man of) Pontus laboured to deny this statement.[fn-78-P7884_2245474:698-nf] If the gospel has not fulfilled the law, then all I can say is,[fn-78-P7885_2245698:699-nf] the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"3. As \"the law and the prophets\" may have three different meanings, it is uncertain in what sense the words are used by Jesus, though we may form a conjecture from what follows. For if Jesus had gone on to speak of circumcision, and Sabbaths, and sacrifices, and the observances of the Hebrews, and had added something as a fulfillment, there could have been no doubt that it was the law and the prophets of the Jews of which He said that He came not, to destroy, but to fulfill them. But Christ, without any allusion to these, speaks only of commandments which date from the earliest times: \"Thou shall not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not bear false witness.\" These, it can be proved, were of old promulgated in the world by Enoch and Seth, and the other righteous men, to whom the precepts were delivered by angels of lofty rank, in order to tame the savage nature of men. From this it appears that Jesus spoke of the law and the prophets of truth. And so we find him giving a fulfillment of those precepts already quoted. \"Ye have heard,\" He says, \"that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; but I say unto you, Be not even angry.\" This is the fulfillment. Again: \"Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, Do not lust even.\" This is the fulfillment. Again: \"It has been said, Thou shalt not bear false witness; but I say unto you, Swear not.\" This too is the fulfillment. He thus both confirms the old precepts and supplies their defects. Where He seems to speak of some Jewish precepts, instead of fulfilling them, He substitutes for them precepts of an opposite tendency. He proceeds thus: \"Ye have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" This is not fulfillment, but destruction. Again: \"It has been said, Thou shall love thy friend, and hate thine enemy; but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for your persecutors.\" This too is destruction. Again: \"It has been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement; but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery, and is himself an adulterer if he afterwards marries another woman.\"[fn-18-P1820_1022891:7-nf] These precepts are evidently destroyed because they are the precepts of Moses; while the others are fulfilled because they are the precepts of the righteous men of antiquity. If you agree to this explanation, we may allow that Jesus said that he came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. If you disapprove of this explanation, give one of your own. Only beware of making Jesus a liar, and of making yourself a Jew, by binding yourself to fulfill the law because Christ did not destroy it.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"18. The Manichaeans, therefore have no ground for saying, in disparagement of the law and the prophets, that Christ crime to destroy rather than to fulfill them, because Christians do not observe what is there enjoined: for the only things which they do not observe are those that prefigured Christ, and these are not observed because their fulfillment is in Christ, and what is fulfilled is no longer prefigured; the typical observances having properly come to a close in the time of those who, after being trained in such things, had come to believe in Christ as their fulfillment. Do not Christians observe the precept of Scripture \"Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God;\" \"Thou shalt not image,\" and so on? Do make Christians not observe the precept, \"Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain?\" Do Christians not observe the Sabbath, even in the sense of a true rest? Do Christians not honor their parents, according to the commandment? Do Christians not abstain from fornication, and murder. and theft, and false witness, from coveting their neighbor's wife, and from coveting his property,-all of which things are written in the law? These moral precepts are distinct from typical sacraments: the former are fulfilled by the aid of divine grace, the latter by the accomplishment of what they promise. Both are fulfilled in Christ, who has ever been the bestower of this grace, which is also now revealed in Him, and who now makes manifest the accomplishment of what He in former times promised; for \"the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1866_1054316:38-nf] Again, these things which concern the keeping of a good conscience are fulfilled in the faith which worketh by love;[fn-18-P1867_1054450:39-nf] while types of the future pass away when they are accomplished.

Faustus, therefore, is wrong in supposing that the Lord Jesus fulfilled some precepts of righteous men who lived before the law of Moses, such as, \"Thou shall not kill,\" which Christ did not oppose, but rather confirmed by His prohibition of anger and abuse; and that He destroyed some things apparently peculiar to the Hebrew law, such as, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\" which Christ. seems rather to abolish than to confirm, when He says, \"But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any one smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,\"[fn-18-P1868_1055260:40-nf] and so on.

To take, for instance, this saying of the ancients, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy,\" how does Faustus make cut that this is peculiar to Moses? Does not the Apostle Paul speak of some men as hateful to God?[fn-18-P1877_1062666:44-nf] And, indeed, in connection with this saying, the Lord enjoins on us that we should imitate God. His words are: \"That ye may be the children of your Father in heaven, who maketh the sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.\"[fn-18-P1878_1062950:45-nf] In ore sense we must hate our enemies, after the example of God, to whom Paul says some men are hateful; while, at the same time, we must also love our enemies after the example of God, who makes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. If we understand this, we shall find that the Lord, in explaining to those who did not rightly understand the saying, Thou shalt hate thine enemy, made use of it to show that they should love their enemy, which was a new idea to them. It would take too long to show the consistency of the two things here. But when the Manichaeans condemn without exception the precept, Thou shall hate thine enemy, they may easily be met with the question whether their god loves the race of darkness. Or, if we should love our enemies now, because they have a part of good, should we not also hate them as having a part of evil? So even in this way it would appear that there is no opposition between the saying of ancient times, Thou shall hate thine enemy, and that of the Gospel, Love your enemies. For every wicked man should be hated as far as he is wicked; while he should be loved as a man. The vice which we rightly hate in him is to be condemned, that by its removal the human nature which we rightly love in him may be amended. This is precisely the principle we maintain, that we should hate our enemy for what is evil in him, that is, for his wickedness; while we also love our enemy for that which is good in him, that is, for his nature as a social and rational being. The difference between us and the Manichaeans is, that we prove the man to be wicked, not by nature, either his own or any other, but by his own will; whereas they think that a man is evil on account of the nature of the race of darkness, which, according to them, was an object of dread to God when he existed entire, and by which also he was partly conquered, so that he cannot be entirely set free. The intention of the Lord, then, is to correct those who, from knowing without understanding what was said by them of old time, Thou shalt hate thine enemy, hated their fellow-men instead of only hating their wickedness; and for this purpose He says, Love your enemies. Instead of destroying what is written about hatred of enemies in the law, of which He said, \"I am come not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it,\" He would have us learn, from the duty of loving our enemies, how it is possible in the case of one and the same person, both to hate him for his sin, and to love him for his nature. It is too much to expect our perverse opponents to understand this. But we can silence them, by showing that by their irrational objection they condemn their own god, of whom they cannot say that he loves the race of darkness; so that in enjoining on every one to love his enemy, they cannot quote his example. There would appear to be more love of their enemy in the race of darkness than in the god of the Manichaeans. The story is, that the race of darkness coveted the domain of light bordering on their territory, and, from a desire to possess it, formed the plan of invading it. Nor is there any sin in desiring true goodness and blessedness. For the Lord says, \"The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.\"[fn-18-P1879_1066266:46-nf] This fabulous race of darkness, then, wished to take by force the good they desired, for its beautiful and attractive appearance. But God, instead of returning the love of those who wished to possess Him, hated it so as to endeavor to annihilate them. If, therefore, the evil love the good in the desire to possess it, while the good hate the evil in fear of being defiled, I ask the Manichaeans, which of these obeys the precept of the Lord, \"Love your enemies\"? If you insist on making these precepts opposed to one another, it will follow that your god obeyed what is written in the law of Moses, \"Thou shall hate thine enemy\"; while the race of darkness obeyed what is written in the Gospel, \"Love your enemies.\" However, you have never succeeded in explaining the difference between the flies that fly in the day-time and the moths that fly at night; for both, according to you, belong to the race of darkness. How is it that one kind love the light, contrary to their nature; while the other kind avoid it, and prefer the darkness from which they sprung?

Nor, again, is there any opposition between that which was said by them of old time, \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" and what the Lord says, \"But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any one smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,\" and so on[fn-18-P1881_1067709:47-nf] The old precept as well as the new is intended to check the vehemence of hatred, and to curb the impetuosity of angry passion. For who will of his own accord be satisfied with a revenge equal to the injury? Do we not see men, only slightly hurt, eager for slaughter, thirsting for blood, as if they could never make their enemy suffer enough? If a man receives a blow, does he not summon his assailant, that he may be condemned in the court of law? Or if he prefers to return the blow, does he not fall upon the man with hand and heel, or perhaps with a weapon, if he can get hold of one? To put a restraint upon a revenge so unjust from its excess, the law established the principle of compensation, that the penalty should correspond to the injury inflicted. So the precept, \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" instead of being a brand to kindle a fire that was quenched, was rather a covering to prevent the fire already kindled from spreading. For there is a just revenge due to the injured person from his assailant; so that when we pardon, we give up what we might justly claim. Thus, in the Lord's prayer, we are taught to forgive others their debts that God may forgive us our debts. There is no injustice in asking back a debt, though there is kindness in forgiving it. But as, in swearing, one who swears, even though truly, is in danger of perjury, of which one is in no danger who never swears; and while swearing truly is not a sin, we are further. from sin by not swearing; so that the command not to swear is a guard against perjury: in the same way since it is sinful to wish to be revenged with an unjust excess, though there is no sin in wishing for revenge within the limits of justice, the man who wishes for no revenge at all is further from the sin of an unjust revenge. It is sin to demand more than is due, though it is no sin to demand a debt. And the best security against the sin of making an unjust demand is to demand nothing, especially considering the danger of being compelled to pay the debt to Him who is in debted to none. Thus, I would explain the passage as follows: It has been said by them of old time, Thou shall not take unjust revenge; but I say, Take no revenge at all: here is the fulfillment. It is thus that Faustus, after quoting,\" It has been said, Thou shall not swear falsely; but I say unto you, swear not at all,\" adds: here is the fulfillment. I might use the same expression if I thought that by the addition of these words Christ supplied a defect in the law, and not rather that the intention of the law to prevent unjust revenge is best secured by not taking revenge at all, in the same way as the intention to prevent perjury is best secured by not swearing at all.

Nor, again, is there any opposition between that which was said by them of old time, \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" and what the Lord says, \"But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any one smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,\" and so on[fn-18-P1881_1067709:47-nf] The old precept as well as the new is intended to check the vehemence of hatred, and to curb the impetuosity of angry passion. For who will of his own accord be satisfied with a revenge equal to the injury? Do we not see men, only slightly hurt, eager for slaughter, thirsting for blood, as if they could never make their enemy suffer enough? If a man receives a blow, does he not summon his assailant, that he may be condemned in the court of law? Or if he prefers to return the blow, does he not fall upon the man with hand and heel, or perhaps with a weapon, if he can get hold of one? To put a restraint upon a revenge so unjust from its excess, the law established the principle of compensation, that the penalty should correspond to the injury inflicted. So the precept, \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" instead of being a brand to kindle a fire that was quenched, was rather a covering to prevent the fire already kindled from spreading. For there is a just revenge due to the injured person from his assailant; so that when we pardon, we give up what we might justly claim. Thus, in the Lord's prayer, we are taught to forgive others their debts that God may forgive us our debts. There is no injustice in asking back a debt, though there is kindness in forgiving it. But as, in swearing, one who swears, even though truly, is in danger of perjury, of which one is in no danger who never swears; and while swearing truly is not a sin, we are further. from sin by not swearing; so that the command not to swear is a guard against perjury: in the same way since it is sinful to wish to be revenged with an unjust excess, though there is no sin in wishing for revenge within the limits of justice, the man who wishes for no revenge at all is further from the sin of an unjust revenge. It is sin to demand more than is due, though it is no sin to demand a debt. And the best security against the sin of making an unjust demand is to demand nothing, especially considering the danger of being compelled to pay the debt to Him who is in debted to none. Thus, I would explain the passage as follows: It has been said by them of old time, Thou shall not take unjust revenge; but I say, Take no revenge at all: here is the fulfillment. It is thus that Faustus, after quoting,\" It has been said, Thou shall not swear falsely; but I say unto you, swear not at all,\" adds: here is the fulfillment. I might use the same expression if I thought that by the addition of these words Christ supplied a defect in the law, and not rather that the intention of the law to prevent unjust revenge is best secured by not taking revenge at all, in the same way as the intention to prevent perjury is best secured by not swearing at all.

Again, we shall find on examination, that there is no opposition between the precept of the Lord about not putting away a wife, and what was said by them of old time: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.\"[fn-18-P1885_1071904:49-nf] The Lord explains the intention of the law, which required a bill of divorce in every case where a wife was put away. The precept not to put away a wife is the opposite of saying that a man may put away his wife if he pleases; which is not what the law says. On the contrary, to prevent the wife from being put away, the law required this intermediate step, that the eagerness for separation might be checked by the writing of the bill, and the man might have time to think of the evil of putting away his wife; especially since, as it is said, among the Hebrews it was unlawful for any but the scribes to write Hebrew: for the scribes claimed the possession of superior wisdom; and if they were men of upright and pious character, their pursuits might justly entitle them to make this claim. In requiring, therefore, that in putting away his wife, a man should give her a writing of divorcement, the design was that he should be obliged to have recourse to those from whom he might expect to receive a cautious interpretation of the law, and suitable advice against separation. Having no other way of getting the bill written, the man should be obliged to submit to their direction, and to allow of their endeavors to restore peace and harmony between him and his wife. In a case where the hatred could not be overcome or checked, the bill would of course be written A wife might with reason be put away when wise counsel failed to restore the proper feeling and affection in the mind of her husband. If the wife is not loved, she is to be put away. And that she may not be put away, it is the husband's duty to love her. Now, while a man cannot be forced to love against his will, he may be influenced by advice and persuasion. This was the duty of the scribe, as a wise and upright man; and the law gave him the opportunity, by requiring the husband in all cases of quarrel to go to him, to get the bill of divorcement written. No good or prudent man would write the bill unless it were a case of such obstinate aversion as to make reconciliation impossible. But according to your impious notions, there can be nothing in putting away a wife; for matrimony, according to you, is a criminal indulgence. The word \"matrimony\" shows that a man takes a wife in order that she may become a mother, which would be an evil in your estimation. According to you, this would imply that part of your god is overcome and captured by the race of darkness, and bound in the fetters of flesh.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"28.

In connection also with our imitating God in refraining from taking revenge, and in loving even the wicked, there is a passage containing a full description of God in this character; for it is written: \"To Thee alone ever belongeth great strength, and who can withstand the power of Thine arm? For the whole world before Thee is as a little grain of the balance; yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon the earth. But Thou hast mercy upon all, for Thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because of repentance. For Thou lovest all things that are, and abhorrest nothing which Thou hast made; for never wouldest Thou have made anything if Thou hadst hated it. And how could anything have endured, if it had not been Thy will? or been preserved, if not called by Thee? But Thou sparest all; for they are Thine, O Lord, Thou lover of souls. For Thy good Spirit is in all things; therefore chastenest Thou them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended, that learning their wickedness, they may believe in Thee, O Lord.\"[fn-19-P1900_1078570:62-nf] Christ exhorts us to imitate this long-suffering goodness of God, who maketh the sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust; that we may not be careful to revenge, but may do good to them that hate us, and so may be perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect.[fn-19-P1901_1078907:63-nf] From another passage in these ancient books we learn that, by not exacting the vengeance due to us, we obtain the remission of our own sins; and that by not forgiving the debts of others, we incur the danger of being refused forgiveness when we pray for the remission of our own debts: \"He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep his sin in remembrance. Forgive thy neighbor the hurt that he hath done to thee; so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest. One man beareth hatred against another, and cloth he seek pardon of the Lord? He showeth no mercy to a man who is like himself; and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins?

And at this stage he exercises himself diligently in the love of his neighbor; and when he has reached the point of loving his enemy, full of hopes and unbroken in strength, he mounts to the sixth step, in which he purifies the eye itself which can see God,[fn-48-P4849_2625794:10-nf] so far as God can be seen by those who as far as possible die to this world.

Whence also is that of the Prophet, \"The Lord is very high, and hath respect unto things that are lowly: but what are very high He noteth afar off;\"[fn-39-P3987_1895735:83-nf] assuredly as not coming unto Him.

And assuredly the Pharisee was rendering thanks unto God by reason of those things wherein he was greatly self-satisfied. \"I render thanks to Thee,\" saith he, \"that I am not even as the rest of men, unjust, extortioners, adulterers, even as also this publican.

But the Publican was standing afar off, not daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven, but beating his breast, saying, God be merciful unto me a sinner.\" But there follows the divine judgment, \"Verily I say unto you, the Publican went down from the Temple justified more than that Pharisee.\"[fn-39-P3990_1897144:86-nf] Then the cause is shown, why this is just; \"Forasmuch as he who exalteth himself shall be humbled, and whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.\" Therefore it may come to pass, that each one both shun real evils, and reflect on real goods in himself, and render thanks for these unto \"the Father of lights, from Whom cometh down every best gift, and every perfect gift,\"[fn-39-P3991_1897538:87-nf] and yet be rejected by reason of the sin of haughtiness, if through pride, even in his thought alone, which is before God, he insult other sinners, and specially when confessing their sins in prayer, unto whom is due not upbraiding with arrogance, but pity without despair. What is it that, when His disciples were questioning among themselves, who of them should be greater, He set a little child before their eyes, saying, \"Unless ye shall be as this child, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?\"[fn-39-P3992_1898064:88-nf] Did He not chiefly commend humility, and set in it the desert of greatness? Or when unto the sons of Zebedee desiring to be at His side in lofty seats He so made answer,[fn-39-P3993_1898257:89-nf] as that they should rather think of having to drink the Cup of His Passion, wherein He humbled Himself even unto death, even the death of the Cross,[fn-39-P3994_1898429:90-nf] than with proud desire demand to be preferred to the rest; what did He show, save, that He would be a bestower of exaltation upon them, who should first follow Him as a teacher of humility? And now, in that, when about to go forth unto His Passion, He washed the feet of His disciples, and most openly taught them to do for their fellow-disciples and fellow-servants this, which He their Lord and Master had done for them; how greatly did He commend humility?[fn-39-P3995_1898908:91-nf] And in order to commend this He chose also that time, wherein they were looking on Him, as immediately about to die, with great longing; assuredly about to retain in their memory this especially, which their Master, Whom they were to imitate, had pointed out to them as the last thing. But He did this at that time, which surely He could have done on other days also before, wherein He had been conversant with them; at which time if it were done, this same would indeed be delivered, but certainly would not be so received.","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_12_tractate_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. \"The next day, John stood, and two of his disciples; and looking upon Jesus as He walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!\" Assuredly, in a special sense, the Lamb; for the disciples were also called lambs: \"Behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.\"[fn-5-P510_212989:7-nf] They were also called light: \"Ye are the light of the world; \"[fn-5-P511_213068:8-nf] but in another sense is He called so, concerning whom it was said, \"That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-5-P512_213231:9-nf] In like manner was He called the dove in a special sense, alone without stain, without sin; not one whose sins have been washed away, but One who never had stain.

Indeed in all spiritual delights, which unmarried women enjoy, their holy conversation ought also to be with caution; lest haply, though their life be not evil through haughtiness, their report be evil through negligence. Nor are they to be listened to, whether they be holy men or women, when (upon occasion of their neglect in some matter being blamed, through which it comes to pass that they fall into evil suspicion, from which they know that their life is far removed) they say that it is enough for them their conscience before God, despising what men think of them, not only imprudently[fn-42-P4232_2006650:73-nf] but also cruelly; when they slay the souls of others; whether of such as blaspheme the way of God, who following their suspicion are displeased at what is the chaste life of the Saints, as though, it were shameful, or of such also as make excuse, and imitate, not what they see, but what they think. Wherefore whosoever guards his life from charges of shameful and evil deeds, does good to himself; but whosoever guards his character too, is merciful also towards others. For unto ourselves our ownlife is necessary, unto others our character;and certainly even what we mercifully minister unto others, for their health, abounds also to our own profit. Whence not in vain the Apostle, \"We provide good things,\" saith he, \"not only before God, but also before men;\"[fn-42-P4233_2007462:74-nf] also he saith, \"Please ye all men through all things; even as I also please all men through all things, not seeking what is of profit unto myself, but what unto many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-42-P4234_2007688:75-nf] Also in a certain exhortation he says, \"For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are most dear whatsoever things are of good report; if any virtue, if any praise, these things think on, which ye have both learned, and received, arid heard, and seen in me.\"[fn-42-P4235_2008077:76-nf] You see howl among many things, unto which by exhortation he admonished them, he neglected not to set, \"whatsoever things are of good report;\" and in two words included all things, where he saith, \"if any virtue, if any praise.\" For unto virtue pertain the good things of which He made mention above; but good report unto praise. I think that the Apostle took not the praise of men for any great thing, saying in another place, \"But to me it is the least thing, that I be judged of you, or of day of man;\"[fn-42-P4236_2008604:77-nf] and in another place, \"If I were pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ;\"[fn-42-P4237_2008708:78-nf] and again, \"For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-42-P4238_2008794:79-nf] But of these two, that is, of a good life, and a good report, or as is said more shortly, of virtue and praise, the one for his own sake he most wisely kept, the other for the sake of others he most mercifully provided. But, forasmuch as human caution, how great soever, cannot on every side avoid most malevolent suspicions, when for our good report we shall have done whatever we rightly can, if any, either by falsely pretending evil things of us, or from believing evil of us, endeavor to stain our fair fame, let there be present the solace of conscience, and clearly also the joy, in that our reward is great in Heaven, even when men say many evil things of us,[fn-42-P4239_2009481:80-nf] and we yet live godly and righteously.

Which sort of lie is upon no compensation whatever to be gone into, and is utterly and before all to be eschewed.

Supposing that the two free wives point to the New Testament, by which we are called to liberty, what is the meaning of there being two? Perhaps because in Scripture, as the attentive reader will find, we are said to have two lives in the body of Christ,-one temporal, in which we suffer pain, and one eternal, in which we shall behold the blessedness of God. We see the one in the Lord's passion, and the other in His resurrection. The names of the women point to this meaning: It is said that Leah means Suffering, and Rachel the First Principle made visible, or the Word which makes the First Principle visible. The action, then, of our mortal human life, in which we live by faith, doing many painful tasks without knowing what benefit may result from them to those in whom we are interested, is Leah, Jacob's first wife. And thus she is said to have had weak eyes. For the purposes of mortals are timid, and our plans uncertain. Again, the hope of the eternal contemplation of God, accompanied with a sure and delightful perception of truth, is Rachel. And on this account she is described as fair and well-formed. This is the beloved of every pious student, and for this he serves the grace of God, by which our sins, though like scarlet, are made white as snow.[fn-21-P2153_1288773:83-nf] For Laban means making white; and we read that Jacob served Laban for Rachel.[fn-21-P2154_1288868:84-nf] No man turns to serve righteousness, in subjection to the grace of forgiveness, but that he may live in peace in the Word which makes visible the First Principle, or God; that is, he serves for Rachel, not for Leah. For what a man loves in the works of righteousness is not the toil of doing and suffering. No one desires this life for its own sake; as Jacob desired not Leah, who yet was brought to him, and became his wife, and the mother of children. Though she could not be loved of herself, the Lord made her be borne with as a step to Rachel; and then she came to be approved of on account of her children. Thus every useful servant of God, brought into His grace by which his sins are made white, has in his mind, and heart, and affection, when he thus turns to God, nothing but the knowledge of wisdom. This we often expect to attain as a reward for practising the seven precepts of the law which concern the love of our neighbor, that we injure no one: namely, Honor thy father and mother; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shall not kill; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shall not bear false witness; Thou shalt not desire thy neighbor's wife; Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's property. When a man has obeyed these to the best of his ability, and, instead of the bright joys of truth which he desired and hoped for, finds in the darkness of the manifold trials of this world that he is bound to painful endurance, or has embraced Leah instead of Rachel, if there is perseverance in his love, he bears with the one in order to attain the other; and as if it were said to him, Serve seven other years for Rachel, he hears seven new commands,-to be poor in spirit, to be meek, to be a mourner, to hunger and thirst after righteousness, to be merciful, pure, and a peacemaker.[fn-21-P2155_1290672:85-nf] A man would desire, if it were possible, to obtain at once the joys of lovely and perfect wisdom, without the endurance of toil in action and suffering; but this is impossible in mortal life. This seems to be meant, when it is said to Jacob: \"It is not the custom in our country to marry the younger before the elder.\"[fn-21-P2156_1291010:86-nf] The elder may very well mean the first in order of time. So, in the discipline of man, the toil of doing the work of righteousness precedes the delight of understanding the truth.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"76. If it is supposed that God could not enjoin warfare, because in after times it was said by the Lord Jesus Christ, \"I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but if any one strike thee on the right cheek, turn to him the left also,\"[fn-22-P2225_1338094:131-nf] the answer is, that what is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart, and such were the hearts of our fathers, the righteous men of old. But order required such a regulation of events, and such a distinction of times, as to show first of all that even earthly blessings (for so temporal kingdoms and victory over enemies are considered to be, and these are the things which the community of the ungodly all over the world are continually begging from idols and devils) are entirely under the control and at the disposal of the one true God. Thus, under the Old Testament, the secret of the kingdom of heaven, which was to be disclosed in due time, was veiled, and so far obscured, in the disguise of earthly promises. But when the fullness of time came for the revelation of the New Testament, which was hidden under the types of the Old, clear testimony was to be borne to the truth, that there is another life for which this life ought to be disregarded, and another kingdom for which the opposition of all earthly kingdoms should be patiently borne. Thus the name martyrs, which means witnesses, was given to those who, by the will of God, bore this testimony, by their confessions, their sufferings, and their death. The number of such witnesses is so great, that if it pleased Christ-who called Saul by a voice from heaven, and having changed him from a wolf to a sheep, sent him into the midst of wolves-to unite them all in one army, and to give them success in battle, as He gave to the Hebrews, what nation could withstand them? what kingdom would remain unsubdued? But as the doctrine of the New Testament is, that we must serve God not for temporal happiness in this life, but for eternal felicity hereafter, this truth was most strikingly confirmed by the patient endurance of what is commonly called adversity for the sake of that felicity. So in fullness of time the Son of God, made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law, made of the seed of David according to the flesh sends His disciples as sheep into the midst of wolves, and bids them not fear those that can kill the body, but cannot kill the soul, and promises that even the body will be entirely restored, so that not a hair shall be lost.[fn-22-P2226_1340435:132-nf] Peter's sword He orders back into its sheath, restoring as it was before the ear of His enemy that had been cut off. He says that He could obtain legions of angels to destroy His enemies, but that He must drink the cup which His Father's will had given Him.[fn-22-P2227_1340721:133-nf] He sets the example of drinking this cup, then hands it to His followers, manifesting thus, both in word and deed, the grace of patience. Therefore God raised Him from the dead, and has given Him a name which is above every name; that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and of things in earth, and of things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.[fn-22-P2228_1341226:134-nf] The patriarchs and prophets, then, have a kingdom in this world, to show that these kingdoms, too, are given and taken away by God: the apostles and martyrs had no kingdom here, to show the superior desirableness of the kingdom of heaven. The prophets, however, could even in those times die for the truth, as the Lord Himself says, \"From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharia;[fn-22-P2229_1341632:135-nf] and in these days, since the commencement of the fulfillment of what is prophesied in the psalm of Christ, under the figure of Solomon, which means the peacemaker, as Christ is our peace,[fn-22-P2230_1341844:136-nf] \"All kings of the earth shall bow to Him, all nations shall serve Him,\"[fn-22-P2231_1341936:137-nf] we have seen Christian emperors, who have put all their confidence in Christ, gaining splendid victories over ungodly enemies, whose hope was in the rites of idolatry and devil-worship.

If we look at the things by the names of which the Son of God is called, we shall understand how many good things Jesus is, whom those preach whose feet are beautiful. One good thing is life; but Jesus is the life. Another good thing is the light of the world, when it is true light, and the light of men; and all these things the Son of God is said to be. And another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition to life or light is the truth. And a fourth in addition to time is the way which leads to the truth. And all these things our Saviour teaches that He is, when He says:[fn-61-P6173_952885:47-nf] \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and to rise again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the resurrection, as He says:[fn-61-P6174_953098:48-nf] \"I am the resurrection.\" But the door also is a good, through which one enters into the highest blessedness. Now Christ says:[fn-61-P6175_953241:49-nf] \"I am the door.\" And what need is there to speak of wisdom, which \"the Lord created[fn-61-P6176_953341:50-nf] the first principle of His ways, for His works,\" in whom the father of her rejoiced. delighting in her manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of the mind alone, and provoking him to love who discerns her divine and heavenly charm? A good indeed is the wisdom of God, proclaimed along with the other good foresaid by those whose feet are beautiful. And the power of God is the eighth good we enumerate, which is Christ. Nor must we omit to mention the Word, who is God after the Father of all. For this also is a good, less than no other. Happy, then, are those who accept these goods and receive them from those who announce the good tidings of them, those whose feet are beautiful. Indeed even one of the Corinthians to whom Paul declared that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, should he learn Him who for our sakes became man, and so receive Him, he would become identified with the beginning of the good things we have spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a man of God, and by His death he would die to sin. For \"Christ,[fn-61-P6177_954418:51-nf] in that He died, died unto sin once.\" But from His life, since \"in that He liveth, He liveth unto God,\" every one who is conformed to His resurrection receives that living to God. But who will deny that righteousness, essential righteousness, is a good, and essential sanctification, and essential redemption? And these things those preach who preach Jesus, saying[fn-61-P6178_954801:52-nf] that He is made to be of God righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Hence we shall have writings about Him without number, showing that Jesus is a multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which actually exist in Him in whom[fn-61-P6179_955156:53-nf] \"it pleased God that the whole fulness of the Godhead should dwell bodily.\" and which are not contained in writings. Why should I say, \"are not contained in writings\"? For John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and says:[fn-61-P6180_955412:54-nf] \"I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books which would be written.\" Now to say that the Apostles preach the Saviour is to say that they preach these good things. For this is He who received from the good Father that He Himself should be these good things, so that each man receiving from Jesus the thing or things he is capable of receiving may enjoy good things. But the Apostles, whose feet were beautiful, and those imitators of them who sought to preach the good tidings, could not have done so had not Jesus Himself first preached the good tidings to them, as Isaiah says:[fn-61-P6181_956032:55-nf] \"I myself that speak am here, as the opportunity on the mountains, as the feet of one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching good things; for I will make My salvation to be heard, saying, God shall reign over thee, O Zion!\" For what are the mountains on which the speaker declares that He Himself is present, but those who are less than none of the highest and the greatest of the earth? And these must be sought by the able ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may observe the injunction which says:[fn-61-P6182_956570:56-nf] Go up into a high mountain, thou that preachest good tidings to Zion; thou that preachest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength!\" Now it is not wonderful if to those who are to preach good tidings Jesus Himself preaches good tidings of good things, which are no other than Himself; for the Son of God preaches the good tidings of Himself to those who cannot come to know Him through others. And He who goes up into the mountains and preaches good things to them, being Himself instructed by His good Father,[fn-61-P6183_957116:57-nf] who \"makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust,\" He does not despise those who are poor in soul. To them He preaches good tidings, as He Himself bears witness to us when He takes Isaiah[fn-61-P6184_957374:58-nf] and reads: \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor, He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind.

And when the eyes of all were fastened upon Him, He said, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.\"","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"ANF-10","text":"He said, then, that He was the light of the world; and we have to examine, along with this title, those which are parallel to it; and, indeed, are thought by some to be not merely parallel, but identical with it. He is the true light, and the light of the Gentiles. In the opening of the Gospel now before us He is the light of men: \"That which was made,\"[fn-62-P6285_992535:120-nf] it says, \"was life in Him, and the life was the light of men; and the light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.\" A little further on, in the same passage, He is called the true light:[fn-62-P6286_992761:121-nf] \"The true light, which lightens every man, was coming into the world.\" In Isaiah, He is the light of the Gentiles, as we said before. \"Behold,[fn-62-P6287_992922:122-nf] I have set Thee for a light of the Gentiles, that Thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" Now the sensible light of the world is the sun, and after it comes very worthily the moon, and the same title may be applied to the stars; but those lights of the world are said in Moses to have come into existence on the fourth day, and as they shed light on the things on the earth, they are not the true light. But the Saviour shines on creatures which have intellect and sovereign reason, that their minds may behold their proper objects of vision, and so he is the light of the intellectual world, that is to say, of the reasonable souls which are in the sensible world, and if there be any beings beyond these in the world from which He declares Himself to be our Saviour. He is, indeed, the most determining and distinguished part of that world, and, as we may say, the sun who makes the great day of the Lord. In view of this day He says to those who partake of His light, \"Work[fn-62-P6288_993938:123-nf] while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\" Then He says to His disciples,[fn-62-P6289_994107:124-nf] \"Ye are the light of the world,\" and \"Let your light shine before men.\" Thus we see the Church, the bride, to present an analogy to the moon and stars, and the disciples have a light, which is their own or borrowed from the true sun, so that they are able to illuminate those who have no command of any spring of light in themselves. We may say that Paul and Peter are the light of the world, and that those of their disciples who are enlightened themselves, but are not able to enlighten others, are the world of which the Apostles were the light. But the Saviour, being the light of the world, illuminates not bodies, but by His incorporeal power the incorporeal intellect, to the end that each of us, enlightened as by the sun, may be able to discern the rest of the things of the mind. And as when the sun is shining the moon and the stars lose their power of giving light, so those who are irradiated by Christ and receive His beams have no need of the ministering apostles and prophets-we must have courage to declare this truth-nor of the angels; I will add that they have no need even of the greater powers when they are disciples of that first-born light. To those who do not receive the solar beams of Christ. the ministering saints do afford an illumination much less than the former; this illumination is as much as those persons can receive, and it completely fills them. Christ, again, the light of the world, is the true light as distinguished from the light of sense; nothing that is sensible is true. Yet though the sensible is other than the true, it does not follow that the sensible is false, for the sensible may have an analogy with the intellectual, and not everything that is not true can correctly be called false. Now I ask whether the light of the world is the same thing with the light of men, and I conceive that a higher power of light is intended by the former phrase than by the latter, for the world in one sense is not only men. Paul shows that the world is something more than men when he writes to the Corinthians in his first Epistle:[fn-62-P6290_996203:125-nf] \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" In one sense, too, it may be considered,[fn-62-P6291_996334:126-nf] the world is the creation which is being delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God, whose earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. We also draw attention to the comparison which may be drawn between the statement, \"I am the light of the world,\" and the words addressed to the disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Some suppose that the genuine disciples of Jesus are greater than other creatures, some seeking the reason of this ill the natural growth of these disciples, others inferring it from their harder struggle. For those beings which are in flesh and blood have greater labours and a life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body, and the lights of heaven might not, if they had put on bodies of earth, have accomplished this life of ours free from danger and from error. Those who incline to this argument may appeal to those texts of Scripture which say the most exalted things about men, and to the fact that the Gospel is addressed directly to men; not so much is said about the creation, or, as we understand it, about the world. We read,[fn-62-P6292_997524:127-nf] \"As I and Thou are one, that they also may be one in Us,\" and[fn-62-P6293_997608:128-nf] \"Where I am, there will also My servant be.\" These sayings, plainly, are about men; while about the creation it is said that it is delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. It might be added that not even when it is delivered will it take part in the glory of the sons of God. Nor will those who hold this view forget that the first-born of every creature, honouring man above all else, became man, and that it was not any of the constellations existing in the sky, but one of another order, appointed for this purpose and in the service of the knowledge of Jesus, that was made to be the Star of the East, whether it was like the other stars or perchance better than they, to be the sign of Him who is the most excellent of all. And if the boasting of the saints is in their tribulations, since[fn-62-P6294_998478:129-nf] \"tribulation worketh patience, and patience probation, and probation hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,\" then the afflicted creation cannot have the like patience with man, nor the like probation, nor the like hope, but another degree of these, since[fn-62-P6295_998749:130-nf] \"the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it. for hope.\" Now he who shrinks from conferring such great attributes on man will turn to another direction and say that the creature being subjected to vanity groans and suffers greater affliction than those who groan in this tabernacle, for has she not suffered for the utmost extent of time in her service of vanity-nay, many times as long as man? For why does she do this not willingly, but that it is against her nature to be subject to vanity, and not to have the best arrangement of her life, that which she shall receive when she is set free, when the world is destroyed and released even from the vanity of bodies. Here, however, we may appear to be stretching too far, and aiming at more than the question now before us requires. We may return, therefore, to the point from which we set out, and ask for what reason the Saviour is called the light of the world, the true light, and the light of men. Now we saw that He is called the true light with reference to the sensible light of the world, and that the light of the world is the same thing as the light of men, or that we may at least enquire whether they are the same. This discussion is not superfluous. Some students do not take anything at all out of the statement that the Saviour is the Word; and it is important for us to assure ourselves that we are not chargeable with caprice in fixing our attention on that notion. If it admits of being taken in a metaphorical sense we ought not to take it literally.[fn-62-P6296_1000345:131-nf] When we apply the mystical and allegorical method to the expression \"light of the world\" and the many analogous terms mentioned above, we should surely do so with this expression also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-06","text":"XIII.

It remains then that we understand as concerning those women, whether in Egypt or in Jericho, that for their humanity and mercy they received a reward, in any wise temporal, which indeed itself, while they wist not of it, should by prophetical signification prefigure somewhat eternal. But whether it be ever right, even for the saving of a man's life, to tell a lie, as it is a question in resolving which even the most learned do weary themselves, it did vastly surpass the capacity of those poor women, set in the midst of those nations, and accustomed to those manners. Therefore their ignorance in this as well as in those other things of which they were alike unknowing, but which are to be known by the children not of this world but of that which is to come, the patience of God did bear withal: Who yet, for their human kindness which they had shown to His servants, rendered unto them rewards of an earthly sort, albeit signifying somewhat of an heavenly. And Rahab, indeed, delivered out of Jericho, made transition into the people of God, where, being proficient, she might attain to eternal and immortal prizes which are not to be sought by any lie. Yet at that time when she did for the Israelite spies that good, and, for her condition of life, laudable work, she was not as yet such that it should be required of her, \"In your mouth let Yea be yea, Nay nay.\"[fn-44-P4482_2194768:66-nf] But as for those midwives, albeit Hebrewesses, if they savored only after the flesh, what or how great is the good they got of their temporal reward in that they made them houses, unless by making proficiency they attained unto that house of which is sung unto God, \"Blessed are they that dwell in thine house; for ever and ever they will praise thee?\"[fn-44-P4483_2195139:67-nf] It must be confessed, however, that it approacheth much unto righteousness, and though not yet in reality, even now in respect of hopefulness and disposition that mind is to be praised, which never lies except with intention and will to do good to some man, but to hurt no man.

For it was a great gift to the Patriarchs that God in place of His own name should add their name to His own designation as God, as Paul says,[fn-65-P6503_1100686:48-nf] \"Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God.\" He is the God, therefore, of the fathers and of all the saints; it might be hard to find a passage to the effect that God is the God of any of the wicked. If, then, He is the God of the saints, and is said to be the God of the living, then the saints are the living and the living are saints; neither is there any saint outside the living, nor when any one is called living is the further implication absent that in addition to his having life he is a holy one. Near akin to this is the lesson to be drawn from the saying,[fn-65-P6504_1101282:49-nf] \"I shall be well pleasing to the Lord in the land of the living.\" The good pleasure of tile Lord, he appears to say, is in the ranks of the saints, or in the place of the saints, and it is there that he hopes to be. No one pleases God well who has not entered the rank of the saints, or the place of the saints; and to that place every one must come who has assumed beforehand, as it were in this life, the shadow and image of true God-pleasing. The passage which declares that before God no living being shall be justified shows that in comparison with God and the righteousness that is in Him none, even of the most finished saints, will be justified. We might take a parable from another quarter and say that no candle can give light before the sun, not that the candle will not give light, only it will not when the sun out-shines it. In the same way every \"living\" will be justified, only not before God, when it is compared with those who are below and who are in the power of darkness. To them the light of the saints will shine. Here, perhaps, we have the key to the meaning of that verse:[fn-65-P6505_1102398:50-nf] \"Let your light shine before men.\" He does not say, Let your light shine before God; had he said so he would have given a commandment impossible of fulfilment, as if he had bidden those lights which have souls to let their light shine before the sun. It is not only, therefore, the ordinary mass of the living who will not be justified before God, but even those among the living who are distinguished above the rest, or, to put it more truly, the whole righteousness of the living will not be justified before God, as compared with the righteousness of God, as if I were to call together all the lights which shine on the earth by night, and to say that they could not give light in comparison with the rays of the sun. We rise from these considerations to a higher level when we take the words before our minds, \"I live, saith the Lord.\" Life, in the full sense of the word, especially after what we have been saying on the subject, belongs perhaps to God and none but Him. Is this the reason why the Apostle, after speaking of the supreme excellency of the life of God and being led to the highest expression about it, says about God (showing in this a true understanding of that saying, \"I live, saith the Lord\"); \"who only hath immortality.\"[fn-65-P6506_1103663:51-nf] No living being besides God has life free from change and variation.

And from these words it can be understood without doubt by all that peace is given by the Lord, not to men of evil will, but to men of good will. Whence the Lord, speaking by the prophet, says: \"How good is God to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart! But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh slipped: for I was envious at the unrighteous, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.\"[fn-91-P9120_2953753:2-nf] Of the good, however, the Truth says in His own person, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-91-P9121_2953886:3-nf] And they are not the pure in heart who think evil things, or things hurtful to their brethren; for he who is the faithful man devises nothing evil. The faithful man, accordingly, loves rather to hear things which are becoming, than to speak things which are not becoming. And if any one is faithful, let him see to it that he speak no evil, and lay no snares in the way of any one. In this, then, are the children of God distinguished from the children of the devil. For the children of God always think and strive to do things which are of God, and give help unceasingly to their brethren, and wish to injure no one. But, on the other hand, the children of the devil are always meditating things evil and hurtful, because their deeds are evil. And of them the Lord, speaking by the prophet Jeremiah, says: \"I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness.\"[fn-91-P9122_2954780:4-nf] \"Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord; and with your children's children will I plead.\"[fn-91-P9123_2954898:5-nf] \"Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you.\"[fn-91-P9124_2954982:6-nf] These things, brethren, are greatly to be feared, and to be guarded against by all; for the man on whom the judgment of God may fall will not depart unhurt. And therefore let every one see to it carefully that he neither contrive nor do against a brother what he would not wish to have to endure himself. And let not the man of faith come under the suspicion even of saying or doing what he would not wish to have to endure himself. Wherefore persons suspected, or hostile or litigious, and those who are not of good conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, and those who do not hold and teach the right faith, have been debarred from being either accusers or witnesses by our predecessors with apostolic authority; and we too remove them from that function, and exclude them from it in times to come, lest those lapse wilfully whom we ought to keep in and save; lest not only (which may God forbid!) the predicted judgment of God should fall upon both, but we also should perish (which may God forbid!) through their fault. For it is written, \"Have they made thee the master of a feast? Take care for them, that thou mayst be merry on their account, and receive as thy crown the ornament of esteem, and find approbation of thine election.\"[fn-91-P9125_2956248:7-nf] For the evil word affects the heart, out of which proceed these four objects, good and evil, life and death; and the tongue in its assiduous action is what determines these. Wherefore the before-named parties are altogether to be avoided; and until the before-noted matters are investigated, and the parties are found to be clear of such, they are not to be received: for the right sacrifice is to give heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity. \"To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord, and to forsake unrighteousness is a sacrifice of praise.\"[fn-91-P9126_2956851:8-nf] For it is written, \"Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him. But if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. For as a man who destroyeth his friend, so is he who destroys (loseth) the friendship of his neighbour. And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so art thou that has let thy neighbour go and shalt not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he has escaped like a roe out of the snare, because his soul is wounded. Thou wilt not be able to bind him any more, and there is reconciliation for the reviled. But to betray the secrets of a friend is the desperation of a wretched soul. He that winketh with the eye worketh evil, and no one will cast him off. When thou art present, he will despise his own mouth, and express his wonder at thy discourse; but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him; and the Lord will hate him. Whoso casteth a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head, and a deceitful stroke of the deceitful will make wounds. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that setteth a stone in his neighbour's way will all thereon; and he that placeth a snare for another will perish therein. He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh on him. Mockery and reproach are from the proud; and vengeance, as a lion, shall be in wait for them.

He showeth no mercy to a man which is like himself; and doth he ask forgiveness of the Most High for his own sins? He, though he is flesh, nourisheth hatred; and doth he ask pardon of God? Who will entreat for his sins? Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; for corruption and death impend on commandments. Remember the fear of God, and bear no malice to thy neighbour.

But although patience be a virtue of the mind, yet partly the mind exercises it in the mind itself, partly in the body. In itself it exercises patience, when, the body remaining unhurt and untouched, the mind is goaded by any adversities or filthinesses of things or words, to do or to say something that is not expedient or not becoming, and patiently bears all evils that it may not itself commit any evil in work or word. By this patience we bear, even while we be sound in body, that in the midst of the offenses of this world our blessedness is deferred: of which is said what I cited a little before, \"If what we see not we hope for, we do by patience wait for it.\" By this patience, holy David bore the revilings of a railer,[fn-47-P4744_2339839:12-nf] and, when he might easily have avenged himself, not only did it not, but even refrained another who was vexed and moved for him; and more put forth his kingly power by prohibiting than by exercising vengeance. Nor at that time was his body afflicted with any disease or wound, but there was an acknowledging of a time of humility, and a bearing of the will of God, for the sake of which there was a drinking of the bitterness of contumely with most patient mind. This patience the Lord taught, when, the servants being moved at the mixing in of the tares and wishing to gather them up, He said that the householder answered, \"Leave both to grow until the harvest.\"[fn-47-P4745_2340527:13-nf] That, namely, must be patience put up with, which must not be in haste put away. Of this patience Himself afforded and showed an example, when, before the passion of His Body, He so bore with His disciple Judas, that ere He pointed him out as the traitor, He endured him as a thief;[fn-47-P4746_2340831:14-nf] and before experience of bonds and cross and death, did, to those lips so full of guile, not deny the kiss of peace.[fn-47-P4747_2340975:15-nf] All these, and whatever else there be, which it were tedious to rehearse, belong to that manner of patience, by which the mind doth, not its own sins but any evils so ever from without, patiently endure in itself, while the body remains altogether unhurt. But the other manner of patience is that by which the same mind bears any troubles and grievances whatsoever in the sufferings of the body; not as do foolish or wicked men for the sake of getting vain things or perpetrating crimes; but as is defined by the Lord, \"for righteousness' sake.\"[fn-47-P4748_2341542:16-nf] In both kinds, the holy Martyrs contended. For both with scornful reproofs of the ungodly were they filled, where, the body remaining intact, the mind hath its own (as it were) blows and wounds, and bears these unbroken: and in their bodies they were bound, imprisoned, vexed with hunger and thirst, tortured, gashed, torn asunder, burned, butchered; and with piety immovable submitted unto God their mind, while they were suffering in the flesh all that exquisite cruelty could devise in its mind.","title":"On Patience","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Come now, let our opponents sever the connection of the flesh with the soul in the affairs of life, that they may be emboldened to sunder it also in the recompense of life. Let them deny their association in acts, that they may be fairly able to deny also their participation in rewards. The flesh ought not to have any share in the sentence, if it had none in the cause of it. Let the soul alone be called back, if it alone went away. But (nothing of the kind ever happened); for the soul alone no more departed from life, than it ran through alone the course from which it departed-I mean this present life. Indeed, the soul alone is so far from conducting (the affairs of) life, that we do not withdraw from community with the flesh even our thoughts, however isolated they be, however unprecipitated into act by means of the flesh; since whatever is done in man's heart is done by the soul in the flesh, and with the flesh, and through the flesh. The Lord Himself, in short, when rebuking our thoughts, includes in His censures this aspect of the flesh, (man's heart), the citadel of the soul: \"Why think ye evil in your hearts? \"[fn-98-P9812_2702233:88-nf] and again: \"Whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\"[fn-98-P9813_2702368:89-nf] So that even the thought, without operation and without effect, is an act of the flesh. But if you allow that the faculty which rules the senses, and which they call <i>hegemonikon,[fn-98-P9814_2702568:90-nf] has its sanctuary in the brain, or in the interval between the eyebrows, or wheresoever the philosophers are pleased to locate it, the flesh will still be the thinking place of the soul. The soul is never without the flesh, as long as it is in the flesh. There is nothing which the flesh does not transact in company with the soul, when without it does not exist. Consider carefully, too, whether the thoughts are not administered by the flesh, since it is through the flesh that they are distinguished and known externally. Let the soul only meditate some design, the face gives the indication-the face being the mirror of all our intentions. They may deny all combination in acts, but they cannot gainsay their co-operation in thoughts. Still they enumerate the sins of the flesh; surely, then, for its sinful conduct it must be consigned to punishment. But we, moreover, allege against them the virtues of the flesh; surely also for its virtuous conduct it deserves a future reward. Again, as it is the soul which acts and impels us in all we do, so it is the function of the flesh to render obedience. Now we are not permitted to suppose that God is either unjust or idle. Unjust, (however He would be, ) were He to exclude from reward the flesh which is associated in good works; and idle, were He to exempt it from punishment, when it has been an accomplice in evil deeds: whereas human judgment is deemed to be the more perfect, when it discovers the agents in every deed, and neither spares the guilty nor grudges the virtuous their full share of either punishment or praise with the principals who employed their services.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"ANF-03","text":"To a preceding objection, that the Scriptures are allegorical, I have still one answer to make-that it is open to us also to defend the bodily character of the resurrection by means of the language of the prophets, which is equally figurative.

For if the earth has to suffer either joy or injury, it is simply on man's account, that he may suffer the joy or the sorrow through the events which happen to his dwelling-place, whereby he will rather have to pay the penalty which, simply on his account, even the earth must suffer. When, therefore, God even threatens the earth, I would prefer saying that He threatens the flesh: so likewise, when He makes a promise to the earth, I would rather understand Him as promising the flesh; as in that passage of David: \"The Lord is King, let the earth be glad,\"[fn-99-P9938_2746965:181-nf] -meaning the flesh of the saints, to which appertains the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. Then he afterwards says: \"The earth saw and trembled; the mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord,\"-meaning, no doubt the flesh of the wicked; and (in a similar sense) it is written: \"For they shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-99-P9939_2747322:182-nf] If indeed it will be thought that both these passages were pronounced simply of the element earth, how can it be consistent that it should shake and melt at the presence of the Lord, at whose royal dignity it before exulted? So again in Isaiah, \"Ye shall eat the good of the land,\"[fn-99-P9940_2747626:183-nf] the expression means the blessings which await the flesh when in the kingdom of God it shall be renewed, and made like the angels, and waiting to obtain the things \"which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, and which have not entered into the heart of man.\"[fn-99-P9941_2747905:184-nf] Otherwise, how vain that God should invite men to obedience by the fruits of the field and the elements of this life, when He dispenses these to even irreligious men and blasphemers; on a general condition once for all made to man, \"sending rain on the good and on the evil, and making His sun to shine on the just and on the unjust!\"[fn-99-P9942_2748261:185-nf] Happy, no doubt, is faith, if it is to obtain gifts which the enemies of God and Christ not only use, but even abuse, \"worshipping the creature itself in opposition to the Creator!\"[fn-99-P9943_2748463:186-nf] You will reckon, (I suppose) onions and truffles among earth's bounties, since the Lord declares that \"man shall not live on bread alone!\"[fn-99-P9944_2748621:187-nf] In this way the Jews lose heavenly blessings, by confining their hopes to earthly ones, being ignorant of the promise of heavenly bread, and of the oil of God's unction, and the wine of the Spirit, and of that water of life which has its vigour from the vine of Christ. On exactly the same principle, they consider the special soil of Judµa to be that very holy land, which ought rather to be interpreted of the Lord's flesh, which, in all those who put on Christ, is thenceforward the holy land; holy indeed by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, truly flowing with milk and honey by the sweetness of His assurance, truly Judµan by reason of the friendship of God. For \"he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, but he who is one inwardly.\"[fn-99-P9945_2749379:188-nf] In the same way it is that both God's temple and Jerusalem (must be understood) when it is said by Isaiah: \"Awake, awake, O Jerusalem! put on the strength of thine arm; awake, as in thine earliest time,\"[fn-99-P9946_2749607:189-nf] that is to say, in that innocence which preceded the fall into sin. For how can words of this kind of exhortation andinvitation be suitable for that Jerusalem which killed the prophets, and stoned those that were sent to them, and at last crucified its very Lord? Neither indeed is salvation promised to any one land at all, which must needs pass away with the fashion of the whole world. Even if anybody should venture strongly to contend that paradise is the holy land, which it may be possible to designate as the land of our first parents Adam and Eve, it will even then follow that the restoration of paradise will seem to be promised to the flesh, whose lot it was to inhabit and keep it, in order that man may be recalled thereto just such as he was driven from it.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":43,"source_paragraph":"149","folder":"ANF-03","text":"It is still the same sentiment which he follows up in the passage in which he puts the recompense above the sufferings: \"for we know; \"he says, \"that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; \"[fn-100-P10071_2802830:269-nf] in other words, owing to the fact that our flesh is undergoing dissolution through its sufferings, we shall be provided with a home in heaven.

For we must say to him, When is He not present, and when is He not in the world? Does not this Gospel say, \"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.\" And this is why those to whom the Logos is He \"whom you know not,\" do not know Him: they have never gone out of the world, but the world does not know Him. But at what time did He cease to be among men? Was He not in Isaiah, when He said,[fn-68-P6869_1276941:110-nf] \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me,\" and[fn-68-P6870_1277031:111-nf] \"I became manifest to those who sought me not.\" Let them say, too, if He was not in David when he said, not from himself,[fn-68-P6871_1277173:112-nf] \"But I was established by Him a king in Zion His holy hill,\" and the other words spoken in the Psalms in the person of Christ. And why should I go over the details of this proof, truly they are hard to be numbered, when I can show quite clearly that He was always in men? And that is enough to show Heracleon's interpretation of \"There standeth in the midst of you,\" to be unsound, when he says it is equivalent to \"He is already here, and He is in the world and in men.\" We are disposed to agree with him when he says that the words, \"Who cometh after me,\" show John to be the forerunner of Christ, for he is in fact a kind of servant running before his master. The words, however, \"Whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose,\" receive much too simple an interpretation when it is said that \"in these words the Baptist confesses that he is not worthy even of the least honourable ministration to Christ.\" After this interpretation he adds, not without sense, \"I am not worthy that for my sake He should come down from His greatness and should take flesh as His footgear, concerning which I am not able to give any explanation or description, nor to unloose the arrangement of it.\" In understanding the world by his shoe, Heracleon shows some largeness of mind, but immediately after he verges on impiety in declaring that all this is to be understood of that person whom John here has in his mind. For he considers that it is the demiurge of the world who confesses by these words that he is a lesser person than the Christ; and this is the height of impiety. For the Father who sent Him, He who is the God of the living as Jesus Himself testifies, of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, and He who is greater than heaven and earth for the reason that He is the Maker of them, He also alone is good and is greater than He who was sent by Him. And even if, as we said, Heracleon's idea was a lofty one, that the whole world was the shoe of Jesus, yet I think we ought not to agree with him. For how can it be harmonized with such a view, that \"Heaven is My throne and the earth My footstool,\" a testimony which Jesus accepts as said of the Father?[fn-68-P6872_1279342:113-nf] \"Swear not by heaven,\" He says, \"for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet.\" How, if he takes the whole world to be the shoe of Jesus, can he also accept the text,[fn-68-P6873_1279566:114-nf] \"Do not I fill heaven and earth? \"saith the Lord. It is also worth while to enquire, whether as the Word and wisdom permeated the whole world, and as the Father was in the Son, the words are to be understood as above or in this way, that He who first of all was girded about with the whole creation, in addition to the Son's being in Him, granted to the Saviour, as being second after Him and being God the Word, to pervade the whole creation. To those who have it in them to take note of the uninterrupted movement of the great heaven, how it carries with it from East to West so great a multitude of stars, to them most of all it will seem needful to enquire what that force is, how great and of what nature, which is present in the whole world.

This statement is taken in a wrong sense by every uneducated as well as every perversely disposed person, as if it predicated a diversity, in such a sense as to imply a separation among the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit. I am, moreover, obliged to say this, when (extolling the Monarchy at the expense of the Economy) they contend for the identity of the Father and Son and Spirit, that it is not by way of diversity that the Son differs from the Father, but by distribution: it is not by division that He is different, but by distinction; because the Father is not the same as the Son, since they differ one from the other in the mode of their being.[fn-105-P10500_2942224:96-nf] For the Father is the entire substance, but the Son is a derivation and portion of the whole,[fn-105-P10501_2942423:97-nf] as He Himself acknowledges: \"My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-105-P10502_2943264:98-nf] In the Psalm His inferiority is described as being \"a little lower than the angels.\"[fn-105-P10503_2943368:99-nf] Thus the Father is distinct from the Son, being greater than the Son, inasmuch as He who begets is one, and He who is begotten is another; He, too, who sends is one, and He who is sent is another; and He, again, who makes is one, and He through whom the thing is made is another. Happily the Lord Himself employs this expression of the person of the Paraclete, so as to signify not a division or severance, but a disposition (of mutual relations in the Godhead); for He says, \"I will pray the Father, and He shall send you another Comforter ... even the Spirit of truth,\"[fn-105-P10504_2943956:100-nf] thus making the Paraclete distinct from Himself, even as we say that the Son is also distinct from the Father; so that He showed a third degree in the Paraclete, as we believe the second degree is in the Son, by reason of the order observed in the Economy.

It was not, then, in vain that Christ died, in order that the law might be fulfilled through Him who said, \"I am come not to destroy the law, but tofulfil it;\"[fn-60-P6099_2366565:142-nf] and that our nature, which was lost through Adam, might through Him be recovered, who said that \"He was come to seek and to save that which was lost;\"[fn-61-P6100_2366736:143-nf] in whose coming the old fathers likewise who loved God believed.","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_25_sermon_viii_lviii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"7.

It was not, then, without a purpose that these fishes were described as so many in number, and so large in size, that is, as both an hundred and fifty-three, and large. For so it is written, \"And He drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty andthree.\" For when the Lord said, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill \"because about to give the Spirit, through whom the law might be fulfilled, and to add thereby, as it were, seven to ten; after interposing a few other words He proceeded, \"Whosoevertherefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shallbe called the least in the kingdom of heaven: ] but whosoever shall do and teach them. thesame shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. The latter, therefore, may possibly belong to the number of great fishes. But he that is the least, who undoes in deed what he teaches in word, may be in such a church as is signified by that first capture of fishes, which contains both good and bad, for it also is called the kingdom of heaven, as He says, \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of ever kind;\"[fn-38-P3864_2127258:20-nf] where He wishes the good as well as the bad to be understood, and of whom He declares that they are yet to be separated on the shore, to wit, at the end of the world. And lastly, to show that those least ones are reprobates who teach by word of mouth the good which they undo by their evil lives, and that they will not be even the least, as it were, in the life that is eternal, but will have no place there at all; after saying, \"He shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven,\" He immediately added, \"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-38-P3865_2127952:21-nf] Such, doubtless-these scribes and Pharisees-are those who sit in Moses' seat, and of whom He says, \"Do ye what they gay, but do not what they do; for they say, and do not.\"[fn-38-P3866_2128146:22-nf] They teach in sermons what they undo by their morals. It therefore follows that he who is least in the kingdom of heaven, as the Church now exists, shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, as the Church shall be hereafter; for by teaching what he himself is in the habit of breaking, he can have no place in the company of those who do what they teach, and therefore will not be in the number of great fishes, seeing it is he \"who shall do and teach that shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" And because he will be great here, therefore shall he be there, where he that is least shall not be. Yea, so great will they certainly be there, that he who is less there is greater than the greatest here.[fn-38-P3867_2128883:23-nf] And yet those who are great here, that is, who do the good that they teach in that kingdom of heaven into which the net gathereth good and bad, shall be greater still in that eternal state of the heavenly kingdom,-those, I mean, who are indicated by the fishes here as belonging to the right hand and to the resurrection of life.

Evidently, in the case of Christ both the divine nature and the will and the sect are different from any previously known! He will have commanded either no martyrdoms at all, or those which must be understood in a sense different from the ordinary, being such a person as to urge no one to a risk of this kind as to promise no reward to them who suffer for Him, because He does not wish them to suffer; and therefore does He say, when setting forth His chief commands, \"Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-110-P11043_3120954:57-nf] The following statement, indeed, applies first to all without restriction, then specially to the apostles themselves: \"Blessed shall ye be when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, for my sake.

Though, even if He had appointed all this persecution in case He were obeyed for those only who were then apostles, assuredly through them along with the entire sacrament, with the shoot of the name, with the layer of the Holy Spirit, the rule about enduring persecution also would have had respect to us too, as to disciples by inheritance, and, (as it were, )bushes from the apostolic seed. For even thus again does He address words of guidance to the apostles: \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; \"and, \"Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles,\" etc.[fn-110-P11044_3122219:58-nf] Now when He adds, \"But the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death,\" He has dearly announced with reference to the others, (that they would be subjected to) this form of unrighteous conduct, which we do not find exemplified in the case of the apostles. For none of them had experience of a father or a brother as a betrayer, which very many of us have. Then He returns to the apostles: \"And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.\" How much more shall we, for whom there exists the necessity of being delivered up by parents too! Thus, by allotting this very betrayal, now to the apostles, now to all, He pours out the same destruction upon all the possessors of the name, on whom the name. along with the condition that it be an object of hatred, will rest. But he who will endure on to the end-this man will be saved. By enduring what but persecution,-betrayal,-death? For to endure to the end is nought else than to suffer the end. And therefore there immediately follow, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his own lord; \"because, seeing the Master and Lord Himself was stedfast in suffering persecution, betrayal and death, much more will it be the duty of His servants and disciples to bear the same, that they may not seem as if superior to Him, or to have got an immunity from the assaults of unrighteousness, since this itself should be glory enough for them, to be conformed to the sufferings of their Lord and Master; and, preparing them for the endurance of these, He reminds them that they must not fear such persons as kill the body only, but are not able to destroy the soul, but that they must dedicate fear to Him rather who has such power that He can kill both body and soul, and destroy them in hell. Who, pray, are these slayers of the body only, but the governors and kings aforesaid-men, I ween? Who is the ruler of the soul also, but God only? Who is this but the threatener of fires hereafter, He without whose will not even one of two sparrows falls to the ground; that is, not even one of the two substances of man, flesh or spirit, because the number of our hairs also has been recorded before Him? Fear ye not, therefore. When He adds, \"Ye are of more value than many sparrows,\" He makes promise that we shall not in vain-that is, not without profit-fall to the ground if we choose to be killed by men rather than by God. \"Whosoever therefore will confess in me before men, in him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven;[fn-110-P11045_3124856:59-nf] and whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny also before my Father who is in heaven.\" Clear, as I think, are the terms used in announcing, and the way to explain, the confession as well as the denial, although the mode of putting them is different. He who confesses himself a Christian, beareth witness that he is Christ's; he who is Christ's must be in Christ. If he is in Christ, he certainly confesses in Christ, when he confesses himself a Christian. For he cannot be this without being in Christ. Besides, by confessing in Christ he confesses Christ too: since, by virtue of being a Christian, he is in Christ, while Christ Himself also is in him. For if you have made mention of day, you have also held out to view the element of light which gives us day, although you may not have made mention of light. Thus, albeit He has not expressly said, \"He who will confess me,\" (yet) the conduct involved in daily confession Is not different from what is meant in our Lord's declaration. For he who confesses himself to be what he is, that is, a Christian, confesses that likewise by which he is it, that is, Christ. Therefore he who has denied that he is a Christian, has denied in Christ, by denying that he is in Christ while he denies that he is a Christian; and, on the other hand, by denying that Christ is in him, while He denies that he is in Christ, he will deny Christ too. Thus both he who will deny in Christ, will deny Christ, and he who will confess in Christ will confess Christ. It would have been enough, therefore, though our Lord had made an announcement about confessing merely. For, from His mode of presenting confession, it might be decided beforehand with reference to its opposite too-denial, that is-that denial is repaid by the Lord with denial, just as confession is with confession. And therefore, since in the mould in which the confession has been cast the state of (the case with reference to) denial also may be perceived, it is evident that to another manner of denial belongs what the Lord has announced concerning it, in terms different from those in which He speaks of confession, when He says, \"Who will deny me,\" not \"Who will deny in me.\" For He had foreseen that this form of violence also would, for the most part, immediately follow when any one had been forced to renounce the Christian name,-that he who had denied that he was a Christian would be compelled to deny Christ Himself too by blaspheming Him. As not long ago, alas, we shuddered at the struggle waged in this way by some with their entire faith, which had had favourable omens.

But there is more, because He threatens likewise shame with shame (in return): \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me before men, of him will I also be ashamed before my Father who is in heaven.\" For He was aware that denial is produced even most of all by shame, that the state of the mind appears in the forehead, and that the wound of shame precedes that in the body.","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-03","text":"It remains for us, lest ancient times may perhaps have had the sacrament[fn-110-P11042_3120087:56-nf] (exclusively) their own, to review the modern Christian system, as though, being also from God, it might be different from what preceded, and besides, therefore, opposed thereto in its code of rules likewise, so that its Wisdom knows not to murder her own sons!

So also it is said to hear with the ears when it perceives the deeper meaning of a statement. So also we say that it makes use of teeth, when it chews and eats the bread of life which cometh down from heaven.

Wherefore to those whom He is about to condemn, yea, rather to those whom He is about to crown, He will impute alms only, as though He would say, \"It were a hard matter for me not to find occasion to condemn you, were I to examine and weigh you accurately and with much exactness to scrutinize your deeds; but, \"Go into the kingdom, for I was hungry, and ye gave Me meat.\" Ye shall therefore go into the kingdom, not because ye have not sinned, but because ye have redeemed your sins by alms. And again to the others, \"Go ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.\" They too, guilty as they are, old in their sins, late in their fear for them, in what respect, when they turn their sins over in their mind, could they dare to say that they are undeservedly condemned, that this sentence is pronounced against them undeservedly by so righteous a Judge?

Although the whole world is arranged into offices of different kinds, its condition, nevertheless, is not to be supposed as one of internal discrepancies and discordances; but as our one body is provided with many members, and is held together by one soul, so I am of opinion that the whole world also ought to be regarded as some huge and immense animal, which is kept together by the power and reason of God as by one soul. This also, I think, is indicated in sacred Scripture by the declaration of the prophet, \"Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord; \"[fn-64-P6476_1244459:5-nf] and again, \"The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; \"[fn-64-P6477_1244548:6-nf] and by the Saviour's words, when He says that we are to swear \"neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool: \"[fn-64-P6478_1244716:7-nf] To the same effect also are the words of Paul, in his address to the Athenians, when he says, \"In Him we live, and move, and have our being.\"[fn-64-P6479_1244874:8-nf] For how do we live, and move, and have our being in God, except by His comprehending and holding together the whole world by His power?

And that God, the Father of all things, fills and holds together the world with the fulness of His power, according to those passages which we have quoted, no one, I think, will have any difficulty in admitting.

Moreover, they think that the natives of other countries are to be given them as the ministers of their pleasures, whom they are to employ either as tillers of the field or builders of walls, and by whom their ruined and fallen city is again to be raised up; and they think that they are to receive the wealth of the nations to live on, and that they will have control over their riches; that even the camels of Midian and Kedar will come, and bring to them gold, and incense, and precious stones. And these views they think to establish on the authority of the prophets by those promises which are written regarding Jerusalem; and by those passages also where it is said, that they who serve the Lord shall eat and drink, but that sinners shall hunger and thirst; that the righteous shall be joyful, but that sorrow shall possess the wicked.

And consequently, as His will suffers no change, let no man presume on matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of that word which the apostle speaks: \"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? \"[fn-92-P9240_3009696:13-nf] To this, too, our Lord's word may refer: \"And if any man will take away thy coat, and sue thee at the law, let him have thy cloak also.\"[fn-92-P9241_3009852:14-nf] And in another place: \"Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.\"[fn-92-P9242_3009949:15-nf] Moreover, there are certain things which might be thought most trivial were they not shown in the Scriptures to be of more serious import.

And it is manifest that these are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not lawful for us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all persons who underlie the charge of any manner of turpitude and dishonour, are rendered infamous; and all who arm themselves against fathers are rendered infamous. \"Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious.\"[fn-92-P9246_3011440:19-nf] \"He that wanteth understanding thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and erring man imagineth follies.\"[fn-92-P9247_3011568:20-nf] For their suspicion has overthrown many, and their opinion hath held them in vanity. \"A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein.

For if this were made an easy matter to secular and wicked men, there would remain no one, or but the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has been and still is the case-and (which is yet worse) that too in growing measure-that the wicked persecute the good, and that the carnal are hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has been already said, they decreed that such should not be accused at all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such should be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has been stated above, by what persons that function should not be assumed; and they resolved further, that bishops should not be cast out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way the matter of accusation should be taken in hand before their rightful seat and all their property are restored by those laws, they should by no means be accused or criminated by any one, and should not answer any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of their own accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted, and have had all their effects restored to them by those laws, when their affairs are arranged and set in order, they should then have a long period allowed them for the disposing of their case; and thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come to the suit; and if the matter seem just, they should answer the propositions of their accusers with the help of their brethren. For so long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that any charge ought to be preferred against them. And no one is at liberty by any means to bring any charge against them, whether superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their churches, effects, or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and we too confirm the same statutes and hereby decree, that if any one among the clergy proves an enemy or traducer of his bishops, and seeks to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the consideration of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the clerical order, and given over to the court (curioe), to which he shall devote himself zealously all the days of his life, and shall remain infamous without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume to be at once accuser, and judge, or witness; for in every judicial investigation there must always be four persons present: that is, the judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and the witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority, that the flock should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor, to whose care they had been consigned, unless he falls into error in the faith; for the deeds of superiors are not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth; neither can the disciple be above the master, as the voice of Truth saith, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.\"[fn-92-P9249_3015358:22-nf] ","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_131_the_second_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Accordingly we have set these matters before you, in order that those who now know it not may know this; viz., that the priests, too, whom the Lord has taken to Himself from among all men, and has willed to be His own, are not to be dealt with lightly, nor injured, nor rashly accused or reprehended, save by their masters, seeing that the Lord has chosen to reserve their causes to Himself, and ministers vengeance according to His own judgment.

And likewise he becomes a third peacemaker as he demonstrates that that which appears to others to be a conflict in the Scriptures is no conflict, and exhibits their concord and peace, whether of the Old Scriptures with the New, or of the Law with the Prophets, or of the Gospels with the Apostolic Scriptures, or of the Apostolic Scriptures with each other. For, also, according to the Preacher, all the Scriptures are \"words of the wise like goads, and as nails firmly fixed which were given by agreement from one shepherd; \"[fn-72-P7269_1471215:5-nf] and there is nothing superfluous in them. But l the Word is the one Shepherd of things rational which may have an appearance of discord to those who have not ears to hear, but are truly at perfect concord. For as the different chords of the psalter or the lyre, each of which gives forth a certain sound of its own which seems unlike the sound of another chord, are thought by a man who is not musical and ignorant of the principle of musical harmony, to be inharmonious, because of the dissimilarity of the sounds, so those who are not skilled in hearing the harmony of God in the sacred Scriptures think that the Old is not in harmony with the New, or the Prophets with the Law, or the Gospels with one another, or the Apostle with the Gospel, or with himself, or with the other Apostles. But he who comes instructed in the music of God, being a man wise in word and deed, and, on this account, like another David-which is, by interpretation, skilful with the hand-will bring out the sound of the music of God, having learned from this at the right time to strike the chords, now the chords of the Law, now the Gospel chords in harmony with them, and again the Prophetic chords, and, when reason demands it, the Apostolic chords which are in harmony with the Prophetic, and likewise the Apostolic with those of the Gospels. For he knows that all the Scripture is the one perfect and harmonised[fn-72-P7270_1472628:6-nf] instrument of God, which from different sounds gives forth one saving voice to those willing to learn, which stops and restrains every working of an evil spirit, just as the music of David laid to rest the evil spirit in Saul, which also was choking him.[fn-72-P7271_1472898:7-nf] You see, then, that he is in the third place a peacemaker, who sees in accordance with the Scripture the peace of it all, and implants this peace in those who rightly seek and make nice distinctions in a genuine spirit.

Consider whether the Apostle does not say the same thing when he speaks thus of Christ:[fn-86-P8668_2177702:32-nf] \"Who is the image of the invisible God, the first born of every creature.\" The nature of God is not, as some think, visible to some and not to others, for the Apostle does not say The image of God who is invisible to men, or to sinners; but he speaks quite distinctly of the nature of God in itself, where he says \"The image of the invisible God.\" John also says in his Gospel,[fn-86-P8669_2178097:33-nf] \"No man hath seen God at any time,\" by which he distinctly declares: to all who can understand, that there is no being to whom God is visible; not as if he were naturallyvisible and, like a being of attenuated substance.escaped and eluded our glance; but that, in his own nature it is impossible for him to be seen. But perhaps you will ask me my opinion as to the Only begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even to him the nature of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible, do not dismiss my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for I will at once give you my reason for it. Observe that seeing is a different thing from knowing. Seeing and being seen belong to bodies; to know and to be known belong to the intellectual nature. Whatever then is merely a property of bodies, this we must not attribute to the Father or the Son; but that which belongs to the nature of Deity governs the relations of the Father and the Son. Moreover, Christ himself in the Gospel[fn-86-P8670_2179109:34-nf] did not say \"No man seeth the Son but the Father nor the Father but the Son,\" but \"No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither doth any one know the Father but the Son.\" By this it is clearly shown that what is called seeing and being seen in the case of bodily existence is called knowledge in the case of the Father and the Son: their intercourse is maintained through the power of knowledge not through the weakness of visibility. Since, therefore, an incorporeal nature cannot properly be said to see or to be seen, therefore in the Gospel it is not said either that the Father is seen by the Son or the Son by the Father but that each is known by the other. And if any one should ask how it is that it is said[fn-86-P8671_2179846:35-nf] \"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God,\" I think that this text wilt confirm my assertion still more.

For it is placed in the body, and advances from sensible things themselves, which are corporeal, to things that are intellectual. But lest our statement that things intellectual are not cognisable by the senses should appear unbecoming, we shall employ the instance of Solomon, who says, \"You will find also a divine sense; \"[fn-74-P7417_1711545:69-nf] by which he shows that those things which are intellectual are to be sought out not by means of a bodily sense, but by a certain other which he calls \"divine.\" And with this sense must we look on each of those rational beings which we have enumerated above; and with this sense are to be understood those words which we speak, and those statements to be weighed which we commit to writing.

Faustus said: You quote from the Gospel the words, \"Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-25-P2539_1534218:1-nf] and ask why we do not acknowledge the patriarchs. Now, we should be the last to grudge to any human being that God should have compassion on him, and bring him out of perdition to salvation. At the same time, we should acknowledge in such a case the clemency shown in this act of compassion, and not the merit of the person whose life is undeniably blameworthy. Thus, in the case of the Jewish fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who are mentioned by Christ in this verse, supposing it to be genuine, although they led wicked lives, as we may learn from their descendant Moses, or whoever was the author of the history called Genesis, which describes their conduct as having been most shocking and detestable we are ready to allow that they may, after all, be in the kingdom of heaven, in the place which they neither believed in, nor hoped for, as is plain enough from their books. But then it must be kept in mind that, as you yourselves confess, if they did attain to what is spoken of in this verse, it was something very different from the nether dungeons of woe to which their own deserts consigned them, and that their deliverance was the work of our Lord Christ, and the result of His mystic passion. Who would grudge to the thief on the cross that deliverance was granted to him by the same Lord, and that Christ said that on that very day he should be with Him in the paradise of His Father?[fn-25-P2540_1535644:2-nf] Who is so hard-hearted as to disapprove of this act of benevolence? Still, it does not follow that, because Jesus pardoned a thief, we must approve of the habits and practices of thieves; any more than of the publicans and harlots, whose faults Jesus pardoned, declaring that they would go into the kingdom of heaven before those who behaved proudly.[fn-25-P2541_1536014:3-nf] For, when He acquitted the woman accused by the Jews as sinful, and as having been caught in adultery, He told her to sin no more.[fn-25-P2542_1536163:4-nf] If, then, He has done something of the same kind in the case of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, all the praise is His; for such actions towards souls are becoming in Him who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and upon the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.[fn-25-P2543_1536459:5-nf] One thing perplexes me in your doctrine: why you limit your statements to the fathers of the Jews, and are not of opinion that the Gentile patriarchs had also a share in this grace of our Redeemer; especially as the Christian Church consists of their children more than of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You will say that the Gentiles worshipped idols, and the Jews the Almighty God, and that therefore Jesus had regard only to the Jews. It would seem from this that the worship of the Almighty God is the sure way to hell, and that the Son must come to the aid of the worshipper of the Father. That is as you please. For my part, I am ready to join you in the belief that the fathers reached heaven, not by any merit of their own, but by that divine mercy which is stronger than sin.","title":"Book XXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"360","folder":"ANF-02","text":"I could adduce ten thousand Scriptures of which not \"one tittle shall pass away,\"[fn-31-P3148_913403:101-nf] without being fulfilled; for the mouth of the Lord the Holy Spirit hath spoken these things. \"Do not any longer,\" he says, \"my son, despise the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him.\"[fn-31-P3149_913632:102-nf] O surpassing love for man! Not as a teacher speaking to his pupils, not as a master to his domestics, nor as God to men, but as a father, does the Lord gently admonish his children. Thus Moses confesses that \"he was filled with quaking and terror\"[fn-31-P3150_913902:103-nf] while he listened to God speaking concerning the Word. And art not thou afraid as thou hearest the voice of the Divine Word? Art not thou distressed? Do you not fear, and hasten to learn of Him,-that is, to salvation,-dreading wrath, loving grace, eagerly striving after the hope set before us, that you may shun the judgment threatened? Come, come, O my young people! For if you become not again as little children, and be born again, as saith the Scripture, you shall not receive the truly existent Father, nor shall you ever enter into the kingdom of heaven. For in what way is a stranger permitted to enter? Well, as I take it, then, when he is enrolled and made a citizen, and receives one to stand to him in the relation of father, then will he be occupied with the Father's concerns, then shall he be deemed worthy to be made His heir, then will he share the kingdom of the Father with His own dear Son. For this is the first-born Church, composed of many good children; these are \"the first-born enrolled in heaven, who hold high festival with so many myriads of angels.\" We, too, are first-born sons, who are reared by God, who are the genuine friends of the First-born, who first of all other men attained to the knowledge of God, who first were wrenched away from our sins, first severed from the devil. And now the more benevolent God is, the more impious men are; for He desires us from slaves to become sons, while they scorn to become sons. O the prodigious folly of being ashamed of the Lord! He offers freedom, you flee into bondage; He bestows salvation, you sink down into destruction; He confers everlasting life, you wait for punishment, and prefer the fire which the Lord \"has prepared for the devil and his angels.\"[fn-31-P3151_915662:104-nf] Wherefore the blessed apostle says: \"I testify in the Lord, that ye walk no longer as the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind; having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart: who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness and concupiscence.\"[fn-31-P3152_916090:105-nf] After the accusation of such a witness, and his invocation of God, what else remains for the unbelieving than judgment and condemnation? And the Lord, with ceaseless assiduity, exhorts, terrifies, urges, rouses, admonishes; He awakes from the sleep of darkness, and raises up those who have wandered in error. \"Awake,\" He says, \"thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light,\"[fn-31-P3153_916523:106-nf] -Christ, the Sun of the Resurrection, He \"who was born before the morning star,\"[fn-31-P3154_916623:107-nf] and with His beams bestows life. Let no one then despise the Word, lest he unwittingly despise himself. For the Scripture somewhere says, \"To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers proved Me by trial.\"[fn-31-P3155_916945:108-nf] And what was the trim? If you wish to learn, the Holy Spirit will show you: \"And saw my works,\" He says, \"forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in heart, and have not known My ways. So I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into My rest.\"[fn-31-P3156_917259:109-nf] Look to the threatening! Look to the exhortation! Look to the punishment! Why, then, should we any longer change grace into wrath, and not receive the word with open ears, and entertain God as a guest in pure spirits? For great is the grace of His promise, \"if to-day we hear His voice.\"[fn-31-P3157_917568:110-nf] And that to-day is lengthened out day by day, while it is called to-day. And to the end the to-day and the instruction continue; and then the true to-day, the never-ending day of God, extends over eternity. Let us then ever obey the voice of the divine word. For the to-day signifies eternity. And day is the symbol of light; and the light of men is the Word, by whom we behold God. Rightly, then, to those that have believed and obey, grace will superabound; while with those that have been unbelieving, and err in heart, and have not known the Lord's ways, which John commanded to make straight and to prepare, God is incensed, and those He threatens.","title":"Exhortation to the Heathen","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":5,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"380","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For what, think you, O men, is the Hermes of Typho, and that of Andocides, and that of Amyetus? Is it not evident to all that they are stones, as is the veritable Hermes himself? As the Halo is not a god, and as the Iris is not a god, but are states of the atmosphere and of the clouds; and as, likewise, a day is not a god, nor a year, nor time, which is made up of these, so neither is sun nor moon, by which each of those mentioned above is determined. Who, then, in his right senses, can imagine Correction, and Punishment, and Justice, and Retribution to be gods? For neither the Furies, nor the Fates, nor Destiny are gods, since neither Government, nor Glory, nor Wealth are gods, which last [as Plutus] painters represent as blind. But if you deify Modesty, and Love, and Venus, let these be followed by Infamy, and Passion, and Beauty, and Intercourse. Therefore Sleep and Death cannot reasonably any more be regarded as twin deities, being merely changes which take place naturally in living creatures; no more will you with propriety call Fortune, or Destiny, or the Fates goddesses. And if Strife and Battle be not gods, no more are Arês and Enyo. Still further, if the lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can fire and water be gods? how can shooting stars and comets, which are produced by atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him also so call Action. If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed by human hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a God, while a providence exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine power,[fn-32-P3204_942177:136-nf] it remains only to acknowledge this, that He alone who is truly God, only truly is and subsists. But those who are insensible to this are like men who have drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God grant that you may at length awake from this slumber, and know God; and that neither Gold, nor Stone, nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor Disease, nor Fear, may appear in your eyes as a god. For there are, in sooth, \"on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand\" demons, not immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life through the force of custom. \"The earth is the Lord's,\" it is said, \"and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-32-P3205_943378:137-nf] Then why darest thou, while luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler? \"Leave my earth,\" the Lord will say to thee. \"Touch not the water which I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my husbandry\" Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge thy Master. Thou art God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of truth. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more mystically, like the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot's wife, are ye not turned into a state of insensibility? This woman we have heard, was turned into stone for her love of Sodore. And those who are godless, addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish are Sodomites. Believe that these utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred,[fn-32-P3206_944473:138-nf] and take beasts and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of human kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and honour the raven as a messenger of God. But the man of God, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither welcoming the grace which, comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose love to man is ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His anger augments punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind, deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe, and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the knowledge of God; nor does any one who has conquered[fn-32-P3207_946125:139-nf] by brass or iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and God, where is neither moth,[fn-32-P3208_946659:140-nf] robber, nor pirate, but the eternal Giver of good. With justice, then, have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For \"their mind,\" says the Scripture, \"is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers.\"[fn-32-P3209_946988:141-nf] But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of sanctity, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of destruction, as they[fn-32-P3210_947371:142-nf] have been divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions.[fn-32-P3211_947654:143-nf] \"For the enemies of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"shall lick the dust.\"[fn-32-P3212_947866:144-nf] Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart to contain God. \"Trust in Him, all ye assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him.\"[fn-32-P3213_948438:145-nf] He says to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, \"He pities them, and fills them with righteousness.\" Believe Him who is man and God; believe, O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is adored. Believe, ye slaves,[fn-32-P3214_948694:146-nf] Him who died; believe, all ye of human kind, Him who alone is God of all men. Believe, and receive salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation. Hast thou found God?-then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with God. \"Let all who seek Thee be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God be magnified.\"[fn-32-P3215_949221:147-nf] A noble hymn of God is an immortal man, established in righteousness, in whom the oracles of truth are engraved. For where but in a soul that is wise can you write truth? where love? where reverence? where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of salvation: wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the Father, have proved good fathers to their children; and good parents to their sons, those who have known the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants,[fn-32-P3216_949950:148-nf] those who have been redeemed from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in error! who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth. There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no superstition: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to know God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the knowledge of God, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of salvation. You have become old in superstition; as young, enter on the practice of piety. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the laws of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if thou enrol thyself as one of God's people, heaven is thy country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the laws? \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not seduce boys; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt love the Lord thy God.\"[fn-32-P3217_951387:149-nf] And the complements of these are those laws. of reason and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men's hearts: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes thee on the cheek, present also the other; \"[fn-32-P3218_951643:150-nf] \"thou shalt not lust, for by lust alone thou hast committed adultery.\"[fn-32-P3219_951734:151-nf] How much better, therefore, is it for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of salvation; but as we delight in sweet' things, and prize them higher for the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand, those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak stomach, thus custom pleases and, tickles; but custom pushes into the abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our constitution-in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this of truth, which is embraced by these three things in all-will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath filled the universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily to men, having dawned from His Father's counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us. Whence He was and what He was, He showed by what He taught and exhibited, manifesting Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the Reconciler, our Saviour, the Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of peace, diffused over the whole face of the earth; by whom, so to speak, the universe has already become an ocean of blessings.[fn-32-P3220_954384:152-nf] ","title":"Exhortation to the Heathen","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":5,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_42_on_the_baptism_of_christ","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Even these instances might be enough to confirm our present position; but the lover of good thoughts must yet not neglect what follows. The people of the Hebrews, as we learn, after many sufferings, and after accomplishing their weary course in the desert, did not enter the land of promise until it had first been brought, with Joshua for its guide and the pilot of its life, to the passage of the Jordan[fn-41-P4181_2762977:25-nf] . But it is clear that Joshua also, who set up the twelve stones in the stream[fn-41-P4182_2763076:26-nf] , was anticipating the coming of the twelve disciples, the ministers of Baptism. Again, that marvellous sacrifice of the old Tishbite[fn-41-P4183_2763229:27-nf] , that passes all human understanding, what else does it do but prefigure in action the Faith in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and redemption? For when all the people of the Hebrews had trodden underfoot the religion of their fathers, and fallen into the error of polytheism, and their king Ahab was deluded by idolatry, with Jezebel, of ill-omened name, as the wicked partner of his life, and the vile prompter of his impiety, the prophet, filled with the grace of the Spirit, coming to a meeting with Ahab, withstood the priests of Baal in a marvellous and wondrous contest in the sight of the king and all the people; and by proposing to them the task of sacrificing the bullock without fire, he displayed them in a ridiculous and wretched plight, vainly praying and crying aloud to gods that were not. At last, himself invoking his own and the true God, he accomplished the test proposed with further exaggerations and additions. For he did not simply by prayer bring down the fire from heaven upon the wood when it was dry, but exhorted and enjoined the attendants to bring abundance of water. And when he had thrice poured out the barrels upon the cleft wood, he kindled at his prayer the fire from out of the water, that by the contrariety of the elements, so concurring in friendly cooperation, he might show with superabundant force the power of his own God. Now herein, I by that wondrous sacrifice, Elijah clearly proclaimed to us the sacramental rite of Baptism that should afterwards be instituted. For the fire was kindled by water thrice poured upon it, so that it is clearly shown that where the mystic water is, there is the kindling, warm, and fiery Spirit, that burns up the ungodly, and illuminates the faithful. Yes, and yet again his disciple Elisha, when Naaman the Syrian, who was diseased with leprosy, had come to him as a suppliant, cleanses the sick man by washing him in Jordan[fn-41-P4184_2765171:28-nf] , clearly indicating what should come, both by the use of water generally, and by the dipping in the river in particular. For Jordan alone of rivers, receiving in itself the first-fruits of sanctification and benediction, conveyed in its channel to the whole world, as it were from some fount in the type afforded by itself, the grace of Baptism. These then are indications in deed and act of regeneration by Baptism. Let us for the rest consider the prophecies of it in words and language. Isaiah cried saying, \"Wash you, make you clean, put away evil from your souls[fn-41-P4185_2765760:29-nf] ;\" and David, \"Draw nigh to Him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed[fn-41-P4186_2765871:30-nf] .\" And Ezekiel, writing more clearly and plainly than them both, says, \"And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I give you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and my Spirit will I put within you[fn-41-P4187_2766307:31-nf] .\" Most manifestly also does Zechariah prophesy of Joshua[fn-41-P4188_2766410:32-nf] , who was clothed with the filthy garment (to wit, the flesh of a servant, even ours), and stripping him of his ill-favoured raiment adorns him with the clean arid fair apparel; teaching us by the figurative illustration that verily in the Baptism of Jesus[fn-41-P4189_2766795:33-nf] all we, putting off our sins like some poor and patched garment, are clothed in the holy and most fair garment of regeneration. And where shall we place that oracle of Isaiah, which cries to the wilderness, \"Be glad, O thirsty wilderness: let the desert rejoice and blossom as a lily: and the desolate places of Jordan shall blossom and shall rejoice[fn-41-P4190_2767454:34-nf] \"? For it is clear that it is not to places without soul or sense that he proclaims the good tidings of joy: but he speaks, by the figure of the desert, of the soul that is parched and unadorned, even as David also, when he says, \"My soul is unto Thee as a thirsty land[fn-41-P4191_2767762:35-nf] ,\" and, \"My soul is athirst for the mighty, for the living God[fn-41-P4192_2767852:36-nf] .\" So again the Lord says in the Gospels, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink[fn-41-P4193_2767977:37-nf] ;\" and to the woman of Samaria, \"Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst[fn-41-P4194_2768162:38-nf] .\" And \"the excellency of Carmel\"[fn-41-P4195_2768229:39-nf] is given to the soul that bears the likeness to the desert, that is, the grace bestowed through the Spirit. For since Elijah dwelt in Carmel, and the mountain became famous and renowned by the virtue of him who dwelt there, and since moreover John the Baptist, illustrious in the spirit of Elijah, sanctified the Jordan, therefore the prophet foretold that \"the excellency of Carmel\" should be given to the river. And \"the glory of Lebanon[fn-41-P4196_2768687:40-nf] ,\" from the similitude of its lofty trees, he transfers to the river. For as great Lebanon presents a sufficient cause of wonder in the very trees which it brings forth and nourishes, so is the Jordan glorified by regenerating men and planting them in the Paradise of God: and of them, as the words of the Psalmist say, ever blooming and bearing the foliage of virtues, \"the leaf shall not wither[fn-41-P4197_2769099:41-nf] ,\" and God shall be glad, receiving their fruit in due season, rejoicing, like a good planter, in his own works. And the inspired David, foretelling also the voice which the Father uttered from heaven upon the Son at His Baptism, that He might lead the hearers, who till then had looked upon that low estate of His Humanity which was perceptible by their senses, to the dignity of nature that belongs to the Godhead, wrote in his book that passage, \"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters, the voice of the Lord in majesty[fn-41-P4198_2769663:42-nf] .\" But here we must make an end of the testimonies from the Divine Scriptures: for the discourse would extend to an infinite length if one should seek to select every passage in detail, and set them forth in a single book.","title":"On the Baptism of Christ","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_47_concerning_the_nature_of_good_against_the_manichaeans_","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"141","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"O great is Thy patience, Lord, full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and true;[fn-27-P2752_1621893:50-nf] who makest Thy sun to rise upon the good and the evil, and who sendest rain upon the just and the unjust;[fn-27-P2753_1622017:51-nf] who willest not the death of the sinner, so much as that he return and live;[fn-27-P2754_1622112:52-nf] who reproving in parts, dost give place to repentance, that wickedness having been abandoned, they may believe on Thee, O Lord;[fn-27-P2755_1622264:53-nf] who by Thy patience dost lead to repentance, although many according to the hardness of their heart and their impenitent heart treasure up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath and of the revelation of Thy righteous judgment, who wilt render to every man according to his works;[fn-27-P2756_1622570:54-nf] who in the day when a man shall have turned from his iniquity to Thy mercy and truth, wilt forget all his iniquities:[fn-27-P2757_1622707:55-nf] stand before us, grant unto us that through our ministry, by which Thou hast been pleased to refute this execrable and too horrible error, as many have already been liberated, many also may be liberated, and whether through the sacrament Of Thy holy baptism, or through the sacrifice of a broken spirit and a contrite and humbled heart,[fn-27-P2758_1623066:56-nf] in the sorrow of repentance, they may deserve to receive the remission of their sins and blasphemies, by which through ignorance they have offended Thee.

To love even enemies, and love them for this end, that they may be brethren. For not a carnal love ought ours to be. To wish a man temporal weal, is good; but though that fail, let the soul be safe. Dost thou wish life to any that is thy friend? Thou doest well. Dost thou rejoice at the death of thine enemy? Thou doest ill. But haply both to thy friend the life thou wishest him is not for his good, and to thine enemy the death thou rejoicest at hath been for his good. It is uncertain whether this present life be profitable to any man or unprofitable: but the life which is with God without doubt is profitable. So love thine enemies as to wish them to become thy brethren; so love thine enemies as that they may be called into thy fellowship. For so loved He who, hanging on the cross, said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-40-P4014_2209221:49-nf] For he did not say, Father let them live long, me indeed they kill, but let them live. He was casting out from them the death which is for ever and ever, by His most merciful prayer, and by His most surpassing might. Many of them believed, and the shedding of the blood of Christ was forgiven them. At first they shed it while they raged; now they drank it while they believed. \"In this we know that we are in Him, if in Him we be made perfect.\" Touching the very perfection of love of enemies, the Lord admonishing, saith, \"Be yetherefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect.[fn-40-P4015_2209827:50-nf] He,\" therefore, \"that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\"[fn-40-P4016_2209943:51-nf] How, brethren what cloth he advise us? \"He that saith he abideth in Him,\" i.e., in Christ, \"ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.\" Haply the advice is this, that we should walk on the sea?

For that ye may know that they are blind, they have stumbled at a Mountain. I say the same things often, that they may not slip out of your memory. The Stone which was \"cut out of the Mountain without hands,\" is it not Christ, who came of the kingdom of the Jews, without the work of man?[fn-40-P4042_2220767:73-nf] Has not that Stone broken in pieces all the kingdoms of the earth, that is, all the dominations of idols and demons?

For example, when they wish people to see the new moon, they say, Lo, the moon! lo, where it is! and if there be some there who are not sharp-sighted, and say, Where then the finger is put forth that they may see it. Sometimes when they are ashamed to be thought blind, they say they have seen what they have not seen. Do we in this way point out the Church, my brethren? Is it not open? Is it not manifest? Has it not possessed all nations? Is not that fulfilled which so many .years before was promised to Abraham, that in his seed should all nations be blessed?[fn-40-P4044_2222027:75-nf] It was promised to one believer, and the world is filled with thousands of believers. Behold here the mountain filling the whole face of the earth! Behold the city of which it is said, \"A city set upon a mountain cannot be hid!\"[fn-40-P4045_2222276:76-nf] But those stumble at the mountain, and when it is said to them, Go up; \"There is no mountain,\" say they, and dash their heads against it sooner than seek a habitation there. Esaias was read yesterday; whosoever of you was awake not with his eyes only but with his ear, and not the ear of the body but the ear of the heart, noted this; \"In the last days shall the mountain of the house of the Lord be manifest, prepared upon the top of the mountains.\"[fn-40-P4046_2222745:77-nf] What so manifest as a mountain?

These mountains are in different parts of the earth. But not so that Mountain, for it hath filled the whole face of the earth, and of it is said, \"Prepared upon the top of the mountains.\" It is a Mountain above the tops of all mountains. \"And,\" saith he, \"to it shall be gathered all nations.\" Who can fail to be aware of this Mountain? Who breaks his head by stumbling against it? Who is ignorant of the city set upon a mountain? But marvel not that it is unknown by these who hate the brethren, because they walk in darkness and know not whither they go, because the darkness hath blinded their eyes. They do not see the Mountain: I would not have thee marvel; they have no eyes. How is it they have no eyes? Because the darkness hath blinded them. How do we prove this?

For what the Lord said, \"If ye have known me, ye have known my Father also: and henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him,\"[fn-103-P10397_3273379:222-nf] He said not as wishing to be understood Himself to be the Father, but implying that he who thoroughly, and fully, and with all faith and all religiousness, drew near to the Son of God, by all means shall attain, through the Son Himself, in whom he thus believes, to the Father, and shall see Him. \"For no one,\" says He, \"can come to the Father, but by me.\"[fn-103-P10398_3273757:223-nf] And therefore he shall not only come to God the Father, and shall know the Father Himself; but, moreover, he ought thus to hold, and so to presume in mind and heart, that he has henceforth not only known, but seen the Father. For often the divine Scripture announces things that are not yet done as being done, because thus they shall be; and things which by all means have to happen, it does not predict as if they were future, but narrates as if they were done. And thus, although Christ had not been born as yet in the times of Isaiah the prophet, he said, \"For unto us a child is born; \"[fn-103-P10399_3274371:224-nf] and although Mary had not yet been approached, he said, \"' And I approached unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.\"[fn-104-P10400_3274524:225-nf] And when Christ had not yet made known the mind of the Father, it is said, \"And His name shall be called the Angel of Great Counsel.\"[fn-104-P10401_3274680:226-nf] And when He had not yet suffered, he declared, \"He is as a sheep led to the slaughter.\"[fn-104-P10402_3274820:227-nf] And although the cross had never yet existed, He said, \"All day long have I stretched out my hands to an unbelieving people.\"[fn-104-P10403_3274968:228-nf] And although not yet had He been scornfully given to drink, the Scripture says, \"In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\"[fn-104-P10404_3275115:229-nf] And although He had not yet been stripped, He said, \"Upon my vesture they did cast lots, and they numbered my bones: they pierced my hands and my feet.\"[fn-104-P10405_3275290:230-nf] For the divine Scripture, foreseeing, speaks of things which it knows shall be as being already done, and speaks of things as perfected which it regards as future, but which shall come to pass without any doubt. And thus the Lord in the present passage said, \"Henceforth ye have known and have seen Him.\" Now He said that the Father should be seen by whomsoever had followed the Son, not as if the Son Himself should be the Father seen, but that whosoever was willing to follow Him, and be His disciple, should obtain the reward of being able to see the Father. For He also is the image of God the Father; so that it is added, moreover, to these things, that \"as the Father worketh, so also the Son worketh.\"[fn-104-P10406_3276024:231-nf] And the Son is an imitator[fn-104-P10407_3276071:232-nf] of all the Father's works, so that every one may regard it just as if he saw the Father, when he sees Him who always imitates the invisible Father in all His works. But if Christ is the Father Himself, in what manner does He immediately add, and say, \"Whosoever believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father?[fn-104-P10408_3276496:233-nf] And He further subjoins, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments; and I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.\"[fn-104-P10409_3276649:234-nf] After which also He adds this: \"If any one loveth me, he shall keep my word: and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and will make our abode with him.\"[fn-104-P10410_3276842:235-nf] Moreover, also, He added this too: \"But the Advocate, that Holy Spirit whom the Father will send, He will teach you, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-104-P10411_3277057:236-nf] He utters, further, that passage when He shows Himself to be the Son, and reasonably subjoins, and says, \"If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.\"[fn-104-P10412_3277283:237-nf] But what shall we say when He also continues in these words: \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit He purgeth, that it may bring forth more fruit? \"[fn-104-P10413_3277564:238-nf] Still He persists, and adds: \"As the Father hath loved me, so also have I loved you: remain in my love. If ye have kept my commandments, ye shall remain in my love; even as I have kept the Father's commandments, and remain in His love.\"[fn-104-P10414_3277821:239-nf] Further, He says in addition: \"But I have called you friends; for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\"[fn-104-P10415_3277983:240-nf] Moreover, He adds to all this: \"But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not Him that sent me.\"[fn-104-P10416_3278141:241-nf] These things then, after the former, evidently attesting Him to be not the Father but the Son, the Lord would never have added, if He had had it in mind, either that He was the Father, or wished Himself to be understood as the Father, except that He might declare this, that every man ought henceforth to consider, in seeing the image of God the Father through the Son, that it was as if he saw the Father; since every one believing on the Son may be exercised in the contemplation of the likeness, so that, being accustomed to seeing the divinity in likeness, he may go forward, and grow even to the perfect contemplation of God the Father Almighty. And since he who has imbibed this truth into his mind and soul, and has believed of all things that thus it shall be, he shall even now see, as it were, in some measure the Father whom he will see hereafter; and he may so regard it, as if he actually held, what he knows for certain that he shall one day hold. But if Christ Himself had been the Father, why did He promise as future, a reward which He had already granted and given? For that He says, \"Blessed are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God,\"[fn-104-P10417_3279325:242-nf] it is understood to promise the contemplation and vision of the Father; therefore He had not given this; for why should He promise if He had already given? For He had given if He was the Father: for He was seen, and He was touched, But since, when Christ Himself is seen and touched, He still promises, and says that he who is of a pure heart shall see God, He proves by this very saying that He who was then present was not the Father, seeing that He was seen, and yet promised that whoever should be of a pure heart should see the Father. It was therefore not the Father, but the Son, who promised this, because He who was the Son promised that which had yet to be seen; and His promise would have been superfluous unless He had been the Son. For why did He promise to the pure in heart that they should see the Father, if already they who were then present saw Christ as the Father? But because He was the Son, not the Father, rightly also He was then seen as the Son, because He was the image of God; and the Father, because He is invisible, is promised and pointed out as to be seen by the pure in heart. Let it then be enough to have suggested even these points against that heretic; a few words about many things. For a field which is indeed both wide and expansive would be laid open if we should desire to discuss that heretic more fully; seeing that bereaved, in these two particulars, as it were of his eyes plucked out, he is altogether overcome in the blindness of his doctrine.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_135_homily_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5.

Sixthly, let it be asserted that it is written, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.[fn-45-P4530_1426571:39-nf] The solution of this is as follows:-Can and Cannot are not words with only one meaning, but have many meanings. On the one hand they are used sometimes in respect of deficiency of strength, sometimes in respect of time, and sometimes relatively to a certain object; as for instance, A Child cannot be an Athlete, or, A Puppy cannot see, or fight with so and so. Perhaps some day the child will be an athlete, the puppy will see, will fight with that other, though it may still be unable to fight with Any other. Or again, they may be used of that which is Generally true. For instance,-A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid;[fn-45-P4531_1427218:40-nf] while yet it might possibly be hidden by another higher hill being in a line with it. Or in another sense they are used of a thing which is not reasonable; as, Can the Children of the Bridechamber fast while the Bridegroom is with them;[fn-45-P4532_1427473:41-nf] whether He be considered as visible in bodily form (for the time of His sojourning among us was not one of mourning, but of gladness), or, as the Word. For why should they keep a bodily fast who are cleansed by the Word?[fn-45-P4533_1427713:42-nf] Or, again, they are used of that which is contrary to the will; as in, He could do no mighty works there because of their unbelief,[fn-45-P4534_1427862:43-nf] -i.e. of those who should receive them. For since in order to healing there is need of both faith in the patient and power in the Healer,[fn-45-P4535_1428018:44-nf] when one of the two failed the other was impossible.

The obscurity of the things compels us to speak much at length, chiefly that that which the Lord deigns to reveal may be brought within reach even of the brethren of slower understanding, because all were bought by the blood of Christ.

When, then, on being cursed, I smite (with my tongue, ) how shall I be found to have followed the doctrine of the Lord, in which it has been delivered that \"a man is defiled,[fn-123-P12307_3441611:91-nf] not by the defilements of vessels, but of the things which are sent forth out of his mouth.\" Again, it is said that \"impeachment[fn-123-P12308_3441863:92-nf] awaits us for every vain and needless word.\"[fn-123-P12309_3441985:93-nf] It follows that, from whatever the Lord keeps us, the same He admonishes us to bear patiently from another. I will add (somewhat) touching the pleasure of patience. For every injury, whether inflicted by tongue or hand, when it has lighted upon patience, will be dismissed[fn-123-P12310_3442335:94-nf] with the same fate as, some weapon launched against and blunted on a rock of most stedfast hardness. For it will wholly fall then and there with bootless and fruitless labour; and sometimes will recoil and spend its rage on him who sent it out, with retorted impetus. No doubt the reason why any one hurts you is that you may be pained; because the hurter's enjoyment consists in the pain of the hurt. When, then, you have upset his enjoyment by not being pained, he must needs he pained by the loss of his enjoyment. Then you not only go unhurt away, which even alone is enough for you; but gratified, into the bargain, by your adversary's disappointment, and revenged by his pain. This is the utility and the pleasure of patience.","title":"Of Patience.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-03","text":"After these principal material causes of impatience, registered to the best of our ability, why should we wander out of our way among the rest,-what are found at home, what abroad?

For so he makes unto himself either a huge form, or a certain incalculable magnitude which, like the light which he sees with the bodily eyes, he makes extend through all directions; field after field of space he gives it all the bigness he can; or, he represents to himself like as it were an old man of venerable form. None of these things do thou imagine. There is something thou mayest imagine, if thou wouldest see God; \"God is love.\" What sort of face hath love? what form hath it? what stature? what feet? what hands hath it? no man can say. And yet it hath feet, for these carry men to church: it hath hands; for these reach forth to the poor: it hath eyes; for thereby we consider the needy: \"Blessed is the man,\" it is said, \"who considereth the needy and the poor.\"[fn-44-P4472_2413201:32-nf] Ithath ears, of which the Lord saith, \"He that hath ears to hear let him hear.\"[fn-44-P4473_2413298:33-nf] Theseare not members distinct by place, but with the understanding he that hath charity sees the whole at once. Inhabit, and thou shalt be inhabited; dwell, and thou shalt be dwelt in. For how say you, my brethren? who loves what he does not see? Now why, when charity is praised, do ye lift up your hands, make acclaim, praise? What have I shown you? What I produced, was it a gleam of colors? What I propounded, was it gold and silver? Have I dug out jewels from hid treasures? What of this sort have I shown to your eyes? Is my face changed while I speak? I am in the flesh; I am in the same form in which I came forth to you; ye are in the same form in which ye came hither charity is praised, and ye shout applause. Certainly ye see nothing. But as it pleases you when ye praise, so let it please you that ye may keep it in your heart. For mark well what I say brethren; I exhort you all, as God enables me, unto a great treasure. If there were shown you a beautiful little vase, embossed,[fn-44-P4474_2414312:34-nf] inlaid with gold, curiously wrought, and it charmed your eyes, and drew towards it the eager desire of your heart, and you were pleased with the hand of the artificer, and the weight of the silver, and the splendor of the metal; would not each one of you say, \"O, if I had that vase!\" And to no purpose ye would say it, for it would not rest with you to have it. Or if one should wish to have it, he might think of stealing it from another's house. Charity is praised to you; if it please you, have it, possess it: no need that ye should rob any man, no need that ye should think of buying it; it is to be had freely, without cost. Take it, clasp it; there is nothing sweeter. If such it be when it is but spoken of, what must it be when one has it?","title":"Homily VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-02","text":"But the husbandry is twofold,-the one unwritten, and the other written.

Who is that adulterous woman whom the prophet Hosea points out, who said, \"I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and everything that befits me?\"[fn-33-P3390_1939996:56-nf] Let us grant that we may understand this also of the people of the Jews that went astray; yet whom else are the false Christians (such as are all heretics and schismatics) wont to imitate, except false Israelites? For there were also true Israelites, as the Lord Himself bears witness to Nathanael, \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.\"[fn-33-P3391_1940372:57-nf] But who are true Christians, save those of whom the same Lord said, \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me?\"[fn-33-P3392_1940532:58-nf] But what is it to keep His commandments, except to abide in love?

For He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill.[fn-33-P3394_1941110:60-nf] But the fulfilling of the law is love.[fn-33-P3395_1941167:61-nf] And in this Cyprian abounded greatly, insomuch that though he held a different view concerning baptism, he yet did not forsake the unity of the Church, and was in the Lord's vine a branch firmly rooted, bearing fruit, which the heavenly Husbandman purged with the knife of suffering, that it should bear more fruit.[fn-33-P3396_1941503:62-nf] But the enemies of this brotherly love, whether they are openly without, or appear to be within, are false Christians, and antichrists. For when they have found an opportunity, they go out, as it is written: \"A man wishing to separate himself from his friends, seeketh opportunities.\"[fn-33-P3397_1941807:63-nf] But even if occasions are wanting, while they seem to be within, they are severed from that invisible bond of love. Whence St. John says, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.\"[fn-33-P3398_1942106:64-nf] He does not say that they ceased to be of us by going out, but that they went out because they were not of us. The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the truth, and were overthrowing the faith of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonor,-I suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they had already gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the honorable vessels, unless it was in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the severed meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to honor and some to dishonor? For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: \"But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, andsome to dishonor. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.\"[fn-33-P3399_1943743:65-nf] But what is it to purge oneself from such as these, except what he said just before, \"Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\" And lest any one should think that, as being in one great house with them, he might perish with such as these, he has most carefully forewarned them, \"The Lord knoweth them that are His,\"-those, namely, who, by departing from iniquity, purge themselves from the vessels made to dishonor, lest they should perish with them whom they are compelled to tolerate in the great house.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_139_homily_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2.

What said it? \"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them.\"[fn-44-P4492_2423278:3-nf] Did He mean to say this, that whatever good things we do, we should hide them from the eyes of men,[fn-44-P4493_2423394:4-nf] and fear to be seen? If thou fearest spectators thou wilt not have imitators: thou oughtest therefore to be seen. But thou must not do it to the end thou mayest be seen. Not there should be the end of thy joy, not there the goal of thy rejoicing, that thou shouldest account thyself to have gotten the whole fruit of thy good work, when thou art seen and praised. This is nothing. Despise thyself when thou art praised, let Him be praised in thee who worketh by thee. Therefore do not for thine own praise work the good thou doest: but to the praise of Him from whom thou hast the power to do good. From thyself thou hast the ill doing, from God thou hast the well doing. On the other hand, see perverse men, how preposterous they are. What they do well, they will needs ascribe to themselves; if they do ill, they will needs accuse God. Reverse this distorted and preposterous proceeding, which puts the thing, as one may say, head downwards, which makes that undermost which is uppermost,[fn-44-P4494_2424491:5-nf] and that upwards which is downwards. Dost thou want to make God undermost and thyself uppermost? Thou goest headlong, not elevatest thyself; for He is always above. What then? thou well, and God ill? nay rather, say this, if thou wouldest speak more truly, I ill, He well; and what I do well from Him is the well-doing: for from myself whatever I do is ill. This confession strengthens the heart, and makes a firm foundation of love. For if we ought to hide our good works lest they be seen of men, what becomes of that sentence of the Lord in the sermon which He delivered on the mount? Where He said this, there He also said a little before, \"Let your good works shine before men.\"[fn-44-P4495_2425447:6-nf] And He did not stop there, did not there make an end, but added, \"And glorify your Father which is in Heaven.\" And what saith the apostle? \"And I was unknown by face unto the Churches of Judea which were in Christ: but they heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. And in me they glorified God.\"[fn-44-P4496_2425822:7-nf] See how he also, in regard that he became so widely known did not set the good in his own praise, but in the praise of God. And as for him, in his own person, that he was one who laid waste the Church, a persecutor, envious, malignant, it is himself that confesses this, not we that reproach him therewith. Paul loves to have his sins spoken of by us, that He may be glorified who healed such a disease. For it was the hand of the Physician that cut end healed the greatness of the sore. That voice from heaven prostrated the persecutor, and raised up the preacher; killed Saul, and quickened Paul.[fn-44-P4497_2426439:8-nf] For Saul was the persecutor of a holy man; thence had this man his name, when he persecuted the Christians:[fn-44-P4498_2426568:9-nf] afterward of Saul he became Paul. What does the name Paulus mean? Little. Therefore when he was Saul, he was proud, lifted up; when he was Paul, he was lowly, little, Thus we say, I will see thee \"paulo post,\" i.e. after a little while.[fn-44-P4499_2426821:10-nf] Hear that he was made little: \"For I am the least of the apostles;[fn-45-P4500_2427767:11-nf] and, To me the least of all saints,\" he saith in another place.

But concerning love of an enemy, almost throughout the epistle, he has said nothing. Although he vehemently preaches up and commends charity to us, he does not tell us to love our enemies, but tells us to love our brethren.

Do not even the publicans this? \"[fn-45-P4506_2429826:15-nf] How is it then that John the apostle, as the thing of great concern to us in order to a certain perfection, commends brotherly love; whereas the Lord saith it is not enough that we love our brethren, but that we ought to extend that love so that we may reach even to enemies? He that reaches even unto enemies does not overleap the brethren. It must needs, like fire, first seize upon what is nearest, and so extend to what is further off. A brother is nearer to thee than any chance person. Again, that person has more hold upon thee whom thou knowest not, who yet is not against thee, than an enemy who is also against thee. Extend thy love to them that are nearest, yet do not call this an extending: for it is almost loving thyself, to love them that are close to thee Extend it to the unknown, who have done thee no ill.

And see what great works pride does. Lay it up in your hearts, how much alike, how much as it were upon a par, are the works it doeth, and the works of charity. Charity feeds the hungry, and so does pride: charity, that God may be praised; pride, that itself may be praised. Charity clothes the naked, so does pride: charity fasts, so does pride: charity buries the dead, so does pride. All good works which charity wishes to do, and does; pride, on the other hand, drives at the same, and, so to say, keeps her horses up to the mark. But charity is between her and it, and leaves not place for ill-driven pride; not ill-driving, but ill-driven. Woe to the man whose charioteer is pride, for he must needs go headlong! But that, in the good that is done, it may not be pride that sets us on, who knows? who sees it? where is it? the works we see: mercy feeds, pride also feeds; mercy takes in the stranger, pride also takes in the stranger; mercy intercedes for the poor, pride also intercedes. How is this? In the works we see no difference. I dare to say somewhat, but not I; Paul hath said it: charity dies, that is, a man having charity confesses the name of Christ, suffers martyrdom: pride also confesses, suffers also martyrdom. The one hath charity, the other hath not charity. But let him that hath not charity hear from the apostle: \"If I distribute all my goods to the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.[fn-45-P4527_2441915:31-nf] So then the divine Scripture calls us off from the display of the face outwardly to that which is within; from this surface which is vaunted before men, it calls us off to that which is within. Return to thy own conscience, question it. Do not consider what blossoms outwardly, but what root there is in the ground. Is lust rooted there? A show there may be of good deeds, truly good works there cannot be. Is charity rooted there? Have no fear: nothing evil can come of that. The proud caresses, love[fn-45-P4528_2442438:32-nf] is severe. The one clothes, the other smites. For the one clothes in order toplease men, the other smites in order to correct by discipline. More accepted is the blow of charity than the alms of pride. Come then within, brethren; and in all things, whatsoever ye do, look unto God your witness. See, if He seeth, with what mind ye do it. If your heart accuse you not that ye do it for the sake of display, it is well: fear ye not. But when ye do good, fear not test another see you. Fear thou lest thou do it to the end that thou mayest be praised: let the other see it, that God may be praised. For if thou hidest it from the eyes of man, thou hidest it from the imitation of man, thou withdrawest from God His praise. Two are there to whom thou doest the alms: two hunger; one for bread, the other for righteousness. Between these two famishing souls:-as it is written, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled:\"[fn-45-P4529_2443412:33-nf] - between these two famishing persons thou the doer of the good work art set; if charity does the work by occasion of the one, therein it hath pity on both, it would succor both.

With regard to the objection brought against Cyprian, that the catechumens who were seized in martyrdom, and slain for Christ's name's sake, received a crown even without baptism, I do not quite see what it has to do with the matter, unless, indeed, they urged that heretics could much more be admitted with baptism to Christ's kingdom, to which catechumens were admitted without it, since He Himself has said, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-35-P3598_2017628:121-nf] Now, in this matter I do not hesitate for a moment to place the Catholic catechumen, who is burning with love for God, before the baptized heretic; nor yet do we thereby do dishonor to the sacrament of baptism which the latter has already received, the former not as yet; nor do we consider that the sacrament of the catechumen[fn-35-P3599_2017976:122-nf] is to be preferred to the sacrament of baptism, when we acknowledge that some catechumens are better and more faithful than some baptized persons. For the centurion Cornelius, before baptism, was better than Simon, who had been baptized. For Cornelius, even before his baptism, was filled with the Holy Spirit;[fn-36-P3600_2019026:123-nf] Simon, even after baptism, was puffed up with an unclean spirit.[fn-36-P3601_2019110:124-nf] Cornelius, however, would have been convicted of contempt for so holy a sacrament, if, even after he had received the Holy Ghost, he had refused to be baptized. But when he was baptized, he received in no wise a better sacrament than Simon; but the different merits of the men were made manifest under the equal holiness of the same sacrament-so true is it that the good or ill deserving of the recipient does not increase or diminish the holiness of baptism. But as baptism is wanting to a good catechumen to his receiving the kingdom of heaven, so true conversion is wanting to a bad man though baptized. For He who said, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit. he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,\" said also Himself, \"except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven:\"[fn-36-P3602_2020018:125-nf] For that the righteousness of the catechumens might not feel secure, it is written, \"Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" And again, that the unrighteousness of the baptized might not feel secure because they had received baptism, it is written, \"Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" The one were too little without the other; the two make perfect the heir of that inheritance. As, then, we ought not to depreciate a man's righteousness, which begins to exist before he is joined to the Church, as the righteousness of Cornelius began to exist before he was in the body of Christian men,-which righteousness was not thought worthless, or the angel would not have said to him, \"Thy prayers and thine alms are come up as a memorial before God;\" nor did it yet suffice for his obtaining the kingdom of heaven, or he would not have been told to send to Peter,[fn-36-P3603_2021059:126-nf] -so neither ought we to depreciate the sacrament of baptism, even though it has been received outside the Church. But since it is of no avail for salvation unless he who has baptism indeed in full perfection be incorporated into the Church, correcting also his own depravity, let us therefore correct the error of the heretics, that we may recognize what in them is not their own but Christ's.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_14_tractate_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"16.

How much more then will they come to an end hereafter, when \"this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,\"[fn-35-P3522_1316067:9-nf] and the body which is now \"a natural body\" shall have risen \"a spiritual body\"[fn-35-P3523_1316165:10-nf] and the flesh shall have begun to be such that it no longer lusts against the spirit? And of this the blessed Apostle also clearly speaks, when he says that \"bodily exercise is profitable for a little: but godliness (by which he certainly means love) \"is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.\"[fn-35-P3524_1316541:11-nf] This clearly shows that what is said to be useful for a little, is not to be practised for all time, and cannot possibly by itself alone confer the highest state of perfection on the man who slaves at it. For the term \"for a little\" may mean either of the two things, i.e., it may refer to the shortness of the time, because bodily exercise cannot possibly last on with man both in this life and in the world to come: or it may refer to the smallness of the profit which results from exercising the flesh, because bodily austerities produce some sort of beginnings of progress, but not the actual perfection of love, which has the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come: and therefore we deem that the practice of the aforesaid works is needful, because without them we cannot climb the heights of love. For what you call works of religion and mercy are needful in this life while these inequalities and differences of conditions still prevail; but even here we should not look for them to be performed, unless such a large proportion of poor, needy, and sick folk abounded, which is brought about by the wickedness of men; viz., of those who have grasped and kept for their own use (without however using them) those things which were granted to all by the Creator of all alike. As long then as this inequality lasts in this world, this sort of work will be needful and useful to the man that practises it, as it brings to a good purpose and pious will the reward of an eternal inheritance: but it will come to an end in the life to come, where equality will reign, when there will be no longer inequality, on account of which these things must be done, but all men will pass from these manifold practical works to the love of God, and contemplation of heavenly things in continual purity of heart: to which those men who are urgent in devoting themselves to knowledge and purifying the heart, have chosen to give themselves up with all their might and main, betaking themselves, while they are still in the flesh, to that duty, in which they are to continue, when they have laid aside corruption, and when they come to that promise of the Lord the Saviour, which says \"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.\"[fn-35-P3525_1318808:12-nf] ","title":"I.

If, however, He was Himself not to suffer, but should fly away from Jesus, why did He exhort His disciples to take up the cross and follow Him,-that cross which these men represent Him as not having taken up, but [speak of Him] as having relinquished the dispensation of suffering? For that He did not say this with reference to the acknowledging of the Stauros (cross) above, as some among them venture to expound, but with respect to the suffering which He should Himself undergo, and that His disciples should endure, He implies when He says, \"For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose, shall find it.

For this purpose did He give them this exhortation: \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to send both soul and body into hell; \"[fn-77-P7768_2120849:346-nf] [thus exhorting them] to hold fast those professions of faith which they had made in reference to Him.

And although these things are so, some of these men have proceeded to such a degree of temerity, that they even pour contempt upon the martyrs, and vituperate those who are slain on account of the confession of the Lord, and who suffer all things predicted by the Lord, and who in this respect strive to follow the footprints of the Lord's passion, having become martyrs of the suffering One; these we do also enrol with the martyrs themselves.

Quod autem cure Deo bellum gerat Carpocrates, et Epiphanes etiam in eo, qui vulgo jactatur, libro De justilia, patet ex eo quod subjungit his verbis: \"Hinc ut qui ridiculum dixerit, legislatoris hoc verbum audiendum est: `Non concupisces: 'usque ad id, quod magis ridicule dicit: `Res proximi tui.'Ipse enim, qui dedit cupiditatem, ut quae contineret generationem, jubet eam auferre, cum a nullo earn auferat animali. Illud autem: `Uxorein proximi mi, 'quo communionera cogit ad proprietatem, dixit adhuc magis ridicule.\" Et haec quidera dogmata constituunt egregii Carpocratiani.

Xanthus autem in iis, quae scribuntur Magica: \"Coeunt autem,\" inquit, \"magi cum matribus et filiabus: et fas esse aiunt coire cure sororibus, et communes esse uxores, non vi et clam, sed utrisque consentientibus, cure velit alter ducere uxorem alterius.\" De his et similibus haeresibus existimo Judam prophetice dixisse in epistola: \"Similiter quidera hi quoque somniantes\" (non enim vigilantes ad veritatem se applicant), usque ad illud: \"Et os eorum loquitur superba.\"[fn-61-P6179_1889921:14-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":5,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_61_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Ex iis autem, qui ab haeresi ducuntur, Marciohis quidem Pontici fecimus mentionem, qui propter certamen, quod adversus Creatorem suscepit, mundanarum rerum usum recusat.

Quomodo etiam res est libera, intemperantia et turpis sermo? \"Omnis enim, qui peccat, est servus,\" inquit Apostolus.[fn-62-P6247_1905945:24-nf] Sed quomodo vitiam ex Deo instituit, qui seipsum prae buit dedititium cuivis concupiscentiae? cum dixerit Dominus: \"Ego autem dico: Ne concupiscas.\" Vultne autem aliquis sua sponte peccare, et decernere adulteria esse committenda, voluptatibusque et deliciis se explendum, et aliorum violanda matrimonia, cum aliorum etiam, qui inviti peccant, misereamur? Quod si in externum mundum venerint, qui in alieno non fuerint fideles, verum non babebunt. Afficit autem hospes aliquis elves contumelia, et eis injuriam facit; et non potius ut peregrinus, utens necessariis, vivit, cives non offendens? Quomodo autem, cum eadem faciant, ac ii, quos gentes odio habent, quod legibus obtemperare nolint, nempe iniqui, et incontinentes, et avari, et adulteri, dicunt se solos Deum nosse? Oporteret enim eos, cum in alienis adsunt, recte vivere, ut revera regiam indolem ostenderent. Jam vero et humanos legislatores, et divinam legera habent sibi infensam, cum inique et praeter leges vivere instituerint. Is certe, qui scortatorein \"confodit,\" a Deo plus esse ostenditur in Numeris. \"Et si dixerimus,\" inquit Joannes in epistola, \"quod societatem habemus cum eo,\" nempe Deo, \"et in tenebris ambulamus, mentitour, et veritatem non facimus. Si autem in luce ambulamus, sicut et ipse est in luce, societatem habemus cum ipso, et sanguis Jesu filii ejus emundat nos a peccato.\"[fn-62-P6248_1907326:25-nf] Quomodo ergo sunt hi hujus mundi hominibus meliores, qui haec faciunt, et vel pessimis hujus mundi sunt similes? sunt enim, ut arbitror, similes natura, qui sunt factis similes. Quibus autem se esse censent nobilitate superiores, eos debent etiam superare moribus, ut vitent ne includantur in carcere.

Sunt autem etiam, qui matrimonium aperte dicunt fornicationem, et decernunt id traditum esse a diabolo. Dicunt autem gloriosi isti jactatores se imitari Dominum, qui neque uxorem duxit, neque in mundo aliquid possedit; se magis quam alii Evangelium intellexisse gloriantes.

Propterea nec \"tempora\" prae finiit, \"quge Pater posuit in sua potestate,\"[fn-62-P6297_1925953:64-nf] ut permaneret mundus per generationes. Illud autem: \"Non omnes capiunt verbum hoc: sunt enim eunuchi, qui sic nati sunt; et sunt eunuchi, qui castrati sunt ab hominibus; et sunt eunuchi, qui seipsos castrarunt propier regnum coelorum.

Aiunt autem athletas quoque non paucos abstinere a venere, propier exercitationem corporis continentes: quemadmodum Crotoniatem Astylum, et Crisonem Himeraeum. Quinetiam Amoebeus citharoedus, cum recenter matrimonio junctus esset, a sponsa abstinuit: et Cyrenaeus Aristoteles amantem Laidem solus despexit. Cum meretrici itaque jurasset, se eam esse in patriam abducturum, si sibi adversus decertantes advesarios in aliquibus opem tulisset, postquam id perfecisset, lepide a se dictum jusjurandum exsequens, cum curasset imaginem ejus quam simillimam depingi, eam Cyrenae statuit, ut scribit Ister in libro De proprietate certaminum. Quare nec castitas est bonum, nisi fiat propter delectionem Dei. Jam de iis, qui matrimonium abhorrent, dicit beatus Paulus: \"In novissimis diebus deficient quidam a fide, attendentes spiritibus erroris, et doctrinis daemoniorum, prohibentium nubere, abstinere a cibis.\"[fn-63-P6300_1927512:67-nf] Et rursus dicit: \"Nemo vos seducat in voluntaria humilitatis religione, et parcimonia corporis.\"[fn-63-P6301_1927631:68-nf] Idem autem ilia quoque scribit: \"Alligatus es uxori? ne quaeras solutionem. Solutus es ab uxore? ne quaeras uxorem.\"[fn-63-P6302_1927770:69-nf] Et rursus: \"Unusquisque autem suam uxorem habeat, ne tenter vos Satanas.\"[fn-63-P6303_1927865:70-nf] Quid veto? non etiam justi veteres creaturam cum gratiarum actione participabant? Aliqui autem etiam liberos susceperunt, continenter versati in matrimonio. Et Eliae quidem corvi alimentum afferebant, panes et carnes. Quinetiam Samuel propheta armum, quem ex iis, quae comedisset, reliquerat, allatum, dedit edenalum Sauli. Hi autem, qui se cos dicunt vitae institutis excellere, cum illorum actionibus ne poterunt quidem conferri. \"Qui\" itaque \"non comedit, comedentem ne spernat.

Petrus enim et Philippu\"[fn-63-P6306_1928781:73-nf] filios procrearunt: Philippus autem filias quoque suas viris locavit. Et Paulus quidem certe non veretur in quadam epistola suam appellare \"conjugem,\" quam non circumferebat, quod non magno ei esset opus ministerio. Dicit itaque in quadam epistola: \"Non habemus potestatem sororem uxorem circumducendi, sicut et reliqui apostoli? \"[fn-63-P6307_1929137:74-nf] Sed hi quidem, ut erat consentaneum, ministerio, quod divelli non poterat, praedicationi scilicet, attendentes, non ut uxores , sed ut sorores circumducebant mulieres, quae una ministraturae essent apud mulieres quae domos custodiebant: per quas etiam in gynaeceum, absque ulla reprehensione malave suspicione, ingredi posset doctrina Domini. Scimus enim quae cunque de feminis diaconis in altera ad Timotheum praestantissimus[fn-63-P6308_1929584:75-nf] docet Paulus.

Non enim facile multiplicatur genus, cum viii quidera seminant, legitimo juncti matrimonio; exspectant autem non solum uteri gestationem, sed etiam a lacte depulsionem.

Unde etiam Panlus quoque verba dirigens ad eos, qu ierant iis, qui dicti sunt, similes: \"Has ergo promissiones habete, inquit, dilecti: mundemus corda nostra ab omni inquinamento carnis et spiritus, perficientes sanctitatem in timore Dei.[fn-63-P6368_1949166:119-nf] Zelo enim vos zelo Dei; despondi enim vos uni viro, virginem castam exhibere Christo.\"[fn-63-P6369_1949283:120-nf] Et Ecclesia quidem alii non jungitur matrimonio, cum sponsum hubeat: sed unusquisque nostrum habet potestatem ducendi, quamcunque velit, legitimam uxorem, in prim is, inquam, nuptiis. \"Vereor autem, ne sicut serpens seduxit Evam in astutia, corrumpantur sensus vestri a simplicitate, quae in Christo est,\"[fn-63-P6370_1949610:121-nf] pie admodum et doctoris instar dixit Apostolus.

Illud enim: \"Non concupisces,\" quod scriptum est in Evangelio, legi attribuit in Epistola ad Romanos, sciens esse unum eum, qui praedicavit per legem et prophetas, Patrem, et qui per ipsum est annuntiatus.

And the husbandmen took his servants: they cut one to pieces, stoned another, and killed another. Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. But last of all he sent unto them his only son, saying, Perchance they will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and we shall possess his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When, therefore, the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto these husbandmen? They say unto him, He will miserably destroy these wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their season.\"[fn-87-P8764_2485992:558-nf] Again does the Lord say: \"Have ye never read, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the comer: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

Go out therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, gather in to the marriage. So the servants went out, and collected together as many as they found, bad and good, and the wedding was furnished with guests. But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man not having on a wedding garment; and he said unto him, Friend, how camest thou hither, not having on a wedding garment?

He accordingly sent forth His armies and destroyed them, and burned down their city; but He called together from all the highways, that is, from all nations, [guests] to the marriage feast of His Son, as also He says by Jeremiah: \"I have sent also unto you my servants the prophets to say, Return ye now, every man, from his very evil way, and amend your doings.\"[fn-87-P8788_2497863:578-nf] And again He says by the same prophet: \"I have also sent unto you my servants the prophets throughout the day and before the light; yet they did not obey me, nor incline their ears unto me.

He has acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as His own blood, from which He bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of the creation) He has established as His own body, from which He gives increase to our bodies.[fn-89-P8926_2557098:13-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4. If, however, we must speak strictly, [we would say that] the flesh does not inherit, but is inherited; as also the Lord declares, \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the earth by inheritance; \"[fn-90-P9010_2595571:63-nf] as if in the [future] kingdom, the earth, from whence exists the substance Of our flesh, is to be possessed by inheritance. This is the reason for His wishing the temple (i.e., the flesh) to be clean, that the Spirit of God may take delight therein, as a bridegroom with a bride. As, therefore, the bride cannot [be said] to wed, but to be wedded, when the bridegroom comes and takes her, so also the flesh cannot by itself possess the kingdom of God by inheritance; but it can be taken for an inheritance into the kingdom of God. For a living person inherits the goods of the deceased; and it is one thing to inherit, another to be inherited. The former rules, and exercises power over, and orders the things inherited at his will; but the latter things are in a state of subjection, are under order, and are ruled over by him who has obtained the inheritance. What, therefore, is it that lives? The Spirit of God, doubtless. What, again, are the possessions of the deceased? The various parts of the man, surely, which rot in the earth. But these are inherited by the Spirit when they are translated into the kingdom of heaven. For this cause, too, did Christ die. that the Gospel covenant being manifested and known to the whole world, might in the first place set free His slaves; and then afterwards, as I have already shown, might constitute them heirs of His property, when the Spirit possesses them by inheritance. For he who lives inherits, but the flesh is inherited. In order that we may not lose life by losing that Spirit which possesses us, the apostle, exhorting us to the communion of the Spirit, has said, according to reason, in those words already quoted, \"That flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\" Just as if he were to say, \"Do not err; for unless the Word of God dwell with, and the Spirit of the Father be in you, and if ye shall live frivolously and carelessly as if ye were this only, viz., mere flesh and blood, ye cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\" ","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"149","folder":"ANF-01","text":"1.

And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord.

For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":5,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness.

They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time.

But God does nothing absurd. \"For this God,\" it is said, \"is our God, and there is none to save besides Him.\"[fn-71-P7130_2179469:255-nf] \"For there is no unrighteousness with God,\"[fn-71-P7131_2179535:256-nf] according to the apostle. And clearly yet the prophet teaches the will of God, and the gnostic proficiency, in these words: \"And now, Israel, what doth the Lord God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and walk in all His ways, and love Him, and serve Him alone? \"[fn-71-P7132_2179830:257-nf] He asks of thee, who hast the power of choosing salvation. What is it, then, that the Pythagoreans mean when they bid us \"pray with the voice\"? As seems to me, not that they thought the Divinity could not hear those who speak silently, but because they wished prayers tO be right, which no one would be ashamed to make in the knowledge of many. We shall, however, treat of prayer in due course by and by. But we ought to have works that cry aloud, as becoming \"those who walk in the day.\"[fn-71-P7133_2180338:258-nf] \"Let thy works shine,\"[fn-71-P7134_2180383:259-nf] and behold a man and his works before his face. \"For behold God and His works.\"[fn-71-P7135_2180483:260-nf] For the gnostic must, as far as is possible, imitate God.

And now, to speak about each kind offault separately: of gluttony there are three sorts: (I) that which drives a monk to eatbefore the proper and stated times; (2) that which cares about filling the belly and gorging it with all kinds of food, and (3) that which is on the lookout for dainties anddelicacies. And these three sorts give a monk no little trouble, unless he tries to free himself from all of them with the same care and scrupulousness. For just as one should never venture to break one's fast before the right time so we must utterly avoid all greediness in eating, and the choice and dainty preparation of our food: for from these three causes different but extremely dangerous conditions of the soul arise. For from the first there springs up dislike of the monastery, and thence there grows up disgust and intoleranceof the life there, and this is sure to be soonfollowed by withdrawal and speedy departure from it. By the second there are kindled the fiery darts of luxury and lasciviousness. The third also weaves the entangling meshes of covetousness for the nets of its prisoners, and ever hinders monks from following the perfect self-abnegation of Christ. And when there are traces of this passion in us we can recognize them by this; viz., if we are kept to dine by one of the brethren we are not content to eat our food with the relish which he has prepared and offers to us, but take the unpar- donable liberty of asking to have something else poured. over it or added to it, a thing which we should never do for three reasons: (I) because the monastic mind ought always to be accustomed to practise endurance and abstinence, and like the Apostle, to learn to be content in whatever state he is.[fn-41-P4146_1532088:18-nf] For one who is upset by taking an unsavoury morsel once and in a way, and who cannot even for a short time overcome the delicacy of his appetite will never succeed in curbing the secret and more important desires of the body; (2) because it sometimes happens that at the time our host is out of that particular thing which we ask for, and we make him feel ashamed of the wants and bareness of his table, by exposing his poverty which he would rather was only known to God; (3) because sometimes other people do not care about the relish which we ask for, and so it turns out that we are annoying most of them while intent on satisfying the desires of our own palate. And on this account we must by all means avoid such a liberty. Of fornication there are three sorts: (I) that which is accomplished by sexual intercourse; (2) that which takes place without touching a woman, for which we read that Onan the son of the patriarch Judah was smitten by the Lord; and which is termed by Scripture uncleanness: of which the Apostle says: \"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, that it is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they do not contain let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn;\"[fn-41-P4147_1533320:19-nf] (3) that which is conceived in heart and mind, of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\"[fn-41-P4148_1533532:20-nf] And these three kinds the blessed Apostle tells us must be stamped out in one and the same way. \"Mortify,\" says he, \"your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, etc.\"[fn-41-P4149_1533747:21-nf] And again of two of them he says to the Ephesians: \"Let fornication and uncleanness be not so much as named among you:\" and once more: \"But know this that no fornicator or unclean person, or covetous person who is an idolater hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\"[fn-41-P4150_1534046:22-nf] And just as these three must be avoided by us with equal care, go they one and all shut us out and exclude us equally from the kingdom of Christ. Of covetousness there are three kinds: (I) That which hinders renunciants from allowing themselves of be stripped of their goods and property; (2) that which draws us to resume with excessive eagerness the possession of those things which we have given away and distributed to the poor; (3) that which leads a man to covet and procure what he never previously possessed. Of anger there are three kinds: one which rages within, which is called in Greek qumo/j; another which breaks out in word and deed and action, which they term o0rgh/: of which the Apostle speaks, saying \"But now do ye lay aside all anger and indignation;\"[fn-41-P4151_1534837:23-nf] the third, which is not like those in boiling over and being done with in an hour, but which lasts for days and long periods, which is called mh=nij. And all these three must be condemned by us with equal horror. Of deflection there are two kinds: one, that which springs up when anger has died down, or is the result of some loss we have incurred or of some purpose which has been hindered and interfered with; the other, that which comes from unreasonable anxiety of mind or from despair. Of accidie there are two kinds: one of which sends those affected by it to sleep; while the other makes them forsake their cell and flee away. Of vainglory, although it takes various forms and shapes, and is divided into different classes, yet there are two main kinds: (I) when we are puffed up about carnal things and things visible, and (2) when we are inflamed with the desire of vain praise for things spiritual and unseen.","title":"V.

But if you are not suffering persecution, why are you unwilling to reply to us? Or if the fact be that you are afraid lest, when you should have made reply, you then should suffer persecution, in that case how are you following the example of those preachers to whom it was said, \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves?\" To whom it was also further said \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.\"[fn-48-P4864_2389682:64-nf] And how do you escape the charge of acting contrary to the injunction of the Apostle Peter, who says, \"Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the faith and hope that is in you?\"[fn-48-P4865_2389918:65-nf] And, lastly, wherefore are you ever eager to annoy thee Catholic Churches by the most violent disturbances, whenever it is in your power, as is proved by innumerable instances of simple fact?

And yet not even on account of those Pharisees, with whom you compare us,-not from any motives of prudence, but from malice,-did our Lord enjoin that the seat of Moses should be deserted, which seat He doubtless meant to be a figure of His own; for He said indeed that they who sat in Moses' seat were ever saying and not doing, but warns the people to do what they say, and not to do what they do,[fn-51-P5163_2515520:189-nf] lest the chair, with all its holiness, should be deserted, and the unity of the flock divided through the faithlessness of the shepherds.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":67,"source_paragraph":"324","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"153.

Now we know that neither things which are clear are made subjects of investigation, such as if it is day, while it is day; nor things unknown, and never destined to become clear, as whether the stars are even or odd in number; nor things convertible; and those are so which can be said equally by those who take the opposite side, as if what is in the womb is a living creature or not. A fourth mode is, when, from either side of those, there is advanced an unanswerable and irrefragable argument. If, then, the ground of inquiry, according to all of these modes, is removed, faith is established. For we advance to them the unanswerable consideration, that it is God who speaks and comes to our help in writing, respecting each one of the points regarding which I investigate. Who, then, is so impious as to disbelieve God, and to demand proofs from God as from men? Again, some questions demand the evidence of the senses,[fn-72-P7212_2196612:14-nf] as if one were to ask whether the fire be warm, or the snow white; and some admonition and rebuke, as the question if you ought to honour your parents. And there are those that deserve punishment, as to ask proofs of the existence of Providence. There being then a Providence, it were impious to think that the whole of prophecy and the economy in reference to a Saviour did not take place in accordance with Providence. And perchance one should not even attempt to demonstrate such points, the divine Providence being evident from the sight of all its skilful and wise works which. are seen, some of which take place in order, and some appear in order. And He who communicated to us being and life, has communicated to us also reason, wishing us to live rationally and rightly. For the Word of the Father of the universe is not the uttered word (lo/goj proforiko/j), but the wisdom and most manifest kindness of God, and His power too, which is almighty and truly divine, and not incapable of being conceived by those who do not confes\"-the all-potent will. But since some are unbelieving, and some are disputations, all do not attain to the perfection of the good. For neither is it possible to attain it without the exercise of free choice; nor does the whole depend on our own purpose; as, for example, what is defined to happen.\"For by grace we are saved: \"not, indeed, without good works; but we must, by being formed for what is good, acquire an inclination for it. And we must possess the healthy mind which is fixed on the pursuit of the good; in order to which we have the greatest need of divine grace, and of right teaching, and of holy susceptibility, and of the drawing of the Father to Him. For, bound in this earthly body, we apprehend the objects of sense by means of the body; but we grasp intellectual objects by means of the logical faculty itself. But if one expect to apprehend all things by the senses, he has fallen far from the truth. Spiritually, therefore, the apostle writes respecting the knowledge of God, \"For now we see as through a glass, but then face to face.\"[fn-72-P7213_2198788:15-nf] For the vision of the truth is given but to few. Accordingly, Plato says in the Epinomis, \"I do not say that it is possible for all to be blessed and happy; only a few. Whilst we live, I pronounce this to be the case. But there is a good hope that after death I shall attain all.\" To the same effect is what we find in Moses: \"No man shall see My face, and live.\"[fn-72-P7214_2199174:16-nf] For it is evident that no one during the period of life has been able to apprehend God clearly. But\" the pure in heart shall see God,\"[fn-72-P7215_2199330:17-nf] when they arrive at the final perfection. For since the soul became too enfeebled for the apprehension of realities, we needed a divine teacher. The Saviour is sent down-a teacher and leader in the acquisition of the good-the secret and sacred token of the great Providence. \"Where, then, is the scribe? where is the searcher of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? \"[fn-72-P7216_2199742:18-nf] it is said. And again, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent,\"[fn-72-P7217_2199880:19-nf] plainly of those wise in their own eyes, and disputatious. Excellently therefore Jeremiah says, \"Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and ask for the eternal paths,\"what is the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find expiation for your souls.\"[fn-72-P7218_2200150:20-nf] Ask, he says, and inquire of those who know, without contention and dispute. And on learning the way of truth, let us walk on the right way, without turning till we attain to what we desire: It was therefore with reason that the king of the Romans (his name was Numa), being a Pythagorean, first of all men, erected a temple to Faith and Peace. \"And to Abraham, on believing, righteousness was reckoned.\"[fn-72-P7219_2200573:21-nf] He, prosecuting the lofty philosophy of aerial phenomena, and the sublime philosophy of the movements in the heavens, was called Abram, which is interpreted \"sublime father.\"[fn-72-P7220_2200775:22-nf] But afterwards, on looking up to heaven, whether it was that he saw the Son in the spirit, as some explain, or a glorious angel, or in any other way recognised God to be superior to the creation, and all the order in it, he receives in addition the Alpha, the knowledge of the one and only God, and is called Abraam, having, instead of a natural philosopher, become wise, and a lover of God. For it is interpreted, \"elect father of sound.\" For by sound is the uttered word: the mind is its father; and the mind of the good man is elect.

And we indeed, dear brethren, when we hear false charges brought against us by those whom we have offended by preaching the eloquence of truth, and confuting the vanity of error, have, as you know, the most abundant consolation. For if, in the matters which they lay to my charge, the testimony of my conscience does not stand against me in the sight of God, where no mortal eye can reach, not only ought I not to be cast down, but I should even rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is my reward in heaven.[fn-55-P5584_2694250:31-nf] For in fact I ought to consider, not how bitter, but how false is what I hear, and how true He is in defense of whose name I am exposed to it, and to whom it is said, \"Thy name is as ointment poured forth.\"[fn-55-P5585_2694475:32-nf] And deservedly does it smell sweet in all nations, though those who speak evil of us endeavor to confine its fragrance within one corner of Africa.

Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.\" What He says in the first instance, \"for righteousness' sake,\" He has repeated in the words that He uses afterwards, \"for my sake;\" seeing that He \"is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-55-P5590_2695806:34-nf] And when He says, \"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven,\"[fn-55-P5591_2695917:35-nf] if I hold in a good conscience what is said \"for righteousness' sake,\" and \"for my sake,\" whosoever willfully detracts from my reputation is against his will contributing to my reward.

Follow the faith of the holy Scriptures, and you will find that Christ rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the Father. Follow the charges brought by His enemies, and you will presently believe that He was stolen from the sepulchre by His disciples. Why then should we, while defending His house to the best of the abilities given us by God, expect to meet with any other treatment from His enemies? \"If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of His household?\"[fn-55-P5592_2696759:36-nf] If, therefore, we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.

Therefore the teacher of the Gentiles, that was superior in excellence to the majority, was sent to preach the gospel, not to baptize; because the latter could be done by many, the former only by a few, of whom he was chief.

But since this had been, as we have said, utterly corrupted by freedom and the opportunity of sinning, the severe restrictions of the law of Moses were added as the executor and vindicator of this (earlier law) and to use the expressions of Scripture, as its helper, that through fear of immediate punishment men might be kept from altogether losing the good of natural knowledge, according to the word of the prophet who says \"He gave the law to help them:\"[fn-47-P4749_1726831:43-nf] and it is also described by the Apostle as having been given as a schoolmaster[fn-47-P4750_1726927:44-nf] to little children, as it instructs and guards them to prevent them from departing through sheer forgetfulness from the teaching in which they had been instructed by the light of nature: for that the complete knowledge of the law was implanted in man at his first creation, is clearly proved from this; viz., that we know that before the law, aye, and even before the flood, all holy men observed the commands of the law without having the letter to read. For how could Abel, without the command of the law, have known that he ought to offer to God a sacrifice of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof,[fn-47-P4751_1727576:45-nf] unless he had been taught by the law which was naturally implanted in him? How could Noah have distinguished what animals were clean and what were unclean,[fn-47-P4752_1727755:46-nf] when the commandment of the law had not yet made a distinction, unless he had been taught by a natural knowledge? Whence did Enoch learn how to \"walk with God,\"[fn-47-P4753_1727962:47-nf] having never acquired any light of the law from another? Where had Shem and Japheth read \"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father,\" so that they went backwards and covered the shame of their father?[fn-47-P4754_1728190:48-nf] How was Abraham taught to abstain from the spoils of the enemy which were offered to him, that he might not receive any recompense for his toil, or to pay to the priest Melchizedec the tithes which are ordered by the law of Moses?[fn-47-P4755_1728442:49-nf] How was it too that the same Abraham and Lot also humbly offered to passers by and strangers offices of kindness and the washing of their feet, while yet the Evangelic command had not shone forth?[fn-47-P4756_1728667:50-nf] Whence did Job obtain such earnestness of faith, such purity of chastity, such knowledge of humility, gentleness, pity and kindness, as we now see shown not even by those who know the gospels by heart? Which of the saints do we read of as not having observed some commandment of the law before the giving of the law? Which of them failed to keep this: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord?\"[fn-47-P4757_1729086:51-nf] Which of them did not fulfil this: \"Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of anything which is in heaven or in the earth or under the earth?\" Which of them did not observe this: \"Honour thy father and thy mother,\" or what follows in the Decalogue: \"Thou shalt do no murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife,\"[fn-47-P4758_1729542:52-nf] and many other things besides, in which they anticipated the commands not only of the law but even of the gospel?","title":"VIII.

But true martyrs are such as those of whom the Lord says. \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake.\"[fn-59-P5909_2856912:21-nf] It is not, therefore, those who suffer persecution for their unrighteousness, and for the divisions which they impiously introduce into Christian unity, but those who suffer for righteousness' sake, that are truly martyrs. For Hagar also suffered persecution at the hands of Sarah;[fn-59-P5910_2857210:22-nf] and in that case she who persecuted was righteous, and she unrighteous who suffered persecution. Are we to compare with this persecution which Hagar suffered the case of holy David, who was persecuted by unrighteous Saul?[fn-59-P5911_2857450:23-nf] Surely there is in essential difference, not in respect of his suffering, but because he suffered for righteousness' sake. And the Lord Himself was crucified with two thieves;[fn-59-P5912_2857657:24-nf] but those who were joined in their suffering were separated by the difference of its cause. Accordingly, in the psalm, we must interpret of the true martyrs, who wish to be distinguished from false martyrs, the verse in which it is said, \"Judge me, O Lord, and distinguish[fn-59-P5913_2857951:25-nf] my cause from an ungodly nation.\"[fn-59-P5914_2858076:26-nf] He does not say, Distinguish my punishment, but \"Distinguish my cause.\" For the punishment of the impious may be the same; but the cause of the martyrs is always different.

And that we ought earnestly to seek after this condition the formula of the Lord's prayer teaches us, saying \"Our Father.\" When then we confess with our own mouths that the God and Lord of the universe is our Father, we profess forthwith that we have been called from our condition as slaves to the adoption of sons, adding next \"Which art in heaven,\" that, by shunning with the utmost horror all lingering in this present life, which we pass upon this earth as a pilgrimage, and what separates us by a great distance from our Father, we may the rather hasten with all eagerness to that country where we confess that our Father dwells, and may not allow anything of this kind, which would make us unworthy of this our profession and the dignity of an adoption of this kind, and so deprive us as a disgrace to our Father's inheritance, and make us incur the wrath of His justice and severity. To which state and condition of sonship when we have advanced, we shall forthwith be inflamed with the piety which belongs to good sons, so that we shall bend all our energies to the advance not of our own profit, but of our Father's glory, saying to Him: \"Hallowed be Thy name,\" testifying that our desire and our joy is His glory, becoming imitators of Him who said: \"He who speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory. But He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, the same is true and there is no unrighteousness in Him.\"[fn-48-P4882_1768795:24-nf] Finally the chosen vessel being filled with this feeling wished that he could be anathema from Christ[fn-48-P4883_1768923:25-nf] if only the people belonging to Him might be increased and multiplied, and the salvation of the whole nation of Israel accrue to the glory of His Father; for with all assurance could he wish to die for Christ as he knew that no one perished for life. And again he says: \"We rejoice when we are weak but ye are strong.\"[fn-48-P4884_1769263:26-nf] And what wonder if the chosen vessel wished to be anathema from Christ for the sake of Christ's glory and the conversion of His own brethren and the privilege of the nation, when the prophet Micah wished that he might be a liar and a stranger to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, if only the people of the Jews might escape those plagues and the going forth into captivity which he had announced in his prophecy, saying: \"Would that I were not a man that hath the Spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie;\"[fn-48-P4885_1769791:27-nf] -to pass over that wish of the Lawgiver, who did not refuse to die together with his brethren who were doomed to death, saying: \"I beseech Thee, O Lord; this people hath sinned a heinous sin; either forgive them this trespass, or if Thou do not, blot me out of Thy book which Thou hast written.\"[fn-48-P4886_1770106:28-nf] But where it is said \"Hallowed be Thy name,\" it may also be very fairly taken in this way: \"The hallowing of God is our perfection.\" And so when we say to Him\" Hallowed be Thy name\" we say in other words, make us, O Father, such that we maybe able both to understand and take in what the hallowing of Thee is, or at any rite that Thou mayest be seen to be hallowed in our spiritual converse.

We also ought forthwith to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble grace of love we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all that the father has is its own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the true son: \"All that the Father hath is mine.\"[fn-51-P5151_1861929:15-nf] Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying: \"All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.\"[fn-51-P5152_1862151:16-nf] And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also summon us: \"Be ye,\" says He, \"perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect\"[fn-51-P5153_1862307:17-nf] For in these persons sometimes the love of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the soul is relaxed by some coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the fear of hell for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so that when from fear of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to avoid sin we are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for \"fear,\" says one, \"is not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment, but he who fears is not perfect in love. We therefore love because God first loved us.\"[fn-51-P5154_1862964:18-nf] We can then only ascend to that true perfection when, as He first loved us for the grace of nothing but our salvation, we also have loved Him for the sake of nothing but His own love alone. Wherefore we must do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from this fear to hope, from hope to the love of God, and the love of the virtues themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love of goodness itself, we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm hold of what is good.","title":"XI.

Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: \"A son knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?\"[fn-51-P5163_1867256:19-nf] For one who is a servant must needs fear because \"if knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-51-P5164_1867426:20-nf] Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: \"Thou hast broken my chains.

Again, what eyes did He look for when He spake to those who saw indeed, but who saw only with the eyes of the flesh? For when Philip said to Him, \"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;\"[fn-46-P4681_2004302:8-nf] he understood indeed that if the Father were shown him, it might well suffice him; but how would the Father suffice him whom He that was equal to the Father sufficed not? And why did He not suffice? Because He was not seen. And why was He not seen? Because the eye whereby He might be seen was not yet whole. For this, namely, that the Lord was seen in the flesh with the outward eyes, not only the disciples who honoured Him saw, but also the Jews who crucified Him. He then who wished to be seen in another way, sought for other eyes. And therefore it was that to him who said, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;\" He answered, \"Have I been so long time with you; and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also.\"[fn-46-P4682_2005080:9-nf] And that He might in the mean while heal the eyes of faith, he has first of all instructions given him regarding faith, that so he might attain to sight. And lest Philip should think that he was to conceive of God under the same form in which he then saw the Lord Jesus Christ in the body, he immediately subjoined; \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?\"[fn-46-P4683_2005481:10-nf] He had already said, \"He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also.\" But Philip's eye was not yet sound enough to see the Father, nor consequently to see the Son who is Himself Coequal with the Father. And so Jesus Christ took in hand to cure, and with the medicines and salve of faith to strengthen the eyes of his mind, which as yet were weak and unable to behold so great a light, and He said, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?\" Let not him then who cannot yet see what the Lord will one day show him, seek first to see what he is to believe; but let him first believe that the eye by which he is to see may be healed. For it was only the form of the servant which was exhibited to the eyes of servants; because if \"He who thought it not robbery to be equal with God,\"[fn-46-P4684_2006307:11-nf] could have been now seen as equal with God by those whom He wished to be healed, He would not have needed to \"empty Himself, and to take the form of a servant.\" But because there was no way whereby God could be seen, but whereby man could be seen, there was; therefore He who was God was made man, that that which was seen might heal that whereby He was not seen. For He saith Himself in another place, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-46-P4685_2006785:12-nf] Philip might of course have answered and said, \"Lord, lo, I see Thee; is the Father such as I see Thee to be? forasmuch as Thou hast said, `He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also'?\" But before Philip answered thus, or perhaps before he so much as thought it, when the Lord had said, \"He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also;\" He immediately added, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?\" For with that eye he could, not yet see either the Father, or the Son who isequal with the Father; but that his eye might be healed for seeing, he was to be anointed unto believing. So then before thou seest what thou canst not now see, believe what as yet thou seest not. \"Walk by faith,\" that thou mayest attain to sight. Sight will not gladden him in his home whom faith consoleth not by the way. For so says the Apostle, \"As long as we are in the body, we are in pilgrimage from the Lord.\"[fn-46-P4686_2007727:13-nf] And he subjoins immediately why we are still \"in pilgrimage,\" though we have now believed; \"For we walk by faith,\" He says, \"not by sight.\"","title":"Sermon XXXVIII.

Because it is life in itself. \"And hath given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man.\" What judgment, what kind of judgment? \"Marvel not at this\" which I have said,-gave Him authority to execute judgment,-\"for the hour is coming.\" He does not adds \"and now is:\" therefore He means to make known to us a certain hour in the end of the world.

In that He will not be seen in the judgment. \"They shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-10-P1022_609438:12-nf] That form which stood before the judge, will be Judge: that form will judge which was judged; for it was judged unjustly, it will judge justly.

For in one way we love our parents, in another our wives, in another our brothers, in another our children, and there is a wide difference in regard to the claims of these feelings of affection, nor is the love of parents towards their children always equal. As is shown by the case of the patriarch Jacob, who, though he was the father of twelve sons and loved them all with a father's love, yet loved Joseph with deeper affection, as Scripture clearly shows: \"But his brethren envied him, because his father loved him;\"[fn-57-P5740_2040288:22-nf] evidently not that that good man his father failed in greatly loving the rest of his children, but that in his affection he clung to this one, because he was a type of the Lord, more tenderly and indulgently. This also, we read, was very clearly shown in the case of John the Evangelist, where these words are used of him: \"that disciple whom Jesus loved,\"[fn-57-P5741_2040666:23-nf] though certainly He embraced all the other eleven, whom He had chosen in the same way, with His special love, as this He shows also by the witness of the gospel, where He says: \"As I have loved you, so do ye also love one another;\" of whom elsewhere also it is said: \"Loving His own who were in the world, He loved them even to the end.\"[fn-57-P5742_2041027:24-nf] But this love of one in particular did not indicate any coldness in love for the rest of the disciples, but only a fuller and more abundant love towards the one, which his prerogative of virginity and the purity of his flesh bestowed upon him. And therefore it is marked by exceptional treatment, as being something more sublime, because no hateful comparison with others, but a richer grace of superabundant love singled it out. Some-thing of this sort too we have in the character of the bride in the Song of Songs, where she says: \"Set in order love in me.\"[fn-57-P5743_2041609:25-nf] For this is true love set in order, which, while it hates no one, yet loves some still more by reason of their deserving it, and which, while it loves all in general, singles out for itself some from those, whom it may embrace with a special affection, and again among those, who are the special and chief objects of its love, singles out some who are preferred to others in affection.","title":"XVI.

For, indeed, all men are lamps, since they can be both lighted and extinguished. Moreover, when the lamps are wise, they shine and glow with the Spirit; yet also, if they did burn and are put out, they even stink. The servants of God remain good lamps by the oil of His mercy, not by their own strength. The free grace of God, truly, is the oil of the lamps. \"For I have labored more than they all,\" saith a certain lamp; and lest he should seem to burn by his own strength, he added, \"But not I, but the grace of God that was with me.\"[fn-11-P1166_715078:4-nf] All prophecy, therefore, before the coming of the Lord, is a lamp. Of this lamp the Apostle Peter says: \"We have a more sure word of prophecy, to which ye do well giving heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts.\"[fn-11-P1167_715372:5-nf] Accordingly the prophets are lamps, and all prophecy one great lamp. What of the apostles? Are not they, too, lamps? They are, clearly. He alone is not a lamp. For He is not lighted and put out; because \"even as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself.\" The apostles also, I say, are lamps; and they give thanks because they were both lighted by the light of truth, and are burning with the spirit of charity, and supplied with the oil of God's grace. If they were not lamps, the Lord would not say to them, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" For after He said, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" He shows that they should not think themselves such a light as that of which it is said, \"That was the true light, that enlighteneth every man coming into this world.\" But this was said of the Lord at that time when He was distinguished from John (the Baptist). Of John the Baptist, indeed, it had been said, \"He was not the light, but that he might bear witness of the light.\"[fn-11-P1168_716405:6-nf] And lest thou shouldst say, How was he not the light, of whom Christ says that \"he was a lamp\"?-I answer, In comparison of the other light, he was not light. For \"that was the true light that enlighteneth every man coming into this world.\" Accordingly, when He said also to the disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" lest they should imagine that anything was attributedto them which was to be understood of Christ alone, and thus the lamps should be extinguished by the wind of pride, when He had said, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" He immediately subjoined, \"A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid; neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but an a candlestick, that it may shine on all that are in the house.\" But what if He did not call the apostles the candle, but the lighters of the candle, which they were to put on a candlestick? Hear that He called themselves the candle. \"So let your light shine,\" saith He, \"before men, that they, seeing your good works, may glorify,\" not you, but \"your Father who is in heaven.\"[fn-11-P1169_717473:7-nf] ","title":"Tractate XXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_60_sermon_xliii_xciii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"3.

For when we heard of very many and very celebrated monasteries rounded by the ancient fathers, like most eager merchants, at once we undertook the journey on an uncertain quest, urged on by the hope of greater gain.And when we wandered about there for some long time and fixed our curious eyes on thosemountains of virtue conspicuous for their lofty height, the gaze of those around first singled out Abbot Piamun, the senior of all the anchorites living there and their presbyter, as if he were some tall lighthouse. For he was set on the top of a high mountain like that city in the gospel,[fn-60-P6031_2136387:3-nf] and at once shed his light on our faces, whose virtues and miracles, which were wrought by him under our very eyes, Divine Grace thus bearing witness to his excellence, if we are not to exceed the plan and limits of this volume, we feel we must pass over in silence. For we promised to commit to memory what we could recollect, not of the miracles of God, but of the institutes and pursuits of the saints, so as to supply our readers merely with necessary instruction for the perfect life, and not with matter for idle and useless admiration without any correction of their faults. And so when Abbot Piamun had received us with welcome, and had refreshed us with becoming kindness, as he understood that we were not of the same country, he first asked us anxiously whence or why we had visited Egypt, and when he discovered that we had come thither from a monastery in Syria out of desire for perfection he began as follows: -","title":"XVIII.

When our Lord Jesus Christ, as we have heard in the Gospel when it was read, had said that He was Himself the bread which came down from heaven, the Jews murmured and said, \"Is not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?\" These Jews were far off from the bread of heaven, and knew not how to hunger after it. They had the jaws of their heart languid; with open ears they were deaf, they saw and stood blind. This bread, indeed, requires the hunger of the inner man: and hence He saith in another place, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.\"[fn-12-P1263_797648:1-nf] But the Apostle Paul says that Christ is for us righteousness.[fn-12-P1264_797726:2-nf] And, consequently, he that hungers after this bread, hungers after righteousness,-that righteousness however which cometh down from heaven, the righteousness that God gives, not that which man works for himself. For if man were not making a righteousness for himself, the same apostle would not have said of the Jews: \"For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, they are not subject to the righteousness of God.\"[fn-12-P1265_798212:3-nf] Of such were these who understood not the bread that cometh down from heaven; because being satisfied with their own righteousness, they hungered not after the righteousness of God. What is this, God's righteousness and man's righteousness? God's righteousness here means, not that wherein God is righteous, but that which God bestows on man, that man may be righteous through God. But again, what was the righteousness of those Jews? A righteousness wrought of their own strength on which they presumed, and so declared themselves as if they were fulfillers of the law by their own virtue. But no man fulfills the law but he whom grace assists, that is, whom the bread that cometh down from heaven assists. \"For the fulfilling of the law,\" as the apostle says in brief, \"is charity.\"[fn-12-P1266_799011:4-nf] Charity, that is, love, not of money, but of God; love, not of earth nor of heaven, but of Him who made Heaven and earth. Whence can man have that love? Let us hear the same: \"The love of God,\" saith he, \"is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.\"[fn-12-P1267_799307:5-nf] Wherefore, the Lord, about to give the Holy Spirit, said that Himself was the bread that came down from heaven, exhorting us to believe on Him. For to believe on Him is to eat the living bread. He that believes eats; he is sated invisibly, because invisibly is he born again. A babe within, a new man within.

Whence the apostle says, \"For all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-13-P1366_864491:17-nf] that is, they are fulfilled in Him. Again he says in another place, \"All happened to them in a figure; but they were written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages is come.\"[fn-13-P1367_864690:18-nf] And he said elsewhere, \"For Christ is the end of the law;\"[fn-13-P1368_864767:19-nf] likewise in another place, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of a new moon, or of Sabbath-days, which is a shadow of things to come.\"[fn-13-P1369_864960:20-nf] If, therefore, all these things were shadows of things to come, also the feast of tabernacles was a shadow of things to come. Let us examine, then, of what thing to come was this feast-day a shadow. I have explained what this feast of tabernacles was: it was a celebration of tabernacles, because the people, after their deliverance from Egypt, while directing their course through the wilderness to the land of promise, dwelt in tents. Let us observe what it is, and we shall be that thing; we, I say, who are members of Christ, if such we are; but we are, He having made us worthy, not we having earned it for ourselves. Let us then consider ourselves, brethren: we have been led out of Egypt, where we were slaves to the devil as to Pharaoh; where we applied ourselves to works of clay, engaged in earthly desires, and where we toiled exceedingly. And to us, while laboring, as it were, at the bricks, Christ cried aloud, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.\" Thence we were led out by baptism as through the Red Sea.-red because consecrated by the blood of Christ. All our enemies that pursued us being dead, that is, all our sins being blotted out, we have been brought over to the other side. At the present time, then, before we come to the land of promise, namely, the eternal kingdom, we are in the wilderness in tabernacles. They who acknowledge these things are in tabernacles; for it was to be that some would acknowledge this. For that man, who understands that he is a sojourner in this world, is in tabernacles. That man understands that he is travelling in a foreign country, when he sees himself sighing for his native land. But whilst the body of Christ is in tabernacles, Christ is in tabernacles; but at that time He was so, not evidently but secretly. For as yet the shadow obscured the light; when the light came, the shadow was removed. Christ was in secret: He was in the feast of tabernacles, but there hidden. At the present time, when these things are already made manifest, we acknowledge that we are journeying in the wilderness: for if we know it, we are in the wilderness. What is it to be in the wilderness? In the desert waste. Why in the desert waste? Because in this world, where we thirst in a way in which is no water. But yet, let us thirst that we may be filled. For, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-13-P1370_867398:21-nf] And our thirst is quenched from the rock in the wilderness: for \"the Rock was Christ,\" and it was smitten with a rod that the water might flow. But that it might flow, the rock was smitten twice: because there are two beams of the cross.[fn-13-P1371_867653:22-nf] All these things, then, which were done in a figure, are made manifest to us. And it is not without meaning that it was said of the Lord, \"He went up to the feast-day. but not openly, but as it were in secret.\" For Himself in secret was the thing prefigured, because Christ was hid in that same festal-day; for that very festal-day signified Christ's members that were to sojourn in a foreign land.","title":"Tractate XXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_65_sermon_xlviii_xcviii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5. These three kinds of dead persons, are three kinds of sinners whom even at this day Christ doth raise. For that dead daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was within in the house, she had not yet been carried out from the secresy of its walls into public view. There within was she raised, and restored alive to her parents. But the second was not now indeed in the house, but still not yet in the tomb, he had been carried out of the walls, but not committed to the ground. He who raised the dead maiden who was not yet carried out, raised this dead man who was now carried out, but not yet buried. There remained a third case, that He should raise one who was also buried; and this He did in Lazarus. There are then those who have sin inwardly in the heart, but have it not yet in overt act. A man, for instance, is disturbed by any lust. For the Lord Himself saith, \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\"[fn-51-P5154_2190729:16-nf] He has not yet in body approached her, but in heart he has consented; he has one dead within, he has not yet carried him out. And as it often happens, as we know, as men daily experience in themselves, when they hear the word of God, as it were the Lord saying, \"Arise;\" the consent unto sin is condemned, they breathe again unto saving health and righteousness. The dead man in the house arises, the heart revives in the secret of the thoughts. This resurrection of a dead soul takes place within, in the retirement of the conscience, as it were within the walls of the house. Others after consent proceed to overt act, carrying out the dead as it were, that that which was concealed in secret, may appear in public. Are these now, who have advanced to the outward act, past hope? Was it not said to the young man in the Gospel also, \"I say unto thee, Arise\"? Was he not also restored to his mother? So then he too who has committed the open act, if haply admonished and aroused by the word of truth, he rise again at the Voice of Christ, is restored alive. Go so far he could, perish for ever he could not. But they who by doing what is evil, involve themselves even in evil habit, so that this very habit of evil suffers them not to see that it is evil, become defenders of their evil deeds; are angry when they are found fault with; to such a degree, that the men of Sodom of old said to the righteous man who reproved their abominable design, \"Thou art come to sojourn, not to give laws.\"[fn-51-P5155_2192241:17-nf] So powerful in that place was the habit of abominable filthiness, that profligacy now passed for righteousness, and the hinderer of it was found fault with rather than the doer. Such as these pressed down by a malignant habit, are as it were buried. Yea, what shall I say, Brethren? In such sort buried, as was said of Lazarus, \"By this time he stinketh.\"[fn-51-P5156_2192616:18-nf] That heap placed upon the grave, is this stubborn force of habit, whereby the soul is pressed down, and is not suffered either to rise, or breathe again.","title":"Sermon XLVIII.

For if the expression is used thus, salvation does not depend on external things, whether they be many or few, small or great, or illustrious or obscure, or esteemed or disesteemed; but on the virtue of the soul, on faith, and hope, and love, and brotherliness, and knowledge, and meekness, and humility, and truth, the reward of which is salvation. For it is not on account of comeliness of body that any one shall live, or, on the other hand, perish. But he who uses the body given to him chastely and according to God, shall live; and he that destroys the temple of God shall be destroyed.

But you, if you are inflamed with true and perfect love of our Lord, and follow God, who indeed is love, with entire fervour of spirit, are sure to be resorted to by men, to whatever inaccessible spot you may flee, and, in proportion as the ardour of divine love brings you nearer to God, so will a larger concourse of saintly brethren flock to you.

For when owing to this vain hope each one separates himself from living together with the Elders and has been deprived of all those things that he idly imagined in his heart, he rises as it were from a most profound slumber, and when awake will find nothing of those things of which he had dreamed. And so as he is hampered by larger requirements for this life and inextricable snares, the devil will not even allow him to aspire to those things which he had once promised himself, and as he is liable no longer to those rare and spiritual visits of the brethren which he had formerly avoided, but to daily interruptions from worldly folk, he will never suffer him to return even to the moderate quiet and system of the anchorite's life.","title":"XXIV.

In this world ought we to abstain from all unlawful desires, to have, that is, \"our loins girded;\" and to be fervent and to shine in good works, that is, to have \"our lights burning.\" For the Lord Himself said to His disciples in another place of the Gospel, \"No man lighteth a candle and putteth it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light unto all that are in the house.\"[fn-54-P5497_2329117:5-nf] And to show of what He was speaking, He subjoined and said, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-54-P5498_2329310:6-nf] ","title":"Sermon LVIII.

But consider, I pray you, the great punishment we shall suffer, if we give offence at all. For if in a case where the thing was against law, yet, as they rebuked unseasonably, he forbade their doing it, in order that a brother might not be made to offend and stumble; when we give an offence without having anything to set right even, what treatment shall we deserve? For if not saving others be a crime (and that it is so, he who buried the talent proves), what will be the effect of giving him offence also? But what if he gives himself the offence, you may say, by being weak? Why this is just why thou oughtest to be patient. For if he were strong, then he would not require so much attention. But now, since he is of the feebler sort, he does on this ground need considerable care. Let us then yield him this, and in all respects bear his burdens, as it is not of our own sins only that we shall have to give an account, but for those also wherein we cause others to offend. For if that account, were even by itself hard to pass, when these be added too, how are we to be saved? And let us not suppose, that if we can find accomplices in our sins, that will be an excuse; as this will prove an addition to our punishment. Since the serpent too was punished more than the woman, as was the woman likewise more than the man (1 Tim. ii. 14); and Jezebel also was punished more severely than Ahab, who had seized the vineyard; for it was she that devised the whole matter, and caused the king to offend. (1 Kings xxi. 23, 1 Kings xxi. 25, 1 Kings xxi. 29.) And therefore thou, when thou art the author of destruction to others, wilt suffer more severely[fn-31-P3169_2957565:8-nf] than those who have been subverted by thee. For sinning is not so ruinous as leading others also into the same. Wherefore he speaks of those who \"not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.\" (Rom. i. 32) And so when we see any sinning, let us, so far from thrusting them on, even pull them back from the pit of iniquity, that we may not have to be punished for the ruin of others besides ourselves. And let us be continually in mind of the awful judgment-seat, of the stream of fire, of the chains never to be loosed, of the darkness with no light, the gnashing of teeth, and the venomous worm. \"Ah, but God is merciful!\" Are these then mere words? and was not that rich man punished for despising Lazarus? Are not the foolish[fn-31-P3170_2958437:9-nf] virgins cast out of the Bride-chamber? Do not they who did not feed Him go away into \"the fire prepared for the devil?\" (Matt. xxv. 41.) Will not he that hath soiled garments be \"bound hand and foot\" (ib. xxii. 13), and go to ruin? Will, not he that demanded the hundred pence to be paid, be given over to the tormentors? Is not that said of the adulterers[fn-31-P3171_2958896:10-nf] true, that \"their worm shall not die, nor their fire be quenched?\"[fn-31-P3172_2959073:11-nf] (Mark ix. 43.) Are these but mere threats then? Yea, it is answered. And from what source pray dost thou venture to make such an assertion, and that too when thou passest judgment of thine own opinion? Why, I shall be able to prove the contrary, both from what He said, and from what He did. (See John v. 22.) For if you will not believe by the punishments that are to come, at least believe by those that have happened already. For what have happened, and have come forth into reality, surely are not threats and words. Who then was it that flooded the whole world, and affected that baleful wreck, and the utter destruction of our whole race! Who was it that after this hurled those thunders and lightnings upon the land of Sodom? Who that drowned all Egypt in the sea? Who that consumed the six hundred thousand men in the wilderness? Who that burnt up the synagogue of Abiram? Who that bade the earth open her mouth for the company of Core and Dathan, and swallow them up? Who that carried off the threescore and ten thousand at one sweep in David's time? Shall I mention also those that were punished individually! Cain, who was given up to a continual vengeance? (the son of) Charmi,[fn-31-P3173_2960773:12-nf] who was stoned with his whole family? Or him, that suffered the same thing for gathering sticks on the sabbath? The forty children who were consumed by those beasts, and obtained no pardon even on the score of their age? And if you would see these same things even after the times of grace, just consider what great suffering the Jews had, how the women ate their children, some roasting them, and some consuming them in other ways:[fn-31-P3174_2961293:13-nf] how after being given up to irremediable famine, and wars varied and severe, they threw all previous catastrophes into the shade by the exceeding greatness of their own calamities. For that it was Christ Who did these things unto them, hear Him declaring as much, both by parables, and clearly and explicitly. By parables, as when He says. \"But those that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay them\" (Luke xix. 27); and by that of the vineyard, and that of the marriage. But clearly and explicitly, as when He threatens that they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into the nations, and there shall be upon the earth \"distress of nations with perplexity, at the roaring of the sea and waves;[fn-31-P3175_2962101:14-nf] men's hearts failing them for fear.\" (ib. xxi. 24, 25, 26.) \"And there shall be tribulation, such as there never was, no, nor ever shall be.\" (Matt. xxiv. 21.) And what a punishment Ananias too and Sapphira suffered, for the theft of a few pieces of money, ye all know. Seest thou not the daily calamities also? Or have these too not taken place? Seest thou not now men that are pining with famine? those that suffer elephantiasis, or are maimed in body? those that live in constant poverty, those that suffer countless irreparable evils? Now then will it be reasonable for some to be punished, and some not? For if God be not unjust (and unjust He is not), thou also wilt assuredly suffer punishment, if thou sinnest. But if because He is merciful He doth not punish, then ought not these either to have been punished. But now because of these words of yours, God even here punisheth many, that when ye believe not the words of the threatening, the deeds of vengeance ye may at least believe.","title":"Homily XXV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":5,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_76_sermon_lix_cix_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"2.

There remains still the question, which I now think may meanwhile thus be solved. There is a voice of some kind,-there is, I say, a certain kind of voice of the Shepherd, in respect of which the sheep hear not strangers, and in respect of which those who are not sheep do not hear Christ. What a word is this! \"He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.\"[fn-19-P1950_1216472:21-nf] No one of His own is indifferent to such a voice, a stranger does not hear it: for this reason also does He announce it to the former, that he may abideperseveringly with Himself to the end; butby one who is wanting in such persevering continuance with Him, such a word remainsunheard. One has come to Christ, and hasheard word after word of one kind and another, all of them true, all of them salutary; and among all the rest is also this utterance, \"He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.\" He who has heard this is one of the sheep. But there was, perhaps, some one listening to it, who treated it with dislike, with coldness, and heard it as that of a stranger. If he was predestinated, he strayed for the time, but he was not lost for ever: he returns to hear what he has neglected, to do what he has heard. For if he is one of those who are predestinated, then both his very wandering and his future conversion have been foreknown by God: if he has strayed away, he will return to hear that voice of the Shepherd, and to follow Him who saith, \"He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.\" A good voice, brethren, it is; true and shepherd-like, the very voice of salvation in the tabernacles of the righteous.[fn-19-P1951_1217727:22-nf] For it is easy to hear Christ, easy to praise the gospel, easy to applaud the preacher: but to endure unto the end, is peculiar to the sheep who hear the Shepherd's voice. A temptation befalls thee, endure thou to the end, for the temptation will not endure to the end. And what is that end to which thou shalt endure? Even till thou reachest the end of thy pathway. For as long as thou hearest not Christ, He is thine adversary in the pathway, that is, in this mortal life.

If thou hast been at enmity, agree. If thou hast got the opportunity of coming to an agreement, keep not up the quarrel longer. For thou knowest not when thy way will be ended, and it is known to Him. If thou art a sheep, and if thou endurest to the end, thou shalt be saved: and therefore it is that His own despise not that voice, and strangers hear it not. According to my ability, as He gave me the power, I have either explained to you or gone over with you a subject of great profundity. If any have failed fully to understand, let him retain his piety, and the truth will be revealed: and let not those who have understood vaunt themselves as swifter at the expense of the slower, lest in their vaunting they turn out of the track, and the slower more easily attain the goal.

But mystically it shows that, as life is maintained in individuals by sustenance, and want of sustenance is the token of death; so also ought we to fast from worldly things, that we may die to the world, and after that, by partaking of divine sustenance, live to God. Especially does fasting empty the soul of matter, and make it, along with the body, pure and light for the divine words. Worldly food is, then, the former life and sins; but the divine food is faith, hope, love, patience, knowledge, peace, temperance.

It is but lately we were in such a case. There is a troubling of thy possessions, and thou art not found what thou wast, and dost show that there is one thing in thy mouth to-day, and another in thy mouth yesterday. And I would that thou wouldest only defend thine own even with vehemence;[fn-59-P5983_2534994:34-nf] and not try to usurp with audacity another's; and what is worse, to escape reprehension, maintain that what is another's is thine own. But why need I say more? This I advise, this I say, Brethren, and as a brother advise; God bids, and I admonish because I am admonished. He alarmeth me, who doth not allow me to keep silence. He exacteth of me what He hath given. For He hath given it to be laid out, not to be kept up. And if I should keep it and hide it, He saith to me, \"Thou wicked and slothful servant, wherefore gavest thou not My money to the exchangers, that at My coming I might require it with usury? \"[fn-59-P5984_2535622:35-nf] And what will it profit me that I have lost nothing of that which I received?

He is covetous, He looketh for His own money, He gathereth in His Own image. \"Thou shouldest have given,\" saith He, \"the money to the exchangers, that at My coming I might require it with usury.\" And if by any chance forgetfulness should make me fail of admonishing you, the temptations and tribulations at least which we are suffering, would be an admonition to you. Ye have heard at least the word of God. Blessed be the Lord and His glory. For ye are here gathered together, and are hanging on the word of God's minister.

Therefore I forewarn; therefore I tell you, therefore I do not withhold it, my Brethren, that the time of questioning will come. For the Lord maketh question of the righteous and of the ungodly.

I question thy tongue, God questioneth thy thoughts. For He knoweth how thou dost hear, and He knoweth how to require, Who ordereth me to give.

What doth it profit that the rest is fulfilled, if those are not fulfilled? Hast thou thirty-eight? If thou have not those two, the rest will profit thee nothing. Thou hast two short, without which the rest avail not, if thou have not the two commandments which conduct unto salvation. \"If I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

To these also it was not sufficient that they had withdrawn from the Gospel, that they had taken away from the lapsed the hope of satisfaction and repentance, that they had taken away those involved in frauds or stained with adulteries, or polluted with the deadly contagion of sacrifices, lest they should entreat God, or make confession of their crimes in the Church, from all feeling and fruit of repentance; that they had set up[fn-57-P5762_1789956:50-nf] outside for themselves-outside the Church, and opposed to the Church, a conventicle of their abandoned faction, when there had flowed together a band of creatures with evil consciences, and unwilling to entreat and to satisfy God.

The judges said: We know that a light shines through the whole house, and not in some single part of it; as Jesus also intimates when He says, that \"no man lighting a candle puts it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light unto all that are in the house.\"[fn-34-P3438_921082:179-nf] If, then, God is a light, it must needs be that light (if Jesus is to be credited) shall shine on the whole world, and not on any portions of it merely. And if,[fn-34-P3439_921262:180-nf] then, that light holds possession of the whole world, where now can there be any ungenerated darkness? or how can darkness be understood to exist at all, unless it is something simply accidental? Archelaus said: Forasmuch, indeed, as the word of the Gospel is understood much better by you than by this person who puts himself forward as the Paraclete, although I could call him rather parasite than paraclete, I shall tell you how it has happened that there is darkness. When the light had been diffused everywhere, God began to constitute the universe, and commenced with the heaven and the earth; in which process this issue appeared, to wit, that the midst,[fn-34-P3440_921991:181-nf] which is the locality of earth covered with shadow, as a consequence of the interposition[fn-34-P3441_922098:182-nf] of the creatures which were called into being, was found to be obscure, in such wise that circumstances required light to be introduced into that place, which was thus situated in the midst. Hence in Genesis, where Moses gives an account of the construction of the world, he makes no mention of the darkness either as made or as not made. But he keeps silence on that subject, and leaves the explanation of it to be discovered by those who may be able to give proper attention to it. Neither, indeed, is that a very arduous and difficult task. For to whom may it not he made plain that this sun of ours is visible, when it has risen in the east, and taken its course toward the west, but that when it has gone beneath the earth, and been carried farther within that formation which among the Greeks is called the sphere, it then ceases to appear, being overshadowed in darkness in consequence of the interposition of the bodies?[fn-34-P3442_923110:183-nf] When it is thus covered, and when the body of the earth stands opposite it, a shadow is superinduced, which produces from itself the darkness; and it continues so until again, after the course of the inferior space has been traversed in the night, it rolls towards the east, and is seen to rise once more in its wonted seats. Thus, then, the cause of the shadow and the night is discovered in the solidity of the body of the earth,-a thing, indeed, which a man may understand from the fact of the shadow cast by his own body.[fn-34-P3443_924182:184-nf] For before the heaven and the earth and all those corporeal creatures appeared, the light remained always constant, without waning or eclipse, as there existed no body which might produce shadow by its opposition or intervention; and consequently one must say that nowhere was there darkness then, and nowhere night. For if, to take an illustration, it should please Him who has the power of all things to do away with the quarter[fn-34-P3444_924715:185-nf] which lies to the west, then, as the sun would not direct its course toward that region, there would nowhere emerge either evening or darkness, but the sun would be on its course always, and would never set, but would almost always hold the centre tract of heaven, and would never cease to appear; and by this the whole world would be illumined with the clearest light, in virtue of which no part of it would suffer obscuration, but the equal power of one light would remain everywhere. But on the other hand, while the western quarter keeps its position, and the sun executes[fn-34-P3445_925307:186-nf] its course in three parts of the world, then those who are under the sun will be seen to be illuminated more brightly; so that I might almost say, that while the people who belong to the diverse tract are still asleep, those former are in possession of the day's beginning. But just[fn-34-P3446_925610:187-nf] as those Orientals have the light rising on them earlier than the people who live in the west, so they have it also more quickly obscured, and they only who are settled in the middle of the globe see always an equality of light. For when the sun occupies the middle of the heavens, there is no place that can appear to be either brighter or darker (than another), but all parts of the world are illuminated equally and impartially by the sun's effulgence.[fn-34-P3447_926145:188-nf] If, then, as we have said above, that portion of the western tract were done away with, the part which is adjacent to it would now no more suffer obscuration. And these things I could indeed set forth somewhat more simply, as I might also describe the zodiacal circle; but I have not thought of looking into these matters at present.[fn-34-P3448_926587:189-nf] I shall therefore say nothing of these, but shall revert to that capital objection urged by my adversary, in his affirming so strenuously[fn-34-P3449_926874:190-nf] that the darkness is ungenerated; which position, however, has also been confuted already, as far as that could have been done by us.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question. May it be well with you, incomparable and honourable father!","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life.

But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary to Moses. And first, as to the word, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-37-P3743_1051433:461-nf] -that is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\"[fn-37-P3744_1051836:462-nf] But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just[fn-37-P3745_1051932:463-nf] that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then, to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence [fn-37-P3746_1052606:464-nf] of goodness, indeed, when one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, \"I make the rich man and the poor man,\"[fn-37-P3747_1052946:465-nf] whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.[fn-37-P3748_1053006:466-nf] Well, in that saying Jesus did; not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed[fn-37-P3749_1053192:467-nf] with pride, but have the gentle and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to think.[fn-37-P3750_1053388:468-nf] This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly. For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they are put into the treasury.[fn-37-P3751_1053611:469-nf] All too little, at the same time, is it[fn-37-P3752_1053672:470-nf] if gifts are cast into[fn-37-P3753_1053895:471-nf] the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man says, further, that it is written, that \"except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-37-P3754_1054456:472-nf] Wall, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;[fn-37-P3755_1054636:473-nf] so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently, to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable of it; but, at the, same time, to employ[fn-37-P3756_1054971:474-nf] riches for the work of righteousness and mercy, is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;[fn-37-P3757_1055410:475-nf] for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.[fn-37-P3758_1055469:476-nf] And this, the law's relation to the Sabbath, was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom's chamber, and who prepares the same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger, but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom's arrival; so that when he is come, the same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, \"Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? \"[fn-37-P3759_1056134:477-nf] And again, He did not actually reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead the cause of circumcision,[fn-37-P3760_1056364:478-nf] relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.[fn-37-P3761_1056521:479-nf] For what, indeed, can it profit a man to circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour? He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,[fn-37-P3762_1056873:480-nf] lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear splendid to men's view, we should inwardly he comparable only to ravening wolves,[fn-37-P3763_1057292:481-nf] or be likened to whited sepulchres.[fn-37-P3764_1057350:482-nf] For far above any person of that type of character is to be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless they happen also to he fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture has to say on this subject: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God? \"[fn-37-P3765_1057888:483-nf] What need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted with the compendious way of life,[fn-37-P3766_1058041:484-nf] and know that it shall he mine if only I can be pure in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit, that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and the prophets.[fn-37-P3767_1058313:485-nf] Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us yet clearer instruction on the subject, when be says, \"Or seek yea proof of that Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-37-P3768_1058522:486-nf] What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified in uncircumcision? For it is written: \"Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.\"[fn-37-P3769_1058856:487-nf] Consequently, as circumcision is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made forthwith a transgressor[fn-37-P3770_1059118:488-nf] of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised, and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life. For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in the mere ink,[fn-37-P3771_1059591:489-nf] in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.[fn-37-P3772_1059667:490-nf] Wherefore let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthen-ware in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,[fn-37-P3773_1060140:491-nf] are to be held in abhor-fence by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means[fn-37-P3774_1060481:492-nf] stand in need of that most profitless fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil. Far be it from me to do so! If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle's first epistle.[fn-37-P3775_1060860:493-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-06","text":"42.

If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle's first epistle.[fn-37-P3775_1060860:493-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-06","text":"42. But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary to Moses. And first, as to the word, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-37-P3743_1051433:461-nf] -that is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\"[fn-37-P3744_1051836:462-nf] But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just[fn-37-P3745_1051932:463-nf] that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then, to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence [fn-37-P3746_1052606:464-nf] of goodness, indeed, when one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, \"I make the rich man and the poor man,\"[fn-37-P3747_1052946:465-nf] whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.[fn-37-P3748_1053006:466-nf] Well, in that saying Jesus did; not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed[fn-37-P3749_1053192:467-nf] with pride, but have the gentle and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to think.[fn-37-P3750_1053388:468-nf] This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly. For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they are put into the treasury.[fn-37-P3751_1053611:469-nf] All too little, at the same time, is it[fn-37-P3752_1053672:470-nf] if gifts are cast into[fn-37-P3753_1053895:471-nf] the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man says, further, that it is written, that \"except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-37-P3754_1054456:472-nf] Wall, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;[fn-37-P3755_1054636:473-nf] so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently, to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable of it; but, at the, same time, to employ[fn-37-P3756_1054971:474-nf] riches for the work of righteousness and mercy, is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;[fn-37-P3757_1055410:475-nf] for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.[fn-37-P3758_1055469:476-nf] And this, the law's relation to the Sabbath, was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom's chamber, and who prepares the same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger, but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom's arrival; so that when he is come, the same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, \"Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? \"[fn-37-P3759_1056134:477-nf] And again, He did not actually reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead the cause of circumcision,[fn-37-P3760_1056364:478-nf] relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.[fn-37-P3761_1056521:479-nf] For what, indeed, can it profit a man to circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour? He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,[fn-37-P3762_1056873:480-nf] lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear splendid to men's view, we should inwardly he comparable only to ravening wolves,[fn-37-P3763_1057292:481-nf] or be likened to whited sepulchres.[fn-37-P3764_1057350:482-nf] For far above any person of that type of character is to be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless they happen also to he fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture has to say on this subject: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God? \"[fn-37-P3765_1057888:483-nf] What need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted with the compendious way of life,[fn-37-P3766_1058041:484-nf] and know that it shall he mine if only I can be pure in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit, that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and the prophets.[fn-37-P3767_1058313:485-nf] Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us yet clearer instruction on the subject, when be says, \"Or seek yea proof of that Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-37-P3768_1058522:486-nf] What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified in uncircumcision? For it is written: \"Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.\"[fn-37-P3769_1058856:487-nf] Consequently, as circumcision is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made forthwith a transgressor[fn-37-P3770_1059118:488-nf] of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised, and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life. For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in the mere ink,[fn-37-P3771_1059591:489-nf] in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.[fn-37-P3772_1059667:490-nf] Wherefore let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthen-ware in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,[fn-37-P3773_1060140:491-nf] are to be held in abhor-fence by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means[fn-37-P3774_1060481:492-nf] stand in need of that most profitless fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil.

The sentence of the Lord that it is unlawful to withdraw from wedlock, save on account of fornication,[fn-47-P4734_1466156:26-nf] applies, according to the argument, to men and women alike. Custom, however, does not so obtain. Yet, in relation with women, very strict expressions are to be found; as, for instance, the words of the apostle \"He which is joined to a harlot is one body\"[fn-47-P4735_1466429:27-nf] and of Jeremiah, If a wife \"become another man's shall be return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted?\"[fn-47-P4736_1466572:28-nf] And again, \"He that hath an adulteress is a feel and impious.\"[fn-47-P4737_1466653:29-nf] Yet custom ordains that men who commit adultery and are in fornication be retained by their wives. Consequently I do not know if the woman who lives with the man who has been dismissed can properly be called an adulteress; the charge in this case attaches to the woman who has put away her husband, and depends upon the cause for which she withdrew from wedlock.[fn-47-P4738_1467043:30-nf] In the case of her being beaten, and refusing to submit, it would be better for her to endure than to be separated from her husband; in the case of her objecting to pecuniary loss, even here she would not have sufficient ground. If her reason is his living in fornication we do not find this in the custom of the church; but from an unbelieving husband a wife is commanded not to depart, but to remain, on account of the uncertainty of the issue. \"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shall save thy husband?\"[fn-47-P4739_1468431:31-nf] Here then the wife, if she leaves her husband and goes to another, is an adulteress. But the man who has been abandoned is pardonable, and the woman who lives with such a man is not condemned. But if the man who has deserted his wife goes to another, he is himself an adulterer because he makes her commit adultery; and the woman who lives with him is an adulteress, because she has caused another woman's husband to come over to her.","title":"Letter CLXXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_87_tractate_lxxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1.

He that believeth on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" And that it might be more evident that the Lord is speaking there, not of the cup, but of baptism, the Scripture adds, saying, \"But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive.\"[fn-59-P5977_1880006:17-nf] For by baptism the Holy Spirit is received; and thus by those who are baptized, and have attained to the Holy Spirit, is attained the drinking of the Lord's cup.

They have pronounced their prohibition of old \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife\";[fn-32-P3256_1068610:4-nf] and through the holy gospels they say that \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already with her in his heart.\"[fn-32-P3257_1068774:5-nf] Now they see the bride of the Lord herself, whose head is Christ, boldly committing adultery.[fn-32-P3258_1068884:6-nf] So too would groan the companies[fn-32-P3259_1068945:7-nf] of the Saints. Phinehas, the zealous, because he can now no more take his spear into his hands and avenge the outrage on the bodies; and John the Baptist, because he cannot quit the realms above, as in his life he left the wilderness, to hasten to convict iniquity, and if he must suffer for the deed, rather lose his head than his freedom to speak. But, peradventure, like the blessed Abel, he too though dead yet speaks to us,[fn-32-P3260_1069439:8-nf] and now exclaims, more loudly than John of old concerning Herodias. \"It is not lawful for thee to have her.\"[fn-32-P3261_1069567:9-nf] For even if the body of John in obedience to the law of nature has received the sentence of God, and his tongue is silent, yet \"the word of God is not bound.\"[fn-32-P3262_1069744:10-nf] John, when he saw the wedlock of a fellow servant set at nought, was bold to rebuke even to the death: how would he feel on seeing such an outrage wreaked on the marriage chamber of the Lord?","title":"Letter XLVI","author":"St. Basil"}]
