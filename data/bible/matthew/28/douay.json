{"verses":["And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the\nfirst day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see\nthe sepulchre.","And behold there was a great earthquake.  For an angel of the Lord\ndescended from heaven and coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it.","And his countenance was as lightning and his raiment as snow.","And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror and\nbecame as dead men.","And the angel answering, said to the women:  Fear not you:  for I\nknow that you seek Jesus who was crucified.","He is not here.  For he is risen, as he said.  Come, and see the\nplace where the Lord was laid.","And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen.  And\nbehold he will go before you into Galilee.  There you shall see him.  Lo,\nI have foretold it to you.","And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great\njoy, running to tell his disciples.","And behold, Jesus met them, saying:  All hail.  But they came up\nand took hold of his feet and adored him.","Then Jesus said to them:  Fear not.  Go, tell my brethren that\nthey go into Galilee.  There they shall see me.","Who when they were departed, behold, some of the guards came\ninto the city and told the chief priests all things that had been done.","And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking\ncounsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,","Saying:  Say you, His disciples came by night and stole him away\nwhen we were asleep.","And if the governor shall hear of this, we will persuade him and\nsecure you.","So they taking the money, did as they were taught:  and this word\nwas spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.","And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.","And seeing him they adored:  but some doubted.","And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying:  All power is given to\nme in heaven and in earth.","Going therefore, teach ye all nations:  baptizing them in the\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.","Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded\nyou.  And behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the\nworld."]}
