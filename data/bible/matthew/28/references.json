You have long been anxious to break forth into speech; the very letters we have formed perceive it, and our paper already understands the question you are going to put. You will reply to us by saying: it was so of old, when \"the Lord loved the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob,\" and when her foundations were in the holy mountains.[fn-14-P1429_316361:962-nf] Even these verses, however, are susceptible of a deeper interpretation. But things are changed since then. The risen Lord has proclaimed intones of thunder: \"Your house is left unto you desolate.\" With tears He has prophesied its downfall: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not. Behold your house is left unto you desolate.\"[fn-14-P1430_316913:963-nf] The veil of the temple has been rent;[fn-14-P1431_316992:964-nf] an army has encompassed Jerusalem, it has been stained by the blood of the Lord. Now, therefore, its guardian angels have forsaken it and the grace of Christ has been withdrawn. Josephus, himself a Jewish writer, asserts[fn-14-P1432_317237:965-nf] that at the Lord's crucifixion there broke from the temple voices of heavenly powers, saying: \"Let us depart hence.\" These and other considerations show that where grace abounded there did sin much more abound.[fn-14-P1433_317479:966-nf] Again, when the apostles received the command: \"Go ye and teach all nations,\"[fn-14-P1434_317576:967-nf] and when they said themselves: \"It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you, but seeing ye put it from you ...lo we turn to the Gentiles,\"[fn-14-P1435_317769:968-nf] then all the spiritual importance[fn-14-P1436_317825:969-nf] of Judaea and its old intimacy with God were transferred by the apostles to the nations.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"835","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"6. Let me now fulfil the promise I made a little while ago and with all the skill of a rhetorician sing the praises of water and of baptism. In the beginning the earth was without form and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The Spirit of God above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters,[fn-28-P2879_762983:2051-nf] and produced from them the infant world, a type of the Christian child that is drawn from the laver of baptism. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,-in the Hebrew Shamayim or `what comes out of the waters,'-[fn-28-P2880_763268:2052-nf] and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of God. Wherefore also in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel there is seen above the cherubim a crystal stretched forth,[fn-28-P2881_763585:2053-nf] that is, the compressed and denser waters. The first living beings come out of the waters; and believers soar out of the layer with wings to heaven. Man is formed out of clay[fn-28-P2882_763782:2054-nf] and God holds the mystic waters in the hollow of his hand.[fn-28-P2883_763862:2055-nf] In Eden a garden[fn-28-P2884_763944:2056-nf] is planted, and a fountain in the midst of it parts into four heads.[fn-28-P2885_764033:2057-nf] This is the same fountain which Ezekiel later on describes as issuing out of the temple and flowing towards the rising of the sun, until it heals the bitter waters and quickens those that are dead.[fn-28-P2886_764265:2058-nf] When the world falls into sin nothing but a flood of waters can cleanse it again. But as soon as the foul bird of wickedness is driven away, the dove of the Holy Spirit comes to Noah[fn-28-P2887_764489:2059-nf] as it came afterwards to Christ in the Jordan,[fn-28-P2888_764574:2060-nf] and, carrying ill its beak a branch betokening restoration and light, brings tidings of peace to the whole world. Pharaoh and his host, loth to allow God's people to leave Egypt, are overwhelmed in the Red Sea figuring thereby our baptism. His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: \"Thou didst endow the sea with virtue through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters: thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.\"[fn-28-P2889_765053:2061-nf] For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places[fn-28-P2890_765139:2062-nf] and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.[fn-28-P2891_765228:2063-nf] As wood sweetens Marah so that seventy palm-trees are watered by its streams, so the cross makes the waters of the law lifegiving to the seventy who are Christ's apostles.[fn-28-P2892_765444:2064-nf] It is Abraham and Isaac who dig wells, the Philistines who try to prevent them.[fn-28-P2893_765561:2065-nf] Beersheba too, the city of the oath,[fn-28-P2894_765637:2066-nf] and [Gihon], the scene of Solomon's coronation,[fn-28-P2895_765708:2067-nf] derive their names from springs. It is beside a well that Eliezer finds Rebekah.[fn-28-P2896_765833:2068-nf] Rachel too is a drawer of water and wins a kiss thereby[fn-28-P2897_765928:2069-nf] from the supplanter[fn-28-P2898_765987:2070-nf] Jacob. When the daughters of the priests of Midian are in a strait to reach the well, Moses opens a way for them and delivers them from outrage.[fn-28-P2899_766157:2071-nf] The Lord's forerunner at Salem (a name which means peace or perfection) makes ready the people for Christ with spring-water.[fn-29-P2900_766319:2072-nf] The Saviour Himself does not preach the kingdom of heaven until by His baptismal immersion He has cleansed the Jordan.[fn-29-P2901_766461:2073-nf] Water is the matter of His first miracle[fn-29-P2902_766542:2074-nf] and it is from a well that the Samaritan woman is bidden to slake her thirst.[fn-29-P2903_766699:2075-nf] To Nicodemus He secretly says:-\"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\"[fn-29-P2904_766857:2076-nf] As His earthly course began with water, so it ended with it. His side is pierced by the spear, and blood and water flow forth, twin emblems of baptism and of martyrdom.[fn-29-P2905_767048:2077-nf] After His resurrection also, when sending His apostles to the Gentiles, He commands them to baptize these in the mystery of the Trinity.[fn-29-P2906_767263:2078-nf] The Jewish people repenting of their misdoing are sent forthwith by Peter to be baptized.[fn-29-P2907_767380:2079-nf] Before Sion travails she brings forth children, and a nation is born at once.[fn-29-P2908_767480:2080-nf] Paul the persecutor of the church, that ravening wolf out of Benjamin,[fn-29-P2909_767588:2081-nf] bows his head before Ananias one of Christ's sheep, and only recovers his sight when he applies the remedy of baptism.[fn-29-P2910_767731:2082-nf] By the reading of the prophet the eunuch of Candace the queen of Ethiopia is made ready for the baptism of Christ.[fn-29-P2911_767901:2083-nf] Though it is against nature the Ethiopian does change his skin and the leopard his spots.[fn-29-P2912_768018:2084-nf] Those who have received only John's baptism and have no knowledge of the Holy Spirit are baptized again, lest any should suppose that water unsanctified thereby could suffice for the salvation of either Jew or Gentile.[fn-29-P2913_768261:2085-nf] \"The voice of the Lord isupon the waters ...The Lord is uponmany waters ...the Lord maketh the flood to inhabit it.\"[fn-29-P2914_768398:2086-nf] His \"teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing; whereof everyone bear twins, and none is barren among them.\"[fn-29-P2915_768625:2087-nf] If none is barren among them, all of them must have udders filled with milk and be able to say with the apostle: \"Ye are my little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;\"[fn-29-P2916_768853:2088-nf] and \"I have fed you with milk and not with meat.\"[fn-29-P2917_768925:2089-nf] And it is to the grace of baptism that the prophecy of Micah refers: \"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities, and will cast all our sins[fn-29-P2918_769130:2090-nf] into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-29-P2919_769207:2091-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":28,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1099","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9. To make a long story short, leaving on her left the mausoleum of Helena queen of Adiabene[fn-39-P3903_1056635:2772-nf] who in time of famine had sent corn to the Jewish people, Paula entered Jerusalem, Jebus, or Salem, that city of three names which after it had sunk to ashes and decay was by Aelius Hadrianus restored once more as Aelia.[fn-39-P3904_1056891:2773-nf] And although the proconsul of Palestine, who was an intimate friend of her house, sent forward his apparitors and gave orders to have his official residence[fn-39-P3905_1057139:2774-nf] placed at her disposal, she chose a humble cell in preference to it. Moreover, in visiting the holy places so great was the passion and the enthusiasm she exhibited for each, that she could never have torn herself away from one had she not been eager to visit the rest. Before the Cross she threw herself down in adoration as though she beheld the Lord hanging upon it: and when she entered the tomb which was the scene of the Resurrection she kissed the stone which the angel had rolled away from the door of the sepulchre.[fn-39-P3906_1057721:2775-nf] Indeed so ardent was her faith that she even licked with her mouth the very spot on which the Lord's body had lain, like one athirst for the river which he has longed for. What tears she shed there, what groans she uttered, and what grief she poured forth, all Jerusalem knows; the Lord also to whom she prayed knows. Going out thence she made the ascent of Zion; a name which signifies either \"citadel\" or \"watch-tower.\" This formed the city which David formerly stormed and afterwards rebuilt.[fn-39-P3907_1058243:2776-nf] Of its storming it is written, \"Woe to Ariel, to Ariel\"-that is, God's lion, (and indeed in those days it was extremely strong)-\"the city which David stormed:\"[fn-39-P3908_1058438:2777-nf] and of its rebuilding it is said, \"His foundation is in the holy mountains: the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\"[fn-39-P3909_1058616:2778-nf] He does not mean the gates which we see to-day in dust and ashes; the gates he means are those against which hell prevails not[fn-39-P3910_1058784:2779-nf] and through which the multitude of those who believe in Christ enter in.[fn-39-P3911_1058881:2780-nf] There was shewn to her upholding the portico of a church the bloodstained column to which our Lord is said to have been bound when He suffered His scourging.

[We believe] also in the Holy Spirit, who is given to believers for their consolation, sanctification, and perfection; even as our Lord Jesus Christ commanded his disciples, saying,[fn-6-P611_248873:15-nf] `Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'; that is to say of the Father who is truly the Father, of the Son who is truly the Son, and of the Holy Spirit who is truly the Holy Spirit, these words not being simply or insignificantly applied, but accurately expressing the proper subsistence, glory, and order, of each of these who are named: so that there are three in person, but one in concordance. Holding therefore this faith in the presence of God and of Christ, we anathematize all heretical and false doctrine. And if any one shall teach contrary to the sound and right faith of the Scriptures, affirming that there is or was a period or an age before the Son of God existed, let him be accursed. And if any one shall say that the Son is a creature as one of the creatures, or that he is offspring as one of the offsprings, and shall not hold each of the aforesaid doctrines as the Divine Scriptures have delivered them to us: or if any one shall teach or preach any other doctrine contrary to that which we have received, let him be accursed. For we truly and unreservedly believe and follow all things handed down to us from the sacred Scriptures by the prophets and apostles.","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"174","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"It is evident that there is one God, the Father Almighty, according as it is declared over the whole world; and his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, our Lord, God, and Saviour, begotten of him before the ages. But we ought not to say that there are two Gods, since the Lord himself has said `I go unto my Father and your Father, and unto my God and your God.'[fn-8-P816_344141:110-nf] Therefore he is God even of all, as the apostle also taught, `Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yea of the Gentiles also; seeing that it is one God who shall justify the circumcision by faith.'[fn-8-P817_344386:111-nf] And in all other matters there is agreement, nor is there any ambiguity. But since it troubles very many to understand about that which is termed substantia in Latin, and ousia in Greek; that is to say, in order to mark the sense more accurately, the word homoousion[fn-8-P818_344688:112-nf] or homoiousion,[fn-8-P819_344734:113-nf] it is altogether desirable that none of these terms should be mentioned: nor should they be preached on in the church, for this reason, that nothing is recorded concerning them in the holy Scriptures; and because these things are above the knowledge of mankind and human capacity, and that no one can explain the Son's generation, of which it is written, `And who shall declare his generation?'[fn-8-P820_345158:114-nf] It is manifest that the Father only knows in what way he begat the Son; and again the Son, how he was begotten by the Father. But no one can doubt that the Father is greater in honor, dignity, and divinity, and in the very name of Father; the Son himself testifying `My Father who hath sent me is greater than I.'[fn-8-P821_345493:115-nf] And no one is ignorant that this is also catholic doctrine,[fn-8-P822_345574:116-nf] that there are two persons of the Father and Son, and that the Father is the greater: but that the Son is subject, together with all things which the Father has subjected to him. That the Father had no beginning, and is invisible, immortal, and impossible: but that the Son was begotten of the Father, God of God, Light of Light; and that no one comprehends his generation, as was before said, but the Father alone. That the Son himself, our Lord and God, took flesh or a body, that is to say human nature, according as the angel brought glad tidings: and as the whole Scriptures teaches, and especially the apostle who was the great teacher of the Gentiles, Christ assumed the human nature through which he suffered, from the Virgin Mary. But the summary and confirmation of the entire faith is, that [the doctrine of] the Trinity should be always maintained, according as we have read in the gospel, `Go ye and disciple all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.'[fn-8-P823_346636:117-nf] Thus the number of the Trinity is complete and perfect.

Do you maintain that the Son is numbered under the Father, and the Spirit under the Son, or do you confine your sub-numeration to the Spirit alone? If, on the other hand, you apply this sub-numeration also to the Son, you revive what is the same impious doctrine, the unlikeness of the substance, the lowliness of rank, the coming into being in later time, and once for all, by this one term, you will plainly again set circling all the blasphemies against the Only-begotten. To controvert these blasphemies would be a longer task than my present purpose admitsof; and I am the less bound to undertake it because the impiety has been refuted elsewhere to the best of my ability.[fn-16-P1615_403156:374-nf] If on the other hand they suppose the sub-numeration to benefit the Spirit alone, they must be taught that the Spirit is spoken of together with the Lord in precisely the same manner in which the Son is spoken of with the Father. \"The name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\"[fn-16-P1616_404409:375-nf] is delivered in like manner, and, according to the co-ordination of words delivered in baptism, the relation of the Spirit to the Son is the same as that of the Son to the Father.

Nay, without exception, what thing ever lost its own nature by being numbered? Is it not the fact that things when numbered remain what they naturally and originally were, while number is adopted among us as a sign indicative of the plurality of subjects? For some bodies we count, some we measure, and some we weigh;[fn-16-P1618_405305:377-nf] those which are by nature continuous we apprehend by measure; to those which are divided we apply number (with the exception of those which on account of their fineness are measured); while heavy objects are distinguished by the inclination of the balance. It does not however follow that, because we have invented for our convenience symbols to help us to arrive at the knowledge of quantity, we have therefore changed the nature of the things signified. We do not speak of \"weighing under\" one another things which are weighed, even though one be gold and the other tin; nor yet do we \"measure under\" things that are measured; and so in the same way we will not \"number under\" things which are numbered. And if none of the rest of things admits of sub-numeration how can they allege that the Spirit ought to be subnumerated?

We do not fritter away the theology[fn-16-P1628_410878:382-nf] in a divided plurality,because one Form, so to say, united[fn-16-P1629_411900:383-nf] in the invariableness of the Godhead, is beheld in God the Father, and in God the Only begotten. For the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; since such as is the latter, such is the former, and such as is the former, such is the latter; and herein is the Unity. So that according to the distinction of Persons, both are one and one, and according to the community of Nature, one. How, then, if one and one, are there not two Gods? Because we speak of a king, and of the king's image, and not of two kings. The majesty is not cloven in two, nor the glory divided. The sovereignty and authority over us is one, and so the doxology ascribed by us is not plural but one;[fn-16-P1630_412599:384-nf] because the honour paid to the image passes on to the prototype. Now what in the one case the image is by reason of imitation, that in the other case the Son is by nature; and as in works of art the likeness is dependent on the form, so in the case or the divine and uncompounded nature the union consists in the communion of the Godhead.[fn-16-P1631_413128:385-nf] One, moreover, is the Holy Spirit, and we speak of Him singly, conjoined as He is to the one Father through the one Son, and through Himself completing the adorable and blessed Trinity. Of Him the intimate relationship to the Father and the Son is sufficiently declared by the fact of His not being ranked in the plurality of the creation, but being spoken of singly; for he is not one of many, but One. For as there is one Father and one Son, so is there one Holy Ghost. He is consequently as far removed from created Nature as reason requires the singular to be removed from compound and plural bodies; and He is in such wise united to the Father and to the Son as unit has affinity with unit.

As we find both expressions in use among the faithful, we use both; in the belief that full glory is equally given to the Spirit by both. The mouths, how, ever, of revilers of the truth may best be stopped by the preposition which, while it has the same meaning as that of the Scriptures, is not so wieldy a weapon for our opponents,(indeed it is now an object of their attack) and is used instead of the conjunction and. For to say \"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy\"[fn-17-P1794_461640:512-nf] is precisely the same thing as to say Paul with Timothy and Silvanus; for the connexion of the names is, preserved by either mode of expression. The Lord says \"The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-17-P1795_461861:513-nf] If I say the Father and the Son with the Holy Ghost shall I make, any difference in the sense? Of the connexion of names by means of the conjunction and the instances are many. We read \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-17-P1796_462149:514-nf] and again \"I beseech you for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1797_462333:515-nf] Now if we wish to use with instead of and, what difference shall we have made? I do not see; unless any one according to hard and fast grammatical rules might prefer the conjunction as copulative and making the union stronger, and reject the preposition as of inferior force. But if we had to defend ourselves on these points I do not suppose we should require a defence of many words. As it is, their argument is not about syllables nor yet about this or that sound of a word, but about things differing. most widely in power and in truth. It is for this reason that, while the use of the syllables is really a matter of no importance whatever, our opponents are making the endeavour to authorise some syllables, and bunt out others from the Church. For my own part, although the usefulness of the word is obvious as soon as it is heard, I will nevertheless set forth the arguments which led our fathers to adopt the reasonable coarse of employing the preposition \"with.\"[fn-17-P1798_463328:516-nf] It does indeed equally well with the preposition \"and,\" confute the mischief of Sabellius;[fn-17-P1799_463444:517-nf] and it sets forth quite as well as \"and\" the distinction of the hypostases, as in the words \"I and my Father will come,\"[fn-18-P1800_463589:518-nf] and \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-18-P1801_463640:519-nf] In addition to this the proof it contains of the eternal fellowship and uninterrupted conjunction is excellent. For to say that the Son is with the Father is to exhibit at once the distinction of the hypostases, and the inseparability of the fellowship. The same thing is observable even in mere human matters, for the conjunction \"and\" intimates that there is a common element in an action, while the preposition \"with\" declares in some sense as well the communion in action. As, for instance;-Paul and Timothy sailed to MaCedonia, but both Tychicus and Onesimus were sent to the Colossians. Hence we learn that they did the same thing. But suppose we are told that they sailed with, and were sent with? Then we are informed in addition that they carried out the action in company with one another. Thus while the word \"with\" upsets the error of Sabellius as no other word can, it routs also sinners who err in the very opposite direction; those, I mean, who separate the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Son, by intervals of time.[fn-18-P1802_464907:520-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"170","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"61. Now, short and simple as this utter-ante is, it appears to me, as I consider it that its meanings are many and various. For of the senses in which \"in\" is used, we find that all help our conceptions of the Spirit. Form is said to be in Matter; Power to be in what is capable of it; Habit to be in him who is affected by it; and so on.[fn-18-P1809_468427:522-nf] Therefore, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit perfects rational beings, completing their excellence, He is analogous to Form. For he, who no longer \"lives after the flesh,\"[fn-18-P1810_468612:523-nf] but, being\"led by the Spirit of God,\"[fn-18-P1811_468786:524-nf] is called a Son of God, being\"conformed to tile image of the Son of God,\"[fn-18-P1812_468885:525-nf] is described as spiritual. And as is the power of seeing in the healthy eye, so is the operation of the Spirit in the purified soul. Wherefore also Paul prays for the Ephesians that they may have their\"eyes enlightened\" by \"the Spirit of wisdom.\"[fn-18-P1813_469516:526-nf] And as the art in him who has acquired it, so is the grace of the Spirit in the recipient ever present, though not continuously in operation. For as the art is potentially in the artist, but only in operation when he is working in accordance with it, so also the Spirit is ever present with those that are worthy, but works, as need requires, in prophecies, or in healings, or in some other actual carrying into effect of His potential action.[fn-18-P1814_469982:527-nf] Furthermore as in our bodies is health, or heat, or, generally, their variable conditions, so, very frequently is the Spirit in the soul; since He does not abide with those who, on account of the instability of their will, easily reject the grace which they have received. An instance of this is seen in Saul,[fn-18-P1815_470314:528-nf] and the seventy elders of the children of Israel, except Eldad and Medad, with whom alone the Spirit appears to have remained,[fn-18-P1816_470462:529-nf] and, generally, any one similar to these in character. And like reason in the soul, which is at one time the thought in the heart, and at another speech uttered by the tongue,[fn-18-P1817_470661:530-nf] so is the Holy Spirit, as when He\"beareth witness with our spirit,\"[fn-18-P1818_471173:531-nf] and when lie \"cries in our hearts, Abba, Father,\"[fn-18-P1819_471246:532-nf] or when He speaks on our behalf, as it is said, \"It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of our Father which speaketh in you.\"[fn-18-P1820_471457:533-nf] Again, the Spirit is conceived of, in relation to the distribution of gifts, as a whole in parts. For we all are \"members one of another, having girls differing according to the grace that is given us.\"[fn-18-P1821_471960:534-nf] Wherefore \"the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you,\"[fn-18-P1822_472105:535-nf] but all together complete the Body of Christ in the Unity of the Spirit, and render to one another the needful aid that comes of the gifts. \"But God hath set the members in the body, every one of them, as it hath pleased Him.\"[fn-18-P1823_472351:536-nf] But \"the members have the same care for one another,\"[fn-18-P1824_472425:537-nf] according to the inborn spiritual communion of their sympathy. Wherefore, \"whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\"[fn-18-P1825_472643:538-nf] And as parts in the whole so are we individually in the Spirit, because we all \"were baptized in one body into one spirit.\"[fn-18-P1826_472791:539-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"190","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"75.

This; that I was in the first place led to the glory of the Spirit by the honour conferred by the Lord in associating Him with Himself and with His Father at baptism;[fn-19-P1939_528440:629-nf] and secondly by the introduction of each of us to the knowledge of God by such an initiation; and above all by the fear of the threatened punishment shutting out the thought of all indignity and unworthy conception. But our opponents, what will they say? After shewing neither reverence for the Lord's honour[fn-19-P1940_528954:630-nf] nor fear of His threats, what kind of defence will they have for their blasphemy? It is for them to make up their mind about their own action or even now to change it.

In short \"to them that have in themselves the sentence of death,\"[fn-19-P1942_529656:632-nf] it is not suffering for the sake of the Faith which is painful; what is hard to bear is to fail to fight its battle.

Our reply is briefly this,-the words knew and till in the language of Holy Scripture are capable of a double meaning. As to the former, he himself gave us a dissertation to show that it must be referred to sexual intercourse, and no one doubts that it is often used of the knowledge of the understanding, as, for instance, \"the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew it not.\" Now we have to prove that just as in the one case he has followed the usage of Scripture, so with regard to the word till he is utterly refuted by the authority of the same Scripture, which often denotes by its use a fixed time (he himself told us so), frequently time without limitation, as when God by the mouth of the prophet says to certain persons,[fn-60-P6021_1785451:15-nf] \"Even to old age I am he.\" Will He cease to be God when they have grown old? And the Saviour in the Gospel tells the Apostles,[fn-60-P6022_1785596:16-nf] \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Will the Lord then after the end of the world has come forsake His disciples, and at the very time when seated on twelve thrones they are to judge the twelve tribes of Israel will they be bereft of the company of their Lord? Again Paul the Apostle writing to the Corinthians[fn-60-P6023_1785956:17-nf] says, \"Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's, at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.\" Granted that the passage relates to our Lord's human nature, we do not deny that the words are spoken of Him who endured the cross and is commanded to sit afterwards on the right hand. What does he mean then by saying, \"for he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet\"? Is the Lord to reign only until His enemies begin to be under His feet, and once they are under His feet will He cease to reign? Of course His reign will then commence in its fulness when His enemies begin to be under His feet.

For the elder, Cain, offered gifts to God from the fruit of the earth; but the younger son, Abel, from the fruit of his ewes. \"God had respect unto Abel, and unto his gifts; but unto Cain and unto his gifts He had not respect. And God said unto Cain, Why is thy countenance fallen? hast thou not-if thou offerest indeed aright, but dost not divide aright-sinned? Hold thy peace. For unto thee shall thy conversion be and he shall lord it over thee. And then Cain said unto Abel his brother, Let us go into the field: and he went away with him thither, and he slew him. And then God said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper? To whom God said, The voice of the blood of thy brother crieth forth unto me from the earth. Wherefore cursed is the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother. Groaning and trembling shalt thou be upon the earth, and every one who shall have found thee shall slay thee.\"[fn-21-P2116_719963:73-nf] From this proceeding we gather that the twofold sacrifices of \"the peoples\" were even from the very beginning foreshown. In short, when the sacerdotal law was being drawn up, through Moses, in Leviticus, we find it prescribed to the people of Israel that sacrifices should in no other place be offered to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give to \"the people\" Israel and to their brethren, in order that, on Israel's introduction thither, there should there be celebrated sacrifices and holocausts, as well for sins as for souls; and nowhere else but in the holy land.[fn-21-P2117_720711:74-nf] Why, accordingly, does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the prophets, that it should come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be offered sacrifices to God? as He says through the angel Malachi, one of the twelve prophets: \"I will not receive sacrifice from your hands; for from the rising sun unto the setting my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord Almighty: and in every place they offer clean sacrifices to my Name.\"[fn-21-P2118_721230:75-nf] Again, in the Pslams, David says: \"Bring to God, ye countries of the nations\"-undoubtedly because \"unto every land\" the preaching of the apostles had to \"go out\"[fn-21-P2119_721425:76-nf] -\"bring to God fame and honour; bring to God the sacrifices of His name: take up[fn-21-P2120_721639:77-nf] victims and enter into His courts.\"[fn-21-P2121_721724:78-nf] For that it is not by earthly sacrifices, but by spiritual, that offering is to be made to God, we thus read, as it is written, An heart contribulate and humbled is a victim for God; \"[fn-21-P2122_721987:79-nf] and elsewhere, \"Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and render to the Highest thy vows.\"[fn-21-P2123_722117:80-nf] Thus, accordingly, the spiritual \"sacrifices of praise\" are pointed to, and \"an heart contribulate\" is demonstrated an acceptable sacrifice to God. And thus, as carnal sacrifices are understood to be reprobated-of which Isaiah withal speaks, saying, \"To what end is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the Lord\"[fn-21-P2124_722471:81-nf] -so spiritual sacrifices are predicted[fn-21-P2125_722527:82-nf] as accepted, as the prophets announce. For, \"even if ye shall have brought me,\" He says, \"the finest wheat flour, it is a vain supplicatory gift: a thing execrable to me; \"and again He says, \"Your holocausts and sacrifices, and the fat of goats, and blood of bulls, I will not, not even if ye come to be seen by me: for who hath required these things from your hands? \"[fn-21-P2126_722918:83-nf] for \"from the rising sun unto the setting, my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2127_723081:84-nf] But of the spiritual sacrifices He adds, saying, \"And in every place they offer dean sacrifices to my Name, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2128_723233:85-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_20_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_philadelphians","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-01","text":"The priests[fn-20-P2087_352447:77-nf] indeed, and the ministers of the word, are good; but the High Priest is better, to whom the holy of holies has been committed, and who alone has been entrusted with the secrets of God.

And on this account, therefore, His words did not mean that He was about to die, and to be withdrawn from their view till His resurrection; but that He was about to go to the Father, which He did after His resurrection, and when, after holding intercourse with them for forty days, He ascended into heaven.[fn-33-P3362_1865982:16-nf] He therefore addressed the words, \"A little while, and ye shall no more see me,\" to those who saw Him at the time in bodily form; because He was about to go to the Father, and never thereafter to be seen in that mortal state wherein they now beheld Him when so addressing them.

Furthermore this is plainly taught by the divine Scripture, for so the holy Matthew narrates the event, \"When the even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus' disciple: he went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered, and when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.\"[fn-47-P4776_1177426:62-nf] See how often he mentions the body in order to stop the mouths of them who blaspheme the Godhead. The same course is pursued by the thrice blessed Mark, whose narrative I will also quote. \"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. And Pilate marvelled if He were already dead; and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph, and he brought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre,\"[fn-47-P4777_1178202:63-nf] and so on. Observe with admiration, the harmony of terms, and how consistently and continuously the word body is introduced. The illustrious Luke, too, relates just in the same way how Joseph begged the body and after he had received it treated it with due rites.[fn-47-P4778_1178487:64-nf] By the divine John we are told yet more, \"Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pound weight. Then took they the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at band.\"[fn-47-P4779_1179270:65-nf] Observe how often mention is made of the body; how the Evangelist shows that it was the body which was nailed to the cross, the body begged by Joseph of Pilate, the body taken down from the tree, the body wrapped in linen clothes with the myrrh and aloes, and then the name of the person given to it; and Jesus said to have been laid in a tomb. Thus the angel said, \"Come see the place where the Lord lay,\"[fn-47-P4780_1179699:66-nf] naming the part by the name of the whole; and we constantly do just the same. In this place, we say, such an one was buried; not the body of such an one. Every one in his senses knows that we are speaking of the body, and such a mode of speech is customary in divine Scripture. Aaron, we read, died and they buried him on Mount Hor.[fn-47-P4781_1180054:67-nf] Samuel died and they buried him at Ramah,[fn-47-P4782_1180113:68-nf] and there are many similar instances. The same use is followed by the divine Apostle when speaking of the death of the Lord. \"I delivered unto you first of all,\" he writes, \"that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-47-P4783_1180489:69-nf] and so on.","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":28,"verse":53,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"546","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"\"Was what rose from the dead, man or God?

As therefore the tares are gathered together and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of the world. The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all offenses.\"[fn-38-P3852_2120635:45-nf] Can He mean out of that kingdom in which are no offenses? Then it must be out of His present kingdom, the Church, that they are gathered. So He says, \"He that breaketh one of the least of these commandments, and teacheth men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth and teacheth thus shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-38-P3853_2121021:46-nf] He speaks of both as being in the kingdom of heaven, both the man who does not perform the commandments which He teaches,-for \"to break\" means not to keep, not to perform,-and the man who does and teaches as He did; but the one He calls least, the other great. And He immediately adds, \"For I say unto you, that except your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,\"-that is, the righteousness of those who break what they teach; for of the scribes and Pharisees He elsewhere says, \"For they say and do not;\"[fn-38-P3854_2121562:47-nf] -unless therefore, your righteousness exceed theirs that is, so that you do not break but rather do what you teach, \"ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-38-P3855_2121743:48-nf] We must understand in one sense the kingdom of heaven in which exist together both he who breaks what he teaches and he who does it, the one being least, the other great, and in another sense the kingdom of heaven into which only he who does what he teaches shall enter. Consequently, where both classes exist, it is the Church as it now is, but where only the one shall exist, it is the Church as it is destined to be when no wicked person shall be in her. Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly, even now His saints reign with Him, though otherwise than as they shall reign hereafter; and yet, though the tares grow in the Church along with the wheat, they do not reign with Him. For they reign with Him who do what the apostle says, \"If ye be risen with Christ, mind the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.

For if the God (in whom ye believe, ) even from His higher condition, prostrated the supreme dignity of His majesty to such a lowliness as to undergo death, even the death of the cross, why can you not suppose that some humiliations[fn-47-P4712_1502226:359-nf] are becoming to our God also, only more tolerable than Jewish contumelies, and crosses,[fn-47-P4713_1502335:360-nf] and sepulchres? Are these the humiliations which henceforth are to raise a prejudice against Christ (the subject as He is of human passions[fn-47-P4714_1502493:361-nf] ) being a partaker of that Godhead[fn-47-P4715_1502581:362-nf] against which you make the participation in human qualities a reproach? Now we believe that Christ did ever act in the name of God the Father; that He actually[fn-47-P4716_1502758:363-nf] from the beginning held intercourse with (men); actually[fn-47-P4717_1502829:364-nf] communed with[fn-47-P4718_1502857:365-nf] patriarchs and prophets; was the Son of the Creator; was His Word; whom God made His Son[fn-47-P4719_1502965:366-nf] by emitting Him from His own self,[fn-47-P4720_1503245:367-nf] and thenceforth set Him over every dispensation and (administration of) His will,[fn-47-P4721_1503360:368-nf] making Him a little lower than the angels, as is written in David.[fn-47-P4722_1503445:369-nf] In which lowering of His condition He received from the Father a dispensation in those very respects which you blame as human; from the very beginning learning,[fn-47-P4723_1503626:370-nf] even then, (that state of a) man which He was destined in the end to become.[fn-47-P4724_1503751:371-nf] It is He who descends, He who interrogates, He who demands, He who swears. With regard, however, to the Father, the very gospel which is common to us will testify that He was never visible, according to the word of Christ: \"No man knoweth the Father, save the Son.\"[fn-47-P4725_1505662:372-nf] For even in the Old Testament He had declared, \"No man shall see me, and live.\"[fn-47-P4726_1505763:373-nf] He means that the Father is invisible, in whose authority and in whose name was He God who appeared as the Son of God. But with us[fn-47-P4727_1505917:374-nf] Christ is received in the person of Christ, because even in this manner is He our God. Whatever attributes therefore you require as worthy of God, must be found in the Father, who is invisible and unapproachable, and placid, and (so to speak) the God of the philosophers; whereas those qualities which you censure as unworthy must be supposed to be in the Son, who has been seen, and heard, and encountered, the Witness and Servant of the Father, uniting in Himself man and God, God in mighty deeds, in weak ones man, in order that He may give to man as much as He takes from God. What in your esteem is the entire disgrace of my God, Is in fact the sacrament of man's salvation God held converse with man, that man might learn to act as God. God dealt on equal terms[fn-47-P4728_1506823:375-nf] with man, that man might be able to deal on equal terms with God. God was found little, that man might become very great. You who disdain such a God, I hardly know whether you ex fide believe that God was crucified. How great, then, is your perversity in respect of the two characters of the Creator! You designate Him as Judge, and reprobate as Cruelty that severity of the Judge which only acts in accord with the merits of cases. You require God to be very good, and yet despise as meanness that gentleness of His which accorded with His kindness, (and) held lowly converse in proportion to the mediocrity of man's estate. He pleases you not, whether great or little, neither as your judge nor as your friend! What if the same features should be discovered in your God? That He too is a judge, we have already shown in the proper section:[fn-47-P4729_1507689:376-nf] that from being a judge He must needs be severe; and from being severe He must also be cruel, if indeed cruel.[fn-47-P4730_1507853:377-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_108_letter_cviii_to_theodore_bishop_of_forum_julii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"The manifold mercy of God so assists men when they fall, that not only by the grace of baptism but also by the remedy of penitence is the hope of eternal life revived, in order that they who have violated the gifts of the second birth, condemning themselves by their own judgment, may attain to remission of their crimes, the provisions of the Divine Goodness having so ordained that God's indulgence cannot be obtained without the supplications of priests.

In the case of soul and body, which are of natures contemporary and naturally united, we are accustomed to make this distinction, describing the soul as simple, reasonable, and immortal, but the body as complex, passible, and mortal. We do not divide the union, nor cut one man in two. Far rather, then, in the case of the Godhead, begotten of the Father before the ages, and of the manhood assumed of David's seed, is it becoming to adopt a similar course, and distinctly to recognise the everlasting, eternal, simple, uncircumscribed, immortal, and invariable character of the one nature, and the recent, complex, circumscribed, and fluctuating nature of the other. We acknowledge the flesh to be now immortal and incorruptible, although before the resurrection it was susceptible of death and of passion; for how otherwise was it nailed to the tree, and committed to the tomb? And though we recognise the distinction of the natures, we are bound to worship one Son, and to acknowledge the same as Son of God and Son of man, form of God, and form of a servant, Son of David, and Lord of David, seed of Abraham, and creator of Abraham. The union causes the names to be common, but the community of names does not confound the natures. With them that are right-minded some names are plainly appropriate as to God, and others as to man; and in this way both the passible and the impassible are properly used of the Lord Christ, for in His humanity He suffered, while as God He remained impassible. If, according to the argument of the impious, it was in the Godhead that He suffered, then, I apprehend, the assumption of the flesh, was supererogatory; for suppose the divine nature to have been capable of undergoing passion, then He did not need the passible manhood. But grant that, as even their own argument contends, the Godhead was impassible, and the passion was real, let them beware of denying that which suffered, lest they deny with it the reality of the passion; for if that which suffers does not exist, then the passion is unreal. Now for any one who likes to open the quaternion[fn-61-P6162_1552027:335-nf] of the sacred evangelists, it is easy to perceive that the divine Scripture distinctly proclaims the passion of the body, and to learn from them how Joseph of Arimathaea came to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus; how Pilate ordered the body of Jesus to be delivered, how Joseph took down the body of Jesus from the tree and wrapped the body of Jesus in the linen cloth, and laid it in the new tomb. All this is described by the four evangelists with frequent mention of the body. But if our opponents adduce the words of the angel to Mary and her companions, \"Come where the Lord lay,\"[fn-61-P6163_1553067:336-nf] let them be referred to the passage in the Acts which states that devout men \"carried Stephen to his burial\"[fn-61-P6164_1553200:337-nf] and observe that it was not the soul, but the body, of the victorious Stephen, to which the customary rites were paid. And to this very day, when we approach the shrines of the victorious martyrs, we commonly enquire what is the name of him who is buried in the grave, and those who are acquainted with the facts reply peradventure\"Julian the martyr,\" or \"Romanus,\" or, \"Timotheus.\"[fn-61-P6165_1553604:338-nf] ","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":28,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"413","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"This is the unanimous teaching of the evangelists.

It may be, however, that some one will say to us: Peter had not actually gone out as yet, but had only risen with the purpose of going out. This may be the allegation of one who is of opinion that the second interrogation and denial took place when Peter was outside at the door. Let us therefore look at what follows in John's narrative. It is to this effect: \"The high priest then asked Jesus of His disciples, and of His doctrine. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in thesynagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. And when He had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? And Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.\"[fn-23-P2359_1005224:85-nf] This certainly shows us that Annas was high priest. For Jesus had not been sent to Caiaphas as yet, when the question was thus put to Him, \"Answerest thou the high priest so?\" Mention is also made of Annas and Caiaphas as high priests by Luke at the beginning of his Gospel.[fn-23-P2360_1005523:86-nf] After these statements, John reverts to the account which he had previously begun of Peter's denial. Thus he brings us back to the house in which the incidents took place which he has recorded, and from which Jesus was sent away to Caiaphas, to whom He was being conducted at the commencement of this scene, as Matthew has informed us.[fn-23-P2361_1005877:87-nf] Moreover, it is in the way of a recapitulation that John records the matters regarding Peter which he has introduced at this point. Falling back upon his narration of that incident with the view of making up a complete account of the threefold denial, he proceeds thus: \"And Simon stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.\"[fn-23-P2362_1006724:88-nf] Here, therefore, we find that Peter's second denial occurred, not when he was at the door,but as he was standing by the fire. This, however, could not have been the case, had he notreturned by this time after having gone outside.For it is not that by this second occasion he had actually gone out, and that the other maid who is referred to saw him there outside; but the matter is put as if it was on his going out that she saw him; or, in other words, it was when he rose to go out that she observed him, and said to those who were there,-that is, to those who were gathered by the fire inside, within the court,-\"This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.\" Then we are to suppose that the man who had thus gone outside, on hearing thisassertion, came in again, and swore to those whowere now inimically disposed, \"I do not know the man.\"[fn-23-P2363_1007588:89-nf] In like manner, Mark also says of this same maid, that \"she began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.\"[fn-23-P2364_1007729:90-nf] For this damsel was speaking not to Peter, but to those who had remained there when he went out. At the same time, she spoke in such a manner that he heard her words; whereupon he came back and stood again by the fire, and met their words with a negative. Then we have the statement made by John in these terms: \"They said, Art not thou also one of his disciples?\" We understand this question to have been addressed to him on his return as he stood there; and we also recognise the harmony in which this stands with the position that on this occasion Peter had to do not only with that other maid who is mentioned by Matthew and Mark in connection with this second denial, but also with that other person who is introduced by Luke. This is the reason why John uses the plural, \"They said.\" The explanation then may be, that when the maid said to those who were with her in the court as he went out, \"This is one of them,\" he heard her words and returned with the purpose of clearing himself, as it were, by a denial. Or, in accordance with the more probable theory, we may suppose that he did not catch what was said about him as he went out, and that on his return the maid and the other person who is introduced by Luke addressed him thus, \"Art not thou also one of his disciples?\" that he met them with a denial, \"and said, I am not;\" and further, that when this other person of whom Luke speaks insisted more pertinaciously, and said, \"Surely thou art one of them,\" Peter answered thus, \"Man, I am not.\" Still, when we compare together all the statements made by the several evangelists on this subject, we come clearly to the conclusion, that Peter's second denial took place, not when he was at the door, but when he was within, by the fire in the court. It becomes evident, therefore, that Matthew and Mark, who have told us how he went without, have left the fact of his return unnoticed simply with a view to brevity.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"116","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"63. Again, the same Matthew carries on his recital as follows: \"Now, in the evening of the Sabbath,[fn-25-P2598_1124158:249-nf] when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week,[fn-25-P2599_1124462:250-nf] came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold, them was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: And go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I have told you.\"[fn-26-P2600_1125310:251-nf] Mark is in harmony with this. It is possible, however, that some difficulty may be felt in the circumstance that, according to Matthew's version, the stone was already rolled away from the sepulchre, and the angel was sitting upon it. For Mark tells us that the women entered into the sepulchre, and there saw a young man sitting on the right side, covered with a long white garment, and that they were affrighted.[fn-26-P2601_1125751:252-nf] But the explanation may be, that Matthew has simply said nothing about the angel whom they saw when they entered into the sepulchre, and that Mark has said nothing about the one whom they saw sitting outside upon the stone. In this way they would have seen two angels, and have got two separate angelic reports relating to Jesus,-namely, first one from the angel whom they saw sitting outside upon the stone, and then another from the angel whom they saw sitting on the right side when they entered into the sepulchre. Thus, too, the injunction given them by the angel who was sitting outside, and which was conveyed in the words, \"Come, and see the place where the Lord lay,\" would have served to encourage them to go within the tomb; on coming to which, as has been said, and venturing within it, we may suppose then, to have seen the angel concerning whom Matthew tells us nothing, but of whom Mark discourses, sitting on the right side, from whom also they heard things of like tenor to those they had previously listened to. Or if this explanation is not satisfactory, we ought certainly to accept the theory that, as they entered into the sepulchre, they came within asection of the ground where, it is reasonable to suppose, a certain space had been by that time securely enclosed, extending a little distance in front of the rock which had been cut out in order to construct the place of sepulture; so that, according to this view, what they. really beheld was the one angel sitting on the right side, in the space thus referred to, which same angel Matthew also represents to have been sitting upon the stone which he had rolled away from the mouth of the tomb when the earthquake took place, that is to say, from the place which had been dug out in the rock for a sepulchre.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"117","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"64. It may also be asked how it is that Mark says: \"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they anything to any man; for they were afraid;\"[fn-26-P2603_1127761:253-nf] whereas Matthew's statement is in these terms: \"And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, and did run to bring His disciples word.[fn-26-P2604_1127940:254-nf] The explanation, however, may be that the women did not venture to tell either of the angels themselves,-that is, they had not courage enough to say anything in reply to what they had heard from the angels. Or, indeed, it may be that they were not bold enough to speak to the guards whom they saw lying there; for the joy which Matthew mentions is not inconsistent with the fear of which Mark takes notice. Indeed, we ought to have supposed that both feelings had possession of their minds, even although Matthew himself had said nothing about the fear. But now, when this evangelist also particularizes it, saying, \"They departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy,\" he allows nothing to remain which can occasion any question of difficulty on this subject.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"69. This being the case, therefore, let us, so far as the Lord may help us, take all these incidents, which took place about the time of the Lord's resurrection, as they are brought before us in the statements of all the evangelists together, and let us arrange them in one connected narrative, which will exhibit them, precisely as they may have actually occurred. It was in the early morning of the first day of the week, as all the evangelists are at one in attesting, that the women came to the sepulchre. By that time, all that is recorded by Matthew alone had already taken place; that is to say, in regard to the quaking of the earth, and the rolling away of the stone, and the terror of the guards, with which they were so stricken, that in some part they lay like dead men. Then, as John informs us, came Mary Magdalene, who unquestionably was surpassingly more ardent in her love than these other women[fn-26-P2632_1147978:277-nf] who had ministered to the Lord; so that it was not unreasonable in John to make mention of her alone, leaving those others unnamed, who, however, were along with her, as we gather from the reports given by others of the evangelists. She came accordingly; and when she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre, without pausing to make any more minute investigation, and never doubting but that the body of Jesus had been removed from the tomb, she ran, as the same John states, and told the state of matters to Peter and to John himself. For John is himself that disciple whom Jesus loved. They then set out running to the sepulchre; and John, reaching the spot first, stooped down and saw the linen clothes lying, but he did not go within. But Peter followed up, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, which had been about His head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then John entered also, and saw in like manner, and believed what Mary had told him, namely, that the Lord had been taken away from the sepulchre. \"For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping,\"[fn-26-P2633_1149284:278-nf] -that is to say, before the place in the rock in which the sepulchre was constructed, but at the same time within that space into which they had now entered; for there was a garden there, as the same John mentions.[fn-26-P2634_1149520:279-nf] Then they saw the angel sitting on the right side, upon the stone which was rolled away from the sepulchre; of which angel both Matthew and Mark discourse. \"Then he said unto them, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I have told you.\"[fn-26-P2635_1150041:280-nf] In Mark we also find a passage similar in tenor to the above. At these words, Mary, still weeping, bent down and looked forwards into the sepulchre, and beheld the two angels, who are introduced to us in John's narrative, sitting in white raiment, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been deposited. \"They say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\"[fn-26-P2636_1150543:281-nf] Here we are to suppose the angels to have risen up, so that they could be seen standing, as Luke states that they were seen, and then, according to the narrative of the same Luke, to have addressed the women, as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth. The terms were these: \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise. And they remembered His words.\"[fn-26-P2637_1151132:282-nf] It was after this that, as we learn from John, \"Mary turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if thou have borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\"[fn-26-P2638_1151793:283-nf] Then she departed from the sepulchre, that is to say, from the ground where there was space for the garden in front of the stone which had been dug out. Along with her there were also those other women, who, as Mark tells us, were surprised with fear and trembling. And they told nothing to any one. At this point we next take up what Matthew has recorded in the following passage: \"Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail! And they came and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.\"[fn-26-P2639_1152303:284-nf] For thus we gather that, on coming to the sepulchre, they were twice addressed by the angels; and, again, that they were also twice addressed by the Lord Himself, namely, at the point at which Mary took Him to be the gardener, and a second time at present, when He meets them on the way, with a view to strengthen them by such a repetition, and to bring them out of their state of fear. \"Then, accordingly, said He unto them, Be not afraid: go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\"[fn-26-P2640_1152847:285-nf] \"Then came Mary Magdalene, and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her;\"[fn-26-P2641_1152992:286-nf] -not herself alone, however, but with her also those other women to whom Luke alludes when he says, \"Which told these things unto the eleven disciples, and all the rest. And their words seemed to them like madness, and they believed them not.\"[fn-26-P2642_1153262:287-nf] Mark also attests these facts; for, after telling us how the women went out from the sepulchre, trembling and amazed, and said nothing to any man, he subjoins the statement, that the Lord rose early the first day of the week, and appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils, and that she went and told them who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept, and that they, when they heard that He was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.[fn-26-P2643_1153876:288-nf] It is further to be observed, that Matthew has also introduced a notice to the effect that, as the women who had seen and heard all these things were going away, there came likewise into the city some of the guards who had been lying like dead men, and that these persons reported to the chief priests all the things that were done, that is to say, those of them which they were themselves also in a position to observe. He tells us, moreover, that when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, and bade them say that His disciples came and stole Him away while they slept, promising at the same time to secure them against the governor, who had given those guards. Finally, he adds that they took the money, and did as they had been taught, and that this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.[fn-26-P2644_1154779:289-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"69.

Then John entered also, and saw in like manner, and believed what Mary had told him, namely, that the Lord had been taken away from the sepulchre. \"For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping,\"[fn-26-P2633_1149284:278-nf] -that is to say, before the place in the rock in which the sepulchre was constructed, but at the same time within that space into which they had now entered; for there was a garden there, as the same John mentions.[fn-26-P2634_1149520:279-nf] Then they saw the angel sitting on the right side, upon the stone which was rolled away from the sepulchre; of which angel both Matthew and Mark discourse. \"Then he said unto them, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I have told you.\"[fn-26-P2635_1150041:280-nf] In Mark we also find a passage similar in tenor to the above. At these words, Mary, still weeping, bent down and looked forwards into the sepulchre, and beheld the two angels, who are introduced to us in John's narrative, sitting in white raiment, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been deposited. \"They say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\"[fn-26-P2636_1150543:281-nf] Here we are to suppose the angels to have risen up, so that they could be seen standing, as Luke states that they were seen, and then, according to the narrative of the same Luke, to have addressed the women, as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth. The terms were these: \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise. And they remembered His words.\"[fn-26-P2637_1151132:282-nf] It was after this that, as we learn from John, \"Mary turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if thou have borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\"[fn-26-P2638_1151793:283-nf] Then she departed from the sepulchre, that is to say, from the ground where there was space for the garden in front of the stone which had been dug out. Along with her there were also those other women, who, as Mark tells us, were surprised with fear and trembling. And they told nothing to any one. At this point we next take up what Matthew has recorded in the following passage: \"Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail! And they came and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.\"[fn-26-P2639_1152303:284-nf] For thus we gather that, on coming to the sepulchre, they were twice addressed by the angels; and, again, that they were also twice addressed by the Lord Himself, namely, at the point at which Mary took Him to be the gardener, and a second time at present, when He meets them on the way, with a view to strengthen them by such a repetition, and to bring them out of their state of fear. \"Then, accordingly, said He unto them, Be not afraid: go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\"[fn-26-P2640_1152847:285-nf] \"Then came Mary Magdalene, and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her;\"[fn-26-P2641_1152992:286-nf] -not herself alone, however, but with her also those other women to whom Luke alludes when he says, \"Which told these things unto the eleven disciples, and all the rest. And their words seemed to them like madness, and they believed them not.\"[fn-26-P2642_1153262:287-nf] Mark also attests these facts; for, after telling us how the women went out from the sepulchre, trembling and amazed, and said nothing to any man, he subjoins the statement, that the Lord rose early the first day of the week, and appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils, and that she went and told them who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept, and that they, when they heard that He was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.[fn-26-P2643_1153876:288-nf] It is further to be observed, that Matthew has also introduced a notice to the effect that, as the women who had seen and heard all these things were going away, there came likewise into the city some of the guards who had been lying like dead men, and that these persons reported to the chief priests all the things that were done, that is to say, those of them which they were themselves also in a position to observe. He tells us, moreover, that when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, and bade them say that His disciples came and stole Him away while they slept, promising at the same time to secure them against the governor, who had given those guards. Finally, he adds that they took the money, and did as they had been taught, and that this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.[fn-26-P2644_1154779:289-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"69. This being the case, therefore, let us, so far as the Lord may help us, take all these incidents, which took place about the time of the Lord's resurrection, as they are brought before us in the statements of all the evangelists together, and let us arrange them in one connected narrative, which will exhibit them, precisely as they may have actually occurred. It was in the early morning of the first day of the week, as all the evangelists are at one in attesting, that the women came to the sepulchre. By that time, all that is recorded by Matthew alone had already taken place; that is to say, in regard to the quaking of the earth, and the rolling away of the stone, and the terror of the guards, with which they were so stricken, that in some part they lay like dead men. Then, as John informs us, came Mary Magdalene, who unquestionably was surpassingly more ardent in her love than these other women[fn-26-P2632_1147978:277-nf] who had ministered to the Lord; so that it was not unreasonable in John to make mention of her alone, leaving those others unnamed, who, however, were along with her, as we gather from the reports given by others of the evangelists. She came accordingly; and when she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre, without pausing to make any more minute investigation, and never doubting but that the body of Jesus had been removed from the tomb, she ran, as the same John states, and told the state of matters to Peter and to John himself. For John is himself that disciple whom Jesus loved. They then set out running to the sepulchre; and John, reaching the spot first, stooped down and saw the linen clothes lying, but he did not go within. But Peter followed up, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, which had been about His head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then John entered also, and saw in like manner, and believed what Mary had told him, namely, that the Lord had been taken away from the sepulchre. \"For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.

We have next to consider now what was the occasion of His first appearance to the disciples in Galilee. For this incident, which John narrates as the third in order, took place in Galilee by the sea of Tiberias. And one may perceive that the scene was in that district, if he calls to mind the miracle of the five loaves, the narrative of which the same John commences in these terms: \"After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.\"[fn-26-P2695_1190070:328-nf] And what should naturally be supposed to be the proper locality for His first manifestation to the disciples after His resurrection but Galilee? This seems to be the conclusion to which we should be led when we recollect the words of the angel who, according to Matthew's Gospel, addressed the women as they came to the sepulchre. The words were these: \"Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I have told you.\"[fn-26-P2696_1190769:329-nf] Mark presents a similar report, whether the angel of whom he speaks be the same one or a different. His version runs thus: \"Be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified; He is risen; He is not here: behold the place where they laid Him. But go your way, tell His disciples and Peter that He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see Him, as He said unto you.\"[fn-26-P2697_1191183:330-nf] Now the impression which these words seem to produce is, that Jesus was not to show Himself to His disciples after His resurrection, but in Galilee. The appearance thus referred to, however, is not recorded even by Mark himself, who has informed us how He showed Himself first to Mary Magdalene in the early morning of the first day of the week; how she went and told them that had been with Him as they mourned and wept; how these persons refused to believe her; how, after this, He was next seen by the two disciples who were going to the residence in the country; how these twain reported what had occurred to them to the residue, which, as Luke and John agree in certifying, took place in Jerusalem on the very day of the Lord's resurrection, and when night was now coming on. Thereafter the same evangelist comes next to that appearance which he calls His last, and which was vouchsafed to the eleven as they sat at meat; and when he has given us his account of that scene, he tells us how He was received up into heaven, which event took place, as we know, on the Mount Olivet, at no great distance from Jerusalem. Thus Mark nowhere relates the actual fulfilment of that which he declares to have been announced beforehand by the angel. Matthew, on the other hand, confines his statement to a single occurrence, and refers to no other locality whatsoever, whether earlier or later, where the disciples saw the Lord after He was risen, but the Galilee which was specified in the angel's prediction. This evangelist, in short, first introduces his notice of the terms in which the women were addressed by the angel; then he subjoins an account of what happened as they were going, and how the members of the watch were bribed to give a false report; and then he inserts his statement [of the appearance in Galilee], just as if that were the very event which followed immediately on what he has been relating. For, indeed, the angel's words, \"He is risen; and behold, He goeth before you into Galilee,\" were really such as might make it seem reasonable to suppose that nothing would intervene [before that manifestation in Galilee]. Matthew's version, accordingly, proceeds as follows: \"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\"[fn-26-P2698_1193905:331-nf] In these terms has Matthew closed his Gospel.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"133","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"79.

But do not imagine that this was because of their high rank: God forbid! it was because of their piety. For that the Scripture mentions their dignified stations, is to show the greatness of their piety; since it is more wonderful when a person being in a position of wealth and power is such as these were. What makes the praise of the former is, his undertaking so long a journey, and this when there was no (festival) season to require it,[fn-9-P953_863129:2-nf] and his reading on his road, and while riding in his chariot, and his beseeching Philip, and numberless other points: and the great praise of the latter is, that he makes alms and prayers, and is a just man, holding such a command. The reason why the writer describes the man so fully, is, that none may say that the Scripture history relates falsehoods: \"Cornelius,\" he says, \"a centurion of the band called the Italian band.\" (v. 1.) A \"band,\" speira, is what we now call a \"numerous.\"[fn-9-P954_864028:3-nf] \"A devout man,\" he says, \"and one that feared God with all his house\" (v. 2): that you may not imagine that it is because of his high station that these things are done.-When Paul was to be brought over, there is no angel, but the Lord Himself: and He does not send him to some great one, but to a very ordinary person:[fn-9-P955_864617:4-nf] but here, on the contrary, He brings the chief Apostle (to these Gentiles), not sends them to him: herein condescending to their weakness, and knowing how such persons need to be treated. As indeed on many occasions we find Christ Himself hasting (to such), as being more infirm. Or (it may be) because (Cornelius) was not able himself to leave his home. But here again is a high commendation of alms, just as was there given by means of Tabitha. \"A devout man,\" it says, \"and one that feared God with all his house.\" Let us hear this, whoever of us neglect them of our own house, whereas this man was careful of his soldiers also. \"And that gave alms,\" it says, \"to all the people.\" Both his doctrines and his life were right. \"He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.\" (v. 3.) Why does he see the angel? This also was in order to the full assurance of Peter, or rather, not of him, but of the others, the weaker ones. \"At the ninth hour,\" when he was released from his cares and was at quiet, when he was engaged in prayers and compunction. \"And when he looked on him, he was afraid.\" (v. 4.) Observe how what the angel speaks he does not speak immediately, but first rouses and elevates his mind. At the sight, there was fear, but a fear in moderation, just so far as served to fix his attention. Then also the words relieved him of his fear. The fear roused him: the praise mitigated what was unpleasant in the fear. \"Thy prayers,\" saith he, \"and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter. (v. 5.) Lest they should come to a different person, he designates the man not only by his surname, but by the place. \"And the same,\" saith he, \"is lodging with one Simon a tanner, who hath his house by the seaside.\" (v. 6.) Do you mark how the Apostles, for love of solitude and quiet, affected the retired quarters of the cities? \"With one Simon a tanner:\" how then if it chanced that there was another? Behold, there is another token, his dwelling by the seaside. All three tokens could not possibly coincide (elsewhere). He does not tell him for what purpose, that he may not take off the intense desire, but he leaves him to an eager and longing expectation of what he shall hear. \"And[fn-9-P956_867590:5-nf] when the Angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.\" (v. 7, 8.) Do you see, that it is not without purpose that the writer says this? (it shows) that those also \"who waited on him continually\" were such as he. \"And when he had declared the whole matter unto them:\" observe the unassuming character of the man: for he does not say, Call Peter to me: but, in order also to induce him to come, he declared the whole matter:-this was so ordered by Providence;-for he did not choose to use the authority of his rank to fetch Peter to him; therefore \"he declared the matter;\" such was the moderation of the man: and yet no great notion was to be formed of one lodging with a tanner. \"And on the morrow, as they journeyed, and drew nigh to the city\" (v. 9.)-observe how the Spirit connects the times: no sooner than this, and no later, He Causes this to take place-\" Peter about the sixth hour went up upon the housetop to pray:\" that is, privately and quietly, as in an upper chamber. \"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, there fell upon him a trance.\" (v. 10.) What means this expression,[fn-9-P957_869034:6-nf] ekstasij, \"trance?\" Rather, there was presented to him a kind of spiritual view (qewria): the soul, so to say, was caused to be out of the body (ecesth). \"And saw heaven opened, and, knit at the four corners, a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.\" (v. 11-16.) What is this? It is a symbol of the whole world. The[fn-9-P958_872580:7-nf] man was uncircumcised: and -for he had nothing in common with the Jews-they would all accuse him as a transgressor: \"thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them: (ch. xi. 3).\" this[fn-9-P959_874271:8-nf] was a thing altogether offensive to them: observe then what is providentially managed. He himself also says, \"I have never eaten:\" not being himself afraid-far be the thought from us-but it is so contrived by the Spirit, in order that he may have it to say in answer to those accusing him, that he did object: for it was altogether necessary for them to observe the Law. He was in the act of being sent to the Gentiles: therefore that these also may not accuse him, see how many things are contrived (by the Providence of God). For, that it may not seem to be a mere fancy, \"this was done thrice. I[fn-9-P960_875843:9-nf] said,\" saith he, \"Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten aught common or unclean.-And the voice came unto him, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\" (ch. xi. 8, with x. 14.) It seems indeed to be spoken to him, but the whole is meant for the Jews. For if the teacher is rebuked, much more these.[fn-9-P961_877128:10-nf] The earth then, this is what the linen sheet denotes, and the wild beasts in it, are they of the Gentiles, and the command, \"Kill and eat,\" denotes that he must go to them also; and that this thing is thrice done, denotes baptism. \"What God hath cleansed,\" saith it, \"call not thou common.\" Great daring! Wherefore[fn-9-P962_879292:11-nf] did he object? That none may say that God was proving him, as in the case of Abraham, this is why he says, \"Not so, Lord,\" etc. not gainsaying-just as to Philip also He said, \"How many loaves have ye?\" Not to learn, but tempting, or \"proving him.\"[fn-9-P963_881091:12-nf] And yet it was the same (Lord) that had discoursed above (in the Law) concerning things clean and unclean. But in that sheet were also all the four-footed beasts of the earth:\" the clean with the unclean. And[fn-9-P964_882302:13-nf] for all this, he knew not what it meant. \"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. But while Peter,\" it says, \"doubted in himself\" (v. 17, 18), the men come at the right moment to solve his doubt: just as (the Lord) suffered Joseph first to be perturbed in mind, and then sends the Angel: for the soul with ease accepts the solution, when it has first been in perplexity. His perplexity neither lasts long (when it did occur), nor (did it occur) before this, but just at the moment when they \"asked whether he were lodging there. While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.\" (supra, p. 142, and 145, note 7; v. 19, 20.) And this again is a plea for Peter in answer to the disciples, that he did doubt, and was instructed to doubt nothing. \"For I,\" saith He, \"have sent them.\" Great is the authority of the Spirit! What God doth, this the Spirit is said to do. Not so the Angel, but having first said, \"Thy prayers and thine alms have ascended, for a memorial before God,\" to show that he is sent from thence, then he adds, \"And now send men,\" etc.: the Spirit not so, but, \"For I have sent them. Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?

They speak his praises, so as to persuade him that an Angel has in fact appeared unto him. \"Then called he them in,\"[fn-9-P965_885560:14-nf] (b) that they may suffer no harm, \"and lodged them:\" thenceforth he without scruple takes his meals with them. \"And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Caesarea accompanied him.

For Jesus was giving a lesson in faith to the woman, who had recognized Him as her Master, and called Him so in her reply; and this gardener was sowing in her heart, as in His own garden, the grain of mustard seed. What then is meant by \"Touch me not\"? And just as if the reason of such a prohibition would be sought, He added, \"for I am not yet ascended to my Father.\" What does this mean? If, while standing on earth, He is not to be touched, how could He be touched by men when sitting in heaven? For certainly, before He ascended, He presented Himself to the touch of the disciples, when He said, as testified by the evangelist Luke, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have;\"[fn-38-P3826_2099284:2-nf] or when He said to Thomas the disciple, \"Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and put forth thy hand, and thrust it into my side.\" And who could be so absurd as to affirm that He was willing indeed to be touched by the disciples before He ascended to the Father, but refused it in the case of women till after His ascension? But no one, even had any the will, was to be allowed to run into such folly. For we read that women also, after His resurrection and before His ascension to the Father, touched Jesus, among whom was Mary Magdalene herself; for it is related by Matthew that Jesus met them, and said, \"All hail. And they approached, and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.\"[fn-38-P3827_2099998:3-nf] This was passed over by John, but declared as the truth by Matthew. It remains, therefore, that some sacred mystery must lie concealed in these words; and whether we discover it or utterly fail to do so, yet we ought to be in no doubt as to its actual existence. Accordingly, either the words, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father,\" had this meaning, that by this woman the Church of the Gentiles was symbolized, which did not believe on Christ till He had actually ascended to the Father, or that in this way Christ wished Himself to be believed on; in other words, to be touched spiritually, that He and the Father are one. For He has in a manner ascended to the Father, to the inward perception of him who has made such progress in the knowledge of Christ that he acknowledges Him as equal with the Father: in any other way He is not rightly touched, that is to say, in any other way He is not rightly believed on. But Mary might have still so believed as to account Him unequal with the Father, and this certainly is forbidden her by the words, \"Touch me not;\" that is, Believe not thus on me according to thy present notions; let not your thoughts stretch outwards to what I have been made in thy behalf, without passing beyond to that whereby thou hast thyself been made. For how could it be otherwise than carnally that she still believed on Him whom she was weeping over as a man? \"For I am not yet ascended,\" He says, \"to my Father:\" there shalt thou touch me, when thou believest me to be God, in no wise unequal with the Father. \"But go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father.\" He saith not, Our Father: in one sense, therefore, is He mine, in another sense, yours; by nature mine, by grace yours. \"And my God, and your God.\" Nor did He say here, Our God: here, therefore, also is He in one sense mine, in another sense yours: my God; under whom I also am as man; your God, between whom and you I am mediator.","title":"Tractate CXXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Then expounding clearly and representing to them, who were being distracted because of the equivocal meaning of loaf and leaven, in an undisguised fashion, that He was not speaking to them about sensible bread but about the leaven in the teaching, He subjoins, \"How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\"[fn-78-P7867_1667783:42-nf] And though He had not laid bare the interpretation, but still continued to use metaphorical language, the disciples would have understood that the discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called leaven, which the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. So long, then, as we have Jesus with us fulfilling the promise which runs, \"Lo, I am with you always unto the consummation of the age,\"[fn-78-P7868_1668211:43-nf] we cannot fast nor be in want of food, so that, because of want of it we should desire to take and eat the forbidden leaven, even from the Pharisees and Sadducees. Now there may sometimes be a time, when He is with us, that we are without food, as is spoken of in the passage above, \"They continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat; \"[fn-78-P7869_1668582:44-nf] but, even though this should happen, being unwilling to send us away fasting lest we faint on the way, He gives thanks over the loaves which were with the disciples, and causes us to have the seven baskets over from the seven loaves, as we have recorded. And moreover this also is to be observed, in view of those who think that the divinity of the Saviour is not at all demonstrable from the Gospel of Matthew, that the fact that, when the disciples were reasoning among themselves and saying, \"We have no loaves,\" Jesus knew their reasonings and said, \"Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves,\"[fn-78-P7870_1669239:45-nf] was beyond the power of man; for the Lord alone, as Solomon says in the third Book of Kings, knows the hearts of men.[fn-78-P7871_1669376:46-nf] But since the disciples understood, when Jesus said, \"Beware of the leaven,\"[fn-78-P7872_1669475:47-nf] that He did not tell them to beware of the loaves but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you will understand that whenever leaven is named it is put figuratively for teaching, whether in the law, or in the Scriptures which come after the law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not right that prayers should take the form of teaching, but should only be supplications of good things from God. But one might inquire, on account of what has been said about disciples who came to the other side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as one of little faith, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what was done by Jesus. But it is not difficult, I think, to say to this, that in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of which \"that which is in part shall be done away,\"[fn-78-P7873_1670341:48-nf] all our faith here is little faith, and in regard to that, we who know in part do not yet know nor remember; for we are not able to obtain a memory which is sufficient and able to attain to the magnitude of the nature of the speculations.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But since some one may think that the promise of the Saviour prescribes a limit of time to their not tasting of death, namely, that they will not taste of death \"until\"[fn-81-P8127_1739363:218-nf] they see the Son of man coming in His own kingdom. but after this will taste of it, let us show that according to the scriptural usage the word \"until\" signifies that the time concerning the thing signified is pressing, but is not so defined that after the \"until,\" that which is contrary to the thing signified should at all take place. Now, the Saviour says to the eleven disciples when He rose from the dead, this among other things, \"Lo, I am with you all the days, even until the consummation of the age.\"[fn-81-P8128_1739896:219-nf] When He said this, did He promise that He was going to be with them until the consummation of the age, but that after the consummation of the age, when another age was at hand, which is \"called the age to come,\" He would be no longer with them?-so that according to this, the condition of the disciples would be better before the consummation of the age than after the consummation of the age? But I do not think that any one will dare to say, that after the consummation of the age the Son of God will be no longer with the disciples, because the expression declares that He will be with them for so long, until the consummation of the age is at hand; for it is clear that the matter under inquiry was, whether the Son of God was forthwith going to be with His disciples before the age to come and the hoped for promises of God which were given as a recompense. But there might have been a question-it being granted that He would be with them-whether sometimes He was present with them, and sometimes not present. Wherefore setting us free from the suspicion that might have arisen from doubt, He declared that now and even all the days He would be with the disciples, and that He would not leave those who had become His disciples until the consummation of the age; (because He said \"all the days\" He did not deny that by night, when the sun set, He would be present with them.) But if such is the force of the words, \"until the consummation of the age,\" plainly we shall not be compelled to admit that those who see the Son of man coming in His own kingdom shall taste of death, after being deemed worthy of beholding Him in such guise. But as in the case of the passage we brought forward, the urgent necessity was to teach us that \"until the consummation of the age\" He would not leave us but be with us all the days; so also in this case I think that it is clear to those who know how to look at the logical coherence of things that He who has seen once for all \"the Son of man coming in His own kingdom,\" and seen Him \"in His own glory,\" and seen \"the kingdom of God come with power,\" could not possibly taste of death after the contemplation of things so good and great. But apart from the word of the promise of Jesus, we have conjectured not without reason that we would taste of death, so long as we were not yet held worthy to see \"the kingdom of God come with power,\" and \"the Son of man coming in His own glory and in His own kingdom.\"","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":" 8.

To-day He is baptized by John that He might cleanse him who was defiled, that He might bring the Spirit from above, and exalt man to heaven, that he who had fallen might be raised up and he who had cast him down might be put to shame. And marvel not if God showed so great earnestness in our cause: for it was with care on the part of him who did us wrong that the plot was laid against us; it is with forethought on the part of our Maker that we are saved. And he, that evil charmer, framing his new device of sin against our race, drew along his serpent train, a disguise worthy of his own intent, entering in his impurity into what was like himself,-dwelling, earthly and mundane as he was in will, in that creeping thing. But Christ, the repairer of his evil-doing, assumes manhood in its fulness, and saves man, and becomes the type and figure of us all, to sanctify the first-fruits of every action, and leave to His servants no doubt in their zeal for the tradition. Baptism, then, is a purification from sins, a remission of trespasses, a cause of renovation and regeneration. By regeneration, understand regeneration conceived in thought, not discerned by bodily sight For we shall not, according to the Jew Nicodemus and his somewhat dull intelligence, change the old man into a child, nor shall we form anew him who is wrinkled and gray-headed to tenderness and youth, if we bring back the man again into his mother's womb: but we do bring back, by royal grace, him who bears the scars of sin, and has grown old in evil habits, to the innocence of the babe. For as the child new-born is free from accusations and from penalties, so too the child of regeneration has nothing for which to answer, being released by royal bounty from accountability[fn-41-P4156_2745608:4-nf] . And this gift it is not the water that bestows (for in that case it were a thing more exalted than all creation), but the command of God, and the visitation of the Spirit that comes sacramentally to set us free. But water serves to express the cleansing. For since we are wont by washing in water to render our body clean when it is soiled by dirt or mud, we therefore apply it also in the sacramental action, and display the spiritual brightness by that which is subject to our senses. Let us however, if it seems well, persevere in enquiring more fully and more minutely concerning Baptism, starting, as from the fountain-head, from the Scriptural declaration, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God[fn-41-P4157_2746508:5-nf] .\" Why are both named, and why is not the Spirit alone accounted sufficient for the completion of Baptism? Man, as we know full well, is compound, not simple: and therefore the cognate and similar medicines are assigned for healing to him who is twofold and conglomerate:-for his visible body, water, the sensible element,-for his soul, which we cannot see, the Spirit invisible, invoked by faith, present unspeakably. For \"the Spirit breathes where He wills, and thou hearest His voice, but canst not tell whence He cometh or whither He goeth[fn-41-P4158_2747071:6-nf] .\" He blesses the body that is baptized, and the water that baptizes. Despise not, therefore, the Divine laver, nor think lightly of it, as a common thing, on account of the use of water. For the power that operates is mighty, and wonderful are the things that are wrought thereby. For this holy altar, too, by which I stand, is stone, ordinary in its nature, nowise different from the other slabs of stone that build our houses and adorn our pavements; but seeing that it was consecrated to the service of God, and received the benediction, it is a holy table, an altar undefiled, no longer touched by the hands of all, but of the priests alone, and that with reverence. The bread again is at first[fn-41-P4159_2747790:7-nf] common bread, but when the sacramental action consecrates it, it is called, and becomes, the Body of Christ. So with the sacramental oil; so with the wine: though before the benediction they are of little value, each of them, after the sanctification bestowed by the Spirit, has its several operation. The same power of the word, again, also makes the priest venerable and honourable, separated, by the new blessing bestowed upon him, from his community with the mass of men. While but yesterday he was one of the mass, one of the people, he is suddenly rendered a guide, a president, a teacher of righteousness, an instructor in hidden mysteries; and this he does[fn-41-P4160_2748494:8-nf] without being at all changed in body or in form; but, while continuing to be in all appearance the man he was before, being, by some unseen power and grace, transformed in respect of his unseen soul to the higher condition. And so there are many things, which if you consider you will see that their appearance is contemptible, but the things they accomplish are mighty: and this is especially the case when you collect from the ancient history[fn-41-P4161_2748981:9-nf] instances cognate and similar to the subject of our inquiry. The rod of Moses was a hazel wand. And what is that, but common wood that every hand cuts and carries, and fashions to what use it chooses, and casts as it will into the fire? But when God was pleased to accomplish by that rod those wonders, lofty, and passing the power of language to express, the wood was changed into a serpent. And again, at another time, he smote the waters, and now made the water blood, now made to issue forth a countless brood of frogs: and again he divided the sea, severed to its depths without flowing together again. Likewise the mantle of one of the prophets, though it was but a goat's skin, made Elisha renowned in the whole world. And the wood of the Cross is of saving efficacy[fn-41-P4162_2749801:10-nf] for all men, though it is, as I am informed, a piece of a poor tree, less valuable than most trees are. So a bramble bush showed to Moses the manifestation of the presence of God: so the remains of Elisha raised a dead man to life; so clay gave sight to him that was blind from the womb. And all these things, though they were matter without soul or sense, were made the means for the performance of the great marvels wrought by them, when they received the power of God. Now by a similar train of reasoning, water also, though it is nothing else than water, renews the man to spiritual regeneration[fn-41-P4163_2751008:11-nf] , when the grace from above hallows it. And if any one answers me again by raising a difficulty, with his questions and doubts, continually asking and inquiring how water and the sacramental act that is performed therein regenerate, I most justly reply to him, \"Show me the mode of that generation which is after the flesh, and I will explain to you the power of regeneration in the soul.\" You will say perhaps, by way of giving an account of the matter, \"It is the cause of the seed which makes the man.\" Learn then from us in return, that hallowed water cleanses and illuminates the man. And if you again object to me your \"How?\" I shall more vehemently cry in answer, \"How does the fluid and formless substance become a man?\" and so the argument as it advances will be exercised on everything through all creation. How does heaven exist? how earth? how sea? how every single thing? For everywhere men's reasoning, perplexed in the attempt at discovery, falls back upon this syllable \"how,\" as those who cannot walk fall back upon a seat. To speak concisely, everywhere the power of God and His operation are incomprehensible and incapable of being reduced to rule, easily producing whatever He wills, while concealing from us the minute knowledge of His operation. Hence also the blessed David, applying his mind to the magnificence of creation, and filled with perplexed wonder in his soul, spake that verse which is sung by all, \"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works: in wisdom hast Thou made them all[fn-41-P4164_2752645:12-nf] .\" The wisdom he perceived: but the art of the wisdom he could not discover. Let us then leave the task of searching into what is beyond human power, and seek rather that which shows signs of being partly within our comprehension:-what is the reason why the cleansing is effected by water? and to what purpose are the three immersions received? That which the fathers taught, and which our mind has received and assented to, is as follows:-We recognize four elements, of which the world is composed, which every one knows even if their names are not spoken; but if it is well, for the sake of the more simple, to tell you their names, they are fire and air, earth and water. Now our God and Saviour, in fulfilling the Dispensation for our sakes, went beneath the fourth of these, the earth, that He might raise up life from thence. And we in receiving Baptism, in imitation of our Lord and Teacher and Guide, are not indeed buried in the earth (for this is the shelter of the body that is entirely dead, covering the infirmity and decay of our nature), but coming to the element akin to earth, to water, we conceal ourselves in that as the Saviour did in the earth: and by doing this thrice we represent for ourselves that grace of the Resurrection which was wrought in three days: and this we do, not receiving the sacrament in silence, but while there are spoken over us the Names of the Three Sacred Persons on Whom we believed, in Whom we also hope, from Whom comes to us both the fact of our present and the fact of our future existence. It may be thou art offended, thou who contendest boldly against the glory of the Spirit, and that thou grudgest to the Spirit that veneration wherewith He is reverenced by the godly. Leave off contending with me: resist, if thou canst, those words of the Lord which gave to men the rule of the Baptismal invocation. What says the Lord's command? \"Baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost[fn-41-P4165_2754787:13-nf] .\" How in the Name of the Father? Because He is the primal cause of all things. How in the Name of the Son? Because He is the Maker of the Creation. How in the Name of the Holy Ghost? Because He is the power perfecting all. We bow ourselves therefore before the Father, that we may be sanctified: before the Son also we bow, that the same end may be fulfilled: we bow also before the Holy Ghost, that we may be made what He is in fact and in Name. There is not a distinction in the sanctification, in the sense that the Father sanctifies more, the Son less, the Holy Spirit in a less degree than the other Two. Why then dost thou divide the Three Persons into fragments of different natures, and make Three Gods, unlike one to another, whilst from all thou dost receive one and the same grace?

Ebion's is a Council of vanity since he teaches that, while we believe in Christ, we are withal to observe the circumcision of the flesh, the keeping of the Sabbath, the accustomed sacrifices, and all the other ordinances according to the letter of the Law. Manichaeus' is a Council of vanity in regard of his teaching; first in that he calls himself the Paraclete, then that he says that the world was made by an evil God, denies God the Creator, rejects the Old Testament, asserts two natures, one good the other evil, mutually opposing one another, affirms that men's souls are co-eternal with God, that, according to the Pythagoreans, they return through divers circles of nativity into cattle and animals and beasts, denies the resurrection of our flesh, maintains that the passion and nativity of the Lord were not in the verity of flesh, but only in appearance. It was the Council of vanity when Paul of Samosata and his successor Photinus afterwards taught, that Christ was not born of the Father before the world, but had His beginning from Mary, and believed not that being God He was born man, but that of man He was made God. It was the Council of vanity when Arius and Eunomius taught as their determinate opinion that the Son of God was not born of the very substance of the Father, but was created out of nothing, and that the Son of God had a beginning, and is inferior to the Father: moreover they affirm that the Holy Ghost is not only inferior to the Son, but is also a ministering Spirit.[fn-98-P9858_2775271:153-nf] Theirs also is a Council of vanity who confess indeed that the Son is of the substance of the Father, but distinguish and separate the Holy Spirit, while yet the Saviour shews in the Gospel that the power and Godhead of the Trinity are one and the same, saying, \"Baptize all nations in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-98-P9859_2775953:154-nf] and it is plainly impious for man to put asunder what God bath joined together. That also is the Council of vanity which a pertinacious and wicked contention formerly gathered together, affirming that Christ assumed human flesh indeed, but not a rational soul withal, since Christ conferred one and the same salvation on the flesh, and the animal soul, and the reason and mind of man. That also is the Council of vanity which Donatus drew together throughout Africa, by charging the Church with traditorship (delivering up the sacred books), and with which Novatus disturbed men's minds by denying the grant of repentance to the lapsed, and condemning second marriages, though contracted possibly of necessity. All of these then avoid as congregations of malignants. Those also, if such there be, who are said to assert that the Son of God does not see or know the Father, as Himself is known and seen by the Father; or that the kingdom of Christ will have an end; or that the flesh will not be raised in the complete restoration of its substance; these also who deny that there will be a just judgment of God in respect of all, and affirm that the devil will be absolved from the punishment of damnation due to him. To all these, I say, let the believer turn a deaf ear. But hold fast by the holy Church, which confesses God the Father Almighty, and His only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, and the Holy Ghost, of one concordant and harmonious substance, believes that the Son of God was born of the Virgin, suffered for man's salvation, rose again from the dead in the same flesh in which he was born; and, lastly, hopes that He will come the Judge of all, through Whom also both the Forgiveness of Sins and the Resurrection of the Flesh are preached.","title":"A Commentary on the Apostles' Creed.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Why, then, should we hesitate to say what Scripture does not shrink from declaring?

Why, then, should man hesitate to call Christ God, when he observes that He is declared to be God by the Father according to the Scriptures? Yea, if God the Father does not save except by God, no one can be saved by God the Father unless he shall have confessed Christ to be God, in whom and by whom the Father promises that He will give him salvation: so that, reasonably, whoever acknowledges Him to be God, may find salvation in Christ God; whoever does not acknowledge Him to be God, would lose salvation which he could not find elsewhere than in Christ God. For in the same way as Isaiah says, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and ye shall call His name Emmanuel, which is, interpreted, God with us; \"[fn-102-P10202_3179686:76-nf] so Christ Himself says, \"Lo, I am with you, even to the consummation of the world.\"[fn-102-P10203_3179790:77-nf] Therefore He is\" God with us; \"yea, and much rather, He is in us.

But because He is with us He was called Emmanuel, that is, God with us. God, therefore, because He is with us, was called God with us, The same prophet says: \"Be ye strengthened, ye relaxed hands, and ye feeble knees; be consoled, ye that are cowardly in heart; be strong; fear not.

For, being bound by the words of the prophets, they can no longer deny Christ to be God. What, then, do they reply when those signs are said to be about to take place on the advent of God, which were manifested on the advent of Christ? In what way do they receive Christ as God? For now they cannot deny Him to be God. As God the Father, or as God the Son? If as the Son, why do they deny that the Son of God is God? If as the Father, why do they not follow those who appear to maintain blasphemies of that kind? unless because in this contest against them concerning the truth, this is in the meantime sufficient for us, that, being convinced in any kind of way, they should confess Christ to be God, seeing they have even wished to deny that He is God. He says by Habakkuk the prophet: \"God shall come from the south, and the Holy One from the dark and dense mountain.\"[fn-102-P10205_3181889:79-nf] Whom do they wish to represent as coming from the south? If they say that it is the Almighty God the Father, then God the Father comes from a place, from which place, moreover, He is thus excluded, and He is bounded within the straitnesses of some abode; and thus by such as these, as we have said, the sacrilegious heresy of Sabellius is embodied. Since Christ is believed to be not the Son, but the Father; since by them He is asserted to be in strictness a bare man, in a new manner, by those, again, Christ is proved to be God the Father Almighty. But if in Bethlehem, the region of which local division looks towards the southern portion of heaven, Christ is born, who by the Scriptures is also said to be God, this God is rightly described as coming from the south, because He was foreseen as about to come from Bethlehem. Let them, then, choose of the two alternatives, the one that they prefer, that He who came from the south is the Son, or the Father; for God is said to be about to come from the south. If the Son, why do they shrink from calling Him Christ and God? For the Scripture says that God shall come. If the Father, why do they shrink from being associated with the boldness of Sabellius, who says that Christ is the Father? unless because, whether they call Him Father or Son, from his heresy, however unwillingly, they must needs withdraw if they are accustomed to say that Christ is merely man; when compelled by the facts themselves, they are on the eve of exalting Him as God, whether in wishing to call Him Father or in wishing to call Him Son.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_45_oration_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"IV.

And this opinion had prevailed also extensively among the Jews; for which reason it is related that Herod, on inquiring at the chief priests and scribes of the people, heard from them that the Christ was to be born in Bethlehem of Judea, \"whence David was.\" It is stated also in the Gospel according to John, that the Jews declared that the Christ was to be born in Bethlehem, \"whence David was.\"[fn-78-P7888_1893780:96-nf] But after our Lord's coming, those who busied themselves with overthrowing the belief that the place of His birth had been the subject of prophecy from the beginning, withheld such teaching from the people; acting in a similar manner to those individuals who won over those soldiers of the guard stationed around the tomb who had seen Him arise from the dead, and who instructed these eye-witnesses to report as follows: \"Say that His disciples, while we slept, came and stole Him away. And if this come to the governor's ears, we shall persuade him, and secure you.\"[fn-78-P7889_1894371:97-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_27_circular_letter","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Our sufferings have been dreadful beyond endurance, and it is impossible to describe them in suitable terms; but in order that the dreadful nature of the events which have taken place may be more readily apprehended, I have thought it good to remind you of a history out of the Scriptures. It happened that a certain Levite[fn-25-P2524_944572:1-nf] was injured in the person of his wife; and, when he considered the exceeding greatness of the pollution (for the woman was a Hebrew, and of the tribe of Judah), being astounded at the outrage which had been committed against him, he divided his wife's body, as the Holy Scripture relates in the Book of Judges, and sent a part of it to every tribe in Israel, in order that it might be understood that an injury like this pertained not to himself only, but extended to all alike; and that, if the people sympathised with him in his sufferings, they might avenge him; or if they neglected to do so, might bear the disgrace of being considered thenceforth as themselves guilty of the wrong. The messengers whom he sent related what had happened; and they that heard and saw it, declared that such things had never been done from the day that the children of Israel came up out of Egypt. So every tribe of Israel was moved, and all came together against the offenders, as though they had themselves been the sufferers; and at last the perpetrators of this iniquity were destroyed in war, and became a curse in the mouths of all: for the assembled people considered not their kindred blood, but regarded only the crime they had committed. You know the history, brethren, and the particular account of the circumstances given in Scripture. I will not therefore describe them more in detail, since I write to persons acquainted with them, and as I am anxious to represent to your piety our present circumstances, which are even worse than those to which I have referred. For my object in reminding you of this history is this, that you may compare those ancient transactions with what has happened to us now, and perceiving how much these last exceed the other in cruelty, may be filled with greater indignation on account of them, than were the people of old against those offenders. For the treatment we have undergone surpasses the bitterness of any persecution; and the calamity of the Levite was but small, when compared with the enormities which have now been committed against the Church; or rather such deeds as these were never before heard of in the whole world, or the like experienced by any one. For in that case it was but a single woman that was injured, and one Levite who suffered wrong; Now the whole Church is injured, the priesthood insulted, and worst of all, piety[fn-25-P2525_946969:2-nf] is persecuted by impiety. On that occasion the tribes were astounded, each at the sight of part of the body of one woman; but now the members of the whole Church are seen divided from one another, and are sent abroad some to you, and some to others, bringing word of the insults and injustice which they have suffered. Be ye therefore also moved, I beseech you, considering that these wrongs are done unto you no less than unto us; and let every one lend his aid, as feeling that he is himself a sufferer, lest shortly ecclesiastical Canons, and the faith of the Church be corrupted. For both are in danger, unless God shall speedily by your hands amend what has been done amiss, and the Church be avenged on her enemies. For our Canons[fn-25-P2526_947752:3-nf] and our forms were not given to the Churches at the present day, but were wisely and safely transmitted to us from our forefathers. Neither had our faith its beginning at this time, but it came down to us from the Lord through His disciples[fn-25-P2527_948144:4-nf] . That therefore the ordinances which have been preserved in the Churches from old time until now, may not be lost in our days, and the trust which has been committed to us required at our hands; rouse yourselves, brethren, as being stewards of the mysteries of God[fn-25-P2528_948472:5-nf] , and seeing them now seized upon by others. Further particulars of our condition you will learn from the bearers of our letters; but I was anxious myself to write you a brief account thereof, that you may know for certain, that such things have never before been committed against the Church, from the day that our Saviour when He was taken up, gave command to His disciples, saying, `Go ye and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost[fn-25-P2529_948994:6-nf] .'","title":"Circular Letter","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-04","text":"[fn-80-P8052_1968913:27-nf] is considered to be a god when speaking, and making himself heard through the Pythian priestess; so, according to our view, it was the Logos God, and Son of the God of all things, who spake in Jesus these words, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; \"and these, \"I am the door; \"and these, \"I am the living bread that came down from heaven; \"and other expressions similar to these. We therefore charge the Jews with not acknowledging Him to be God, to whom testimony was borne in many passages by the prophets, to the effect that He was a mighty power, and a God next to[fn-80-P8053_1969517:28-nf] the God and Father of all things. For we assert that it was to Him the Father gave the command, when in the Mosaic account of the creation He uttered the words, \"Let there be light,\" and \"Let there be a firmament,\" and gave the injunctions with regard to those other creative acts which were performed; and that to Him also were addressed the words, \"Let Us make man in Our own image and likeness; \"and that the Logos, when commanded, obeyed all the Father's will. And we make these statements not from our own conjectures, but because we believe the prophecies circulated among the Jews, in which it is said of God, and of the works of creation, in express words, as follows: \"He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.\"[fn-80-P8054_1971146:29-nf] Now if God gave the command, and the creatures were formed, who, according to the view of the spirit of prophecy, could He be that was able to carry out such commands of the Father, save Him who, so to speak, is the living Logos and the Truth? And that the Gospels do not consider him who in Jesus said these words, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life,\" to have been of so circumscribed a nature[fn-80-P8055_1971570:30-nf] as to have an existence nowhere out of the soul and body of Jesus, is evident both from many considerations, and from a few instances of the following kind which we shall quote. John the Baptist, when predicting that the Son of God was to appear immediately, not in that body and soul, but as manifesting Himself everywhere, says regarding Him: \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not, who cometh after me.\"[fn-80-P8056_1972020:31-nf] For if he had thought that the Son of God was only there, where was the visible body of Jesus, how could he have said, \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not? \"And Jesus Himself, in raising the minds of His disciples to higher thoughts of the Son of God, says: \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of you.\"[fn-80-P8057_1972401:32-nf] And of the same nature is His promise to His disciples: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8058_1972536:33-nf] And we quote these passages, making no distinction between the Son of God and Jesus. For the soul and body of Jesus formed, after the oi0konomi/a, one being with the Logos of God. Now if, according to Paul's teaching, \"he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit,\"[fn-80-P8059_1972826:34-nf] every one who understands what being joined to the Lord is, and who has been actually joined to Him, is one spirit with the Lord; how should not that being be one in a far greater and more divine degree, which was once united with the Logos of God?[fn-80-P8060_1973095:35-nf] He, indeed, manifested Himself among the Jews as the power of God, by the miracles which He performed, which Celsus suspected were accomplished by sorcery, but which by the Jews of that time were attributed I know not why, to Beelzebub, in the words \"He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.\"[fn-80-P8061_1973696:36-nf] But these our Saviour convicted of uttering the greatest absurdities, from the fact that the kingdom of evil was not yet come to an end.

Each man receives after the fashion of his own faith; yet how much does he obtain under the guidance of that mercy of God, in the confident assurance of which the same apostle says, \"If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you\"?[fn-33-P3353_1927971:33-nf] Yet the snares of heretics and schismatics prove for this reason only too pernicious to the carnally-minded, because their very progress is intercepted when their vain opinions are confirmed in opposition to the Catholic truth, and the perversity of their dissension is strengthened against the Catholic peace.

Nor can this question be solved except we acknowledge, that there are some sins in brethren that are worse than the sin of enemies in persecuting. That \"brethren\" mean Christians, may be proved by many texts of Holy Writ; the plainest, however, is that of the apostle which he puts thus: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.\"[fn-47-P4705_2527848:64-nf] For he has not added our; but thought it plain enough, when by the term brother he spake of the Christian that should have an unbelieving wife. And accordingly he says just afterwards, \"But if the unbelieving depart, let her depart: but a brother or sister is not put under servitude in a matter of this sort.\" The \"sin,\" therefore, of a brother, \"unto death,\" I suppose to be when, after the acknowledging of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, one fights against the brotherhood, and is set on by the fire-brands of hatred[fn-47-P4706_2528408:65-nf] against the very grace through which he was reconciled to God.[fn-47-P4707_2528496:66-nf] But \"a sin not unto death\" is when a person, not having alienated his love from his brother. yet through some infirmity of mind may have failed to exhibit the due offices of brotherhood.

Not that to him who repenteth there is to be no forgiveness: lest we go against that sentence of the Lord, in which He commands always to forgive the brother who asks his brother's forgiveness:[fn-47-P4712_2531135:71-nf] but that the mischief of that sin is, that the man cannot submit to the humiliation of begging for pardon, even when he is forced by his evil conscience both to acknowledge and to publish his sin. For when Judas had said, \"I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood,\"[fn-47-P4713_2531442:72-nf] he went and hanged himself in desperation, rather than pray for forgiveness in humiliation. Wherefore it makes a great difference, what sort of repentance God forgives. For many are much quicker than others to confess that they have sinned, and are angry with themselves in such sort that they vehemently wish they had not sinned, while yet they cannot lay down their pride, and submit to have the heart humbled and broken so as to implore pardon: a state of mind which one may well believe to be, for the greatness of their sin, a part of their already begun damnation.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_60_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"ANF-04","text":"God accordingly, in His kindness, condescends to mankind, not in any local sense, but through His providence;[fn-98-P9858_2572481:45-nf] while the Son of God, not only (when on earth), but at all times, is with His own disciples, fulfilling the promise, \"Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-98-P9859_2572675:46-nf] And if a branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine, it is evident that the disciples also of the Word, who are the rational branches of the Word's true vine, cannot produce the fruits of virtue unless they abide in the true vine, the Christ of God, who is with us locally here below upon the earth, and who is with those who cleave to Him in all parts of the world, and is also in all places with those who do not know Him.

I Observe that it has been asked among the brethren what course ought specially to be adopted towards the persons of those who, although baptized in heresy, have yet been baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,[fn-107-P10722_3373880:1-nf] and subsequently departing from their heresy, and fleeing as supplicants to the Church of God, should repent with their whole hearts, and only now perceiving the condemnation of their error, implore from the Church the help of salvation. The point is whether, according to the most ancient custom and ecclesiastical tradition, it would suffice, after that baptism which they have received outside the Church indeed, but still in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, that only hands should be laid upon them by the bishop for their reception of the Holy Spirit, and this imposition of hands would afford them the renewed and perfected seal of faith; or whether, indeed, a repetition of baptism would be necessary for them, as if they should receive nothing if they had not obtained baptism afresh, just as if they were never baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And therefore some things were talked about as having been written and replied on this new question, wherein both sides endeavoured with the greatest eagerness to demolish what had been written by their antagonists. In which kind of debate, as it appears to me, no controversy or discussion could have arisen at all if each one of us had been content with the venerable authority of all the churches,[fn-107-P10723_3375224:2-nf] and with becoming humility had desired to innovate nothing, as observing no kind of room for contradiction. For everything which is both doubtful and ambiguous, and is established in opinions differing among those of prudent and faithful men, if it is judged to be against the ancient and memorable and most solemn observance of all those holy and faithful men who have deserved well, ought assuredly to be condemned; since in a matter once arranged and ordained, whatever that is which is brought forward against the quiet and peace of the Church, will result in nothing but discords, and strifes, and schisms. And in this no other fruit can be found but this alone; that one man, whoever he is, should be vain-gloriously declared among certain fickle men to be of great prudence and constancy: and, being gifted with the arrogance of heretics, whose only consolation in destruction is the not appearing to sin alone, should be renowned among those that are most similar and agreeable to himself, as having corrected the errors and vices of all the churches. For this is the desire and purpose of all heretics, to frame as many calumnies of this kind as possible against our most holy mother the Church, and to deem it a great glory to have discovered anything that can be imputed to her as a crime, or even as a folly. And since it becomes no faithful man of sound mind to dare to hold such a view, especially no one who is ordained in any clerical office at all, and much more in the episcopal order, it is like a prodigy for bishops themselves to devise such scandals, and not to fear to unfold too irreverently against the precept of the law and of all the Scriptures, with their own disgrace and risk, the disgrace of their mother the Church-if they think that there is any disgrace in this matter; although the Church has no disgrace in this instance, save in the error of such men as these themselves. Therefore it is the more grievous sin in men of this kind, if that which is blamed by them in the most ancient observance, as if it were not rightly done, is manifestly and forcibly shown as well to have been rightly observed by those who were before us, as to be rightly observed also by us; so that even if we should engage in the controversy with equal arguments on both sides, yet, since that which was innovated could not be established without dissension among the brethren and mischief to the Church, assuredly it ought not,-right or wrong, as they say, that is, contrary to what is good and proper-rashly to be flung like a stain upon our mother the Church; and the ignominy of this audacity and impiety ought with reason to be attached to those who should attempt this. But since it is not in our power, according to the apostle's precept, \"to speak the same thing, that there be not schisms among us; \"[fn-107-P10724_3378162:3-nf] yet, as far as we can, we strive to demonstrate the true condition of this argument, and to persuade turbulent men, even now, to mind their own business, as we shall even attain a great deal if they will at length acquiesce in this sound advice.[fn-107-P10725_3378425:4-nf] And therefore we shall, as is needful, collect into one mass whatever passages of the Holy Scriptures are pertinent to this subject. And we shall manifestly harmonize, as far as possible, those which seem to be differing or of various meaning; and we shall to the extent of our poor ability examine both the utility and advantage of each method, that we may recommend to all the brethren, that the most wholesome form and peaceful custom be adopted in the Church.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_148_a_treatise_on_re_baptism_by_an_anonymous_writer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"7.

Otherwise such an invocation would not avail if it should remain alone, because after the death of a man in this position there cannot be added to him anything at all, nor supplemented, nor can, in anything, avail him in the day of judgment, when they shall begin to be reproached by our Lord with those things which we have above mentioned, none of whom notwithstanding in this present time may by any man be so hardly and cruelly prohibited from aiding themselves in those ways which we have above shown.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_54_letter_li_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"11.

For besides the weight of custom which we know rests upon the Apostles' teaching, Holy Writ also makes this clear, because when the Apostles sent Paul and Barnabas at the bidding of the Holy Ghost to preach the gospel to the nations, they laid hands on them fasting and praying: that we may know with what devoutness both giver and receiver must be on their guard lest so blessed a sacrament should seem to be carelessly performed.

On it the world took its beginning. On it through the resurrection of Christ death received its destruction, and life its commencement.

Here then all points but one are satisfactorily and exactly defined, some for the correction of what had been corrupted, some as a precaution against errors expected to arise. The doctrine of the Spirit, however, is merely mentioned, as needing no elaboration, because at the time of the Council no question was mooted, and the opinion on this subject in the hearts of the faithful was exposed to no attack. Little by little, however, the growing poison-germs of impiety, first sown by Arius, the champion of the heresy, and then by those who succeeded to his inheritance of mischief, were nurtured to the plague of the Church, and the regular development of the impiety issued in blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. Under these circumstances we are under the necessity of putting before the men who have no pity for themselves, and shut their eyes to the inevitable threat directed by our Lord against blasphemers of the Holy Ghost, their bounden duty. They must anathematize all who call the Holy Ghost a creature, and all who so think; all who do not confess that He is holy by nature, as the Father is holy by nature, and the Son is holy by nature, and refuse Him His place in the blessed divine nature. Our not separating Him from Father and Son is a proof of our right mind, for we are bound to be baptized in the terms we have received and to profess belief in the terms in which we are baptized, and as we have professed belief in, so to give glory to Father, on, and Holy Ghost; and to hold aloof from the communion of all who call Him creature, as from open blasphemers. One point must be regarded as settled; and the remark is necessary because of our slanderers; we do not speak of the Holy Ghost as unbegotten, for we recognise one Unbegotten and one Origin of all things,[fn-40-P4086_1307440:8-nf] the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: nor do we speak of the Holy Ghost as begotten, for by the tradition of the faith we have been taught one Only-begotten: the Spirit of truth we have been taught to proceed from the Father, and we confess Him to be of God without creation.We are also bound to anathematize all who speak of the Holy Ghost as ministerial,[fn-40-P4087_1307825:9-nf] inasmuch as by this term they degrade Him to the rank of a creature. For that the ministering spirits are creatures we are told by Scripture in the words \"they are all ministering spirits sent forth to minister.\"[fn-40-P4088_1308492:10-nf] But because of men who make universal confusion, and do not keep the doctrine of the Gospels, it is necessary to add yet this further, that they are to be shunned, as plainly hostile to true religion, who invert the order left us by the Lord, and put the Son before the Father, and the Holy Spirit before the Son.

And what shall we state, or what shall we pass by here? or who shall explain what is incomprehensible in the mystery? But for the present let us fall back upon our subject. Gabriel was sent to the holy virgin; the incorporeal was despatched to her who in the body pursued the incorruptible conversation, and lived in purity and in virtues. And when he came to her, he first addressed her with the salutation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured! the Lord is with thee.\" Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for thou doest what is worthy of joy indeed, since thou hast put on the vesture of purity, and art girt with the cincture of prudence. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for to thy lot it has fallen to be the vehicle of celestial joy. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for through thee joy is decreed for the whole creation, and the human race receives again by thee its pristine dignity. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for in thy arms the Creator of all things shall be carried. And she was perplexed by this word; for she was inexperienced in all the addresses of men, and welcomed quiet, as the mother of prudence and purity; (yet) being a pure, and immaculate, and stainless image[fn-11-P1199_299997:10-nf] herself, she shrank not in terror from the angelic apparition, like most of the prophets, as indeed true virginity has a kind of affinity and equality with the angels. For the holy Virgin guarded carefully the torch of virginity, and gave diligent heed that it should not be extinguished or defiled. And as one who is clad in a brilliant robe deems it a matter of great moment that no impurity or filth be suffered to touch it anywhere, so did the holy Mary consider with herself, and said: Does this act of attention imply any deep design or seductive purpose? Shall this word \"Hail\" prove the cause of trouble to me, as of old the fair promise of being made like God, which was given her by the serpent-devil, proved to our first mother Eve? Has the devil, who is the author of all evil, become transformed again into an angel of light; and bearing a grudge against my espoused husband for his admirable temperance, and having assailed him with some fair-seeming address, and finding himself powerless to overcome a mind so firm, and to deceive the man, has he turned his attack upon me, as one endowed with a more susceptible mind; and is this word \"Hail\" (Grace be with thee) spoken as the sign of gracelessness hereafter? Is this benediction and salutation uttered in irony? Is there not some poison concealed in the honey? Is it not the address of one who brings good tidings, while the end of the same is to make me the designer's prey? And how is it that he can thus salute one whom he knows not? These things she pondered in perplexity with herself, and expressed in words. Then again the archangel addressed her with the announcement of a joy which all may believe in, and which shall not be taken away, and said to her, \"Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.\" Shortly hast thou the proof of what has been said. For I not only give yon to understand that there is nothing to fear, but I show you the very key to the absence of all cause for fear. For through me all the heavenly powers hail thee, the holy virgin: yea rather, He Himself, who is Lord of all the heavenly powers and of all creation, has selected thee as the holy one and the wholly fair; and through thy holy, and chaste, and pure, and undefiled womb the enlightening Pearl comes forth for the salvation of all the world: since of all the race of man thou art by birth the holy one, and the more honourable, and the purer, and the more pious than any other: and thou hast a mind whiter than the snow, and a body made purer than any gold, however fine, and a womb such as the object which Ezekiel saw, and which he has described in these terms: \"And the likeness of the living creatures upon the head was as the firmament, and as the appearance of the terrible crystal, and the likeness of the throne above them was as the appearance of a sapphire-stone: and above the throne it was as the likeness of a man, and as the appearance of amber; and within it there was, as it were, the likeness of fire round about.\"[fn-12-P1200_303014:11-nf] ","title":"The Second Homily","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":28,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_60_letter_xvii_to_eustathia_ambrosia_and_basilissa_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"There are indeed two limits of human life: the one we start from, and the one we end in: and so it was necessary that the Physician of our being should enfold us at both these extremities, and grasp not only the end, but the beginning too, in order to secure in both the raising of the sufferer. That, then, which we find to have happened on the side of the finish we conclude also as to the beginning. As at the end He caused by virtue of the Incarnation that, though the body was disunited from the soul, yet the indivisible Godhead which had been blended once for all with the subject (who possessed them) was not stripped from that body any more than it was from that soul, but while it was in Paradise along with the soul, and paved an entrance there in the person of the Thief for all humanity, it remained by means of the body in the heart of the earth, and therein destroyed him that had the power of Death (wherefore His body too is called \"the Lord[fn-43-P4394_2874313:11-nf] \" on account of that inherent Godhead)-so also, at the beginning, we conclude that the power of the Highest, coalescing with our entire nature by that coming upon (the Virgin) of the Holy Ghost, both resides in our soul, so far as reason sees it possible that it should reside there, and is blended with our body, so that our salvation throughout every element may be perfect, that heavenly passionlessness which is peculiar to the Deity being nevertheless preserved both in the beginning and in the end of this life as Man[fn-43-P4395_2874934:12-nf] .

These things then, brethren, are declared by the Scriptures. And the blessed John, in the testimony of his Gospel, gives us an account of this economy (disposition) and acknowledges this Word as God, when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" If, then, the Word was with God, and was also God, what follows? Would one say that he speaks of two Gods?[fn-37-P3776_1202234:258-nf] I shall not indeed speak of two Gods, but of one; of two Persons however, and of a third economy (disposition), viz., the grace of the Holy Ghost. For the Father indeed is One, but there are two Persons, because there is also the Son; and then there is the third, the Holy Spirit. The Father decrees, the Word executes, and the Son is manifested, through whom the Father is believed on. The economy[fn-37-P3777_1202749:259-nf] of harmony is led back to one God; for God is One. It is the Father who commands,[fn-37-P3778_1203264:260-nf] and the Son who obeys, and the Holy Spirit who gives understanding:[fn-37-P3779_1203350:261-nf] the Father who is above all,[fn-37-P3780_1203420:262-nf] and the Son who is through all, and the Holy Spirit who is in all. And we cannot otherwise think of one God,[fn-37-P3781_1203813:263-nf] but by believing in truth in Father and Son and Holy Spirit.

The disciples recognised the Son, but not in the Holy Ghost; wherefore they also denied Him.[fn-37-P3782_1204142:264-nf] The Father's Word, therefore, knowing the economy (disposition) and the will of the Father, to wit, that the Father seeks to be worshipped in none other way than this, gave this charge to the disciples after He rose from the dead: \"Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3783_1204510:265-nf] And by this He showed, that whosoever omitted any one of these, failed in glorifying God perfectly.

However, it will be acknowledged cordially by all, that from the date of the resurrection of our Lord, those who up to that time have been humbling their souls with fastings, ought at once to begin their festal joy and gladness. But in what you have written to me you have made out very clearly, and with an intelligent understanding of the Holy Scriptures, that no very exact account seems to be offered in them of the hour at which He rose. For the evangelists have given different descriptions of the parties who came to the sepulchre one after another,[fn-15-P1582_445884:141-nf] and all have declared that they found the Lord risen already. It was \"in the end of the Sabbath,\" as Matthew has said;[fn-15-P1583_446042:142-nf] it was \"early, when it was yet dark,\" as John writes;[fn-15-P1584_446120:143-nf] it was \"very early in the morning,\" as Luke puts it; and it was \"very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun,\" as Mark tells us. Thus no one has shown us clearly the exact time when He rose. It is admitted, however, that those who came to the sepulchre in the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1585_446481:144-nf] found Him no longer lying in it. And let us not suppose that the evangelists disagree or contradict each other. But even although there may seem to be some small difficulty as to the subject of our inquiry, if they all agree that the light of the world, our Lord, rose on that one night, while they differ with respect to the hour, we may well seek with wise and faithful mind to harmonize their statements. The narrative by Matthew then, runs thus: \"In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1586_447058:145-nf] came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said.\"[fn-15-P1587_447611:146-nf] Now this phrase \"in the end\" will be thought by some to signify, according to the common use[fn-15-P1588_447730:147-nf] of the word, the evening: of the Sabbath; while others, with a better perception of the fact, will say that it does not indicate that, but a late hour in the night,[fn-15-P1589_447914:148-nf] as the phrase \"in the end\"[fn-15-P1590_447965:149-nf] denotes slowness and length of time. Also because he speaks of night, and not of evening, he has added the words, \"as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week.\" And the parties here did not come yet, as the others say, \"bearing spices,\" but \"to see the sepulchre; \"and they discovered the occurrence of the earthquake, and the angel sitting upon the stone, and heard from him the declaration, \"He is not here, He is risen.\" And to the same effect is the testimony of John. \"The first day of the week,\" says he, \"came Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1591_448627:150-nf] Only, according to this \"when it was yet dark,\" she had come in advance.[fn-15-P1592_448719:151-nf] And Luke says: \"They rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment. Now, upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1593_449025:152-nf] This phrase \"very early in the morning\"[fn-15-P1594_449100:153-nf] probably indicates the early dawn[fn-15-P1595_449157:154-nf] of the first day of the week; and thus, when the Sabbath itself was wholly past, and also the whole night succeeding it, and when another day had begun, they came, bringing spices and myrrh, and then it became apparent that He had already risen long before. And Mark follows this, and says: \"They had bought sweet spices, in order that they might come and anoint Him. And very early (in the morning), the first day of the week, they come unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\"[fn-15-P1596_449698:155-nf] For this evangelist also has used the term \"very early,\" which is just the same as the \"very early in the morning\" employed by the former; and he has added, \"at the rising of the sun.\" Thus they set out, and took their way first when it was \"very early in the morning,\" or (as Mark says) when it was \"very early; \"but on the road, and by their stay at the sepulchre, they spent the time till it was sunrise. And then the young man clad in white said to them, \"He is risen, He is not here.\" As the case stands thus, we make the following statement and explanation to those who seek an exact account of the specific hour, or half-hour, or quarter of an hour, at which it is proper to begin their rejoicing over our Lord's rising from the dead. Those who are too hasty, and give up even before midnight,[fn-15-P1597_450522:156-nf] we reprehend as remiss and intemperate, and as almost breaking off from their course in their precipitation,[fn-15-P1598_450685:157-nf] for it is a wise man's word, \"That is not little in life which is within a little.\" And those who hold out and continue for a very long time, and persevere even on to the fourth watch, which is also the time at which our Saviour manifested Himself walking upon the sea to those who were then on the deep, we receive as noble and laborious disciples. On those, again, who pause and refresh themselves in the course as they are moved or as they are able, let us not press very hard:[fn-15-P1599_451219:158-nf] for all do not carry out the six days of fasting[fn-16-P1600_451444:159-nf] either equally or alike; but some pass even all the days as a fast, remaining without food through the whole; while others take but two, and others three, and others four, and others not even one. And to those who have laboured painfully through these protracted fasts. and have thereafter become exhausted and well-nigh undone, pardon ought to be extended if they are somewhat precipitate in taking food. But if there are any who not only decline such protracted fasting, but refuse at the first to fast at all, and rather indulge themselves luxuriously during the first four days, and then when they reach the last two days-viz., the preparation and the Sabbath-fast with due rigour during these, and these alone, and think that they do something grand and brilliant if they hold out till the morning, I cannot think that they have gone through the time on equal terms with those who have been practising the same during several days before.

And the Law[fn-57-P5721_2270662:359-nf] was spoken by Angels, and perfected no one[fn-57-P5722_2271072:360-nf] , needing the visitation of the Word, as Paul hath said; but that visitation has perfected the work of the Father. And then, from Adam unto Moses death reigned[fn-57-P5723_2271252:361-nf] ; but the presence of the Word abolished death[fn-57-P5724_2271318:362-nf] . And no longer in Adam are we all dying[fn-57-P5725_2271380:363-nf] ; but in Christ we are all reviving And then, from Dan to Beersheba was the Law proclaimed, and in Judaea only was God known; but now, unto all the earth has gone forth their voice, and all the earth has been filled with the knowledge of God[fn-57-P5726_2271644:364-nf] , and the disciples have made disciples of all the nations[fn-57-P5727_2271756:365-nf] , and now is fulfilled what is written, `They shall be all taught of God[fn-57-P5728_2271854:366-nf] .' And then what was revealed was but a type; but now the truth has been manifested. And this again the Apostle himself describes afterwards more clearly, saying, `By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament;' and again, `But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also He is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.' And, `For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.' And again he says, `It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these[fn-57-P5729_2272550:367-nf] .' Both in the verse before us, then, and throughout, does he ascribe the word `better' to the Lord, who is better and other than originated things. For better is the sacrifice through Him, better the hope in Him; and also the promises through Him, not merely as great compared with small, but the one differing from the other in nature, because He who conducts this economy, is `better' than things originated.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":28,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"26.

For lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of that He hath, should wander into the irreligion of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He has said `Was given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Were delivered to Me[fn-68-P6820_2703665:276-nf] ,' only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father's Word, and the Eternal Son, who because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what He has eternally. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered,' and the like, do not impair[fn-68-P6821_2704013:277-nf] the Godhead of the Son, but rather shew Him to be truly[fn-68-P6822_2704100:278-nf] Son, we may learn from the passages themselves. For if all things are delivered unto Him, first, He is other than that all which He has received; next, being Heir of all things, He alone is the Son and proper according to the Essence of the Father. For if He were one of all, then He were not `heir of all[fn-68-P6823_2704431:279-nf] ,' but every one had received according as the Father willed and gave. But now, as receiving all things, He is other than them all, and alone proper to the Father. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered' do not shew that once He had them not, we may conclude from a similar passage, and in like manner concerning them all; for the Saviour Himself says, `As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself[fn-68-P6824_2704903:280-nf] .' Now from the words `Hath given,' He signifies that He is not the Father; but in saying `so,' He shews the Son's natural likeness and propriety towards the Father.

For lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of that He hath, should wander into the irreligion of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He has said `Was given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Were delivered to Me[fn-68-P6820_2703665:276-nf] ,' only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father's Word, and the Eternal Son, who because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what He has eternally. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered,' and the like, do not impair[fn-68-P6821_2704013:277-nf] the Godhead of the Son, but rather shew Him to be truly[fn-68-P6822_2704100:278-nf] Son, we may learn from the passages themselves. For if all things are delivered unto Him, first, He is other than that all which He has received; next, being Heir of all things, He alone is the Son and proper according to the Essence of the Father. For if He were one of all, then He were not `heir of all[fn-68-P6823_2704431:279-nf] ,' but every one had received according as the Father willed and gave. But now, as receiving all things, He is other than them all, and alone proper to the Father. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered' do not shew that once He had them not, we may conclude from a similar passage, and in like manner concerning them all; for the Saviour Himself says, `As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself[fn-68-P6824_2704903:280-nf] .'

I seek for the present, nothing stands still: what I have said is no longer present; what I am going to say is not yet come: what I have done is no longer present; what I am going to do is not yet come: the life I have lived is no longer present; the life I have still to live is not yet come. Past and future I find in every creature-movement: in truth, which is abiding, past and future I find not, but the present alone, and that unchangeably, which has no place in the creature. Sift the mutations of things, thou wilt find was and Will BE: think on God, thou wilt find the is, where was and Will BE cannot exist. To be so then thyself, rise beyond the boundaries of time. But who can transcend the powers of his being? May He raise us thither who said to the Father, \"I will that they also be with me where I am.\" And so, in making this promise, that we should not die in our sins, the Lord Jesus Christ, I think, said nothing else by these words, \"If ye believe not that I am;\" yea, by these words I think He meant nothing else than this, \"If ye believe not that I am\" God, \"ye shall die in your sins.\" Well, God be thanked that He said, \"If ye believe not,\" and did not say, If ye comprehend not. For who can comprehend this? Or is it so, since I have ventured to speakand you have seemed to understand, that you have indeed comprehended somewhat of a subject so unspeakable? If then thou comprehendest not, faith sets thee free. Therefore also the Lord said not, If ye comprehend not that I am; but said what they were capable of attaining, \"If ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.\"","title":"Tractate XXXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_75_sermon_lviii_cviii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

Behold another lofty degree of your glory; behold, with confession, a double title to deserving well of God,-to stand with a firm step, and to drive away in this struggle, by the strength of your faith, those who endeavour to make a breach in the Gospel, and bring impious hands to the work of undermining the Lord's precepts:-to have before afforded the indications of courage, and now to afford lessons of life. The Lord, when, after His resurrection, He sent forth His apostles, charges them, saying, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\"[fn-51-P5141_1561082:2-nf] And the Apostle John, remembering this charge, subsequently lays it down in his epistle: \"Hereby,\" says he, \"we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He that saith he knoweth Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\"[fn-51-P5142_1561378:3-nf] You prompt the keeping of these precepts; you observe the divine and heavenly commands.

I rejoice, therefore, on your behalf, most brave and faithful brethren; and as much as I congratulate the martyrs there honoured for the glory of their strength, so much do I also equally congratulate you for the crown of the Lord's discipline. The Lord has shed forth His condescension in manifold kinds of liberality. He has distributed the praises of good soldiers and their spiritual glories in plentiful variety. We also are sharers in your honour; we count your glory our glory, whose times have been brightened by such a felicity, that it should be the fortune of our day to see the proved servants of God and Christ's soldiers crowned.

To neglect these things any further, and to persevere in the former error, what is it else than to fall under the Lord's rebuke, who in the l psalm reproveth, and says, \"What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction and castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.\"[fn-60-P6011_1895305:41-nf] For to declare the righteousness and the covenant of the Lord, and not to do the same that the Lord did, what else is it than to cast away His words and to despise the Lord's instruction, to commit not earthly, but spiritual thefts and adulteries? While any one is stealing from evangelical truth the words and doings of our Lord, he is corrupting and adulterating the divine precepts, as it is written in Jeremiah. He says, \"What is the chaff to the wheat? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, who steal my words every one froth his neighbour, and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness.\"[fn-60-P6012_1895959:42-nf] Also in the same prophet, in another place, He says, \"She committed adultery with stocks and stones, and yet for all this she turned not unto me.\"[fn-60-P6013_1896135:43-nf] That this theft and adultery may not fall unto us also, we ought to be anxiously careful, and fearfully and religiously to watch. For if we are priests of God and of Christ, I do not know any one whom we ought rather to follow than God and Christ, since He Himself emphatically says in the Gospel, \"I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"[fn-60-P6014_1896568:44-nf] Lest therefore we should walk in darkness, we ought to follow Christ, and to observe his precepts, because He Himself told His apostles in another place, as He sent them forth, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and earth. Go, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\"[fn-60-P6015_1897003:45-nf] Wherefore, if we wish to walk in the light of Christ, let us not depart from His precepts and monitions, giving thanks that, while He instructs for the future what we ought to do, He pardons for the past wherein we in our simplicity have erred. And because already His second coming draws near to us, His benign and liberal condescension is more and more illuminating our hearts with the light of truth.[fn-60-P6016_1897433:46-nf] ","title":"Epistle LXII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":28,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_21_letter_xvi_to_the_bishops_of_sicily_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Although, therefore, both these things which are connected with Christ's humiliation and those which are connected with His exaltation meet in one and the same Person, and all that is in Him of Divine power and human weakness conduces to the accomplishment of our restoration: yet it is appropriate that the power of baptism should change the old into the new creature on the death-day of the Crucified and the Resurrection-day of the Dead: that Christ's death and His resurrection may operate in the re-born[fn-8-P865_192999:9-nf] , as the blessed Apostle says: \"Are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized in Christ Jesus, were baptized in His death? We were buried with Him through baptism into death; that as Christ rose from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have become united with the likeness of His death, we shall be also (with the likeness) of His resurrections[fn-8-P866_193460:10-nf] ,\" and the rest which the Teacher of the Gentiles discusses further in recommending the sacrament of baptism: that it might be seen from the spirit of this doctrine that that is the day, and that the time chosen for regenerating the sons of men and adopting them among the sons of God, on which by a mystical symbolism and form[fn-8-P867_193954:11-nf] , what is done in the limbs coincides with what wasdone in the Head Himself, for in the baptismal office death ensues through the slaying of sin, and threefold immersion imitates the lying in the tomb three days, and the raising out of the water is like Him that rose again from the tomb[fn-8-P868_194285:12-nf] . The very nature, therefore of the act teaches us that that is the recognized day for the general reception of the grace[fn-8-P869_194535:13-nf] , on which the power of the gift and the character of the action originated. And this is strongly corroborated by the consideration that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, after He rose from the dead, handed on both the form and power of baptizing to His disciples, in whose person all the chiefs of the churches received their instructions with these words, \"Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghosts[fn-8-P870_195205:14-nf] .\" On which of course He might have instructed them even before His passion, had He not especially wished it to be understood that the grace of regeneration began with His resurrection. It must be added, indeed, that the solemn season of Pentecost, hallowed by the coming of the Holy Ghost is also allowed, being as it were, the sequel and completion of the Paschal feast. And while other festivals are held on other days of the week, this festival (of Pentecost) always occurs on that day, which is marked by the Lord's resurrection: holding out, so to say, the hand of assisting grace and inviting those, who have been cut off from the Easter feast by disabling sickness or length of journey or difficulties of sailing, to gain the purpose that they long for through the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the Only-begotten of God Himself wished no difference to be felt between Himself and the Holy Spirit in the Faith of believers and in the efficacy of His works: because there is no diversity in their nature, as He says, \"I will ask the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth[fn-8-P871_196375:15-nf] ;\" and again: \"But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you[fn-8-P872_196578:16-nf] ;\" and again: \"When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He shall guide you into all the Truth[fn-8-P873_196685:17-nf] .\" And thus, since Christ is the Truth, and the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Truth, and the name of \"Comforter\" appropriate to both, the two festivals are not dissimilar, where the sacrament is the same[fn-8-P874_196905:18-nf] .
