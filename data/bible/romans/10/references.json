So that he mentioned the inner man as coming into the world, because the outward man is of a corporeal nature, just as this world itself; as if he said, \"Which lighteth every man that cometh into the body,\" in accordance with that which is written: \"I obtained a good spirit, and I came in a body undefiled.\"[fn-5-P508_390252:120-nf] Or again, the passage, \"Which lighteth every one that cometh into the world,\"-if it was added for the sake of expressing some distinction,-might perhaps mean: Which lighteth every inner man, because the inner man, when he becomes truly wise, is enlightened only by Him who is the true Light. Or, once more, if the intention was to designate reason herself, which causes the human soul to be called rational (and this reason, although as yet quiet and as it were asleep, for all that lies hidden in infants, innate and, so to speak, implanted), by the term illumination, as if it were the creation of an inner eye, then it cannot be denied that it is made when the soul is created; and there is no absurdity in supposing this to take place when the human being comes into the world.

But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no sin.\"[fn-5-P547_401502:144-nf] And then after no long interval he observes: \"Now, it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on Him that raised up Jesus Christ our Lord from the dealt;who was delivered for our offences, and wasraised again for our justification.\"[fn-5-P548_401840:145-nf] Then a littleafter he writes: \"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.\"[fn-5-P549_401975:146-nf] in another passage he says: \"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.

For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing; for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.

Wherefore also the prophet David says, \"Thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\"[fn-8-P862_140100:174-nf] And this the great Paul, the herald of the truth, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, states to have been spoken of the Son.[fn-8-P863_140270:175-nf] And in another place God says through the Prophet, \"I am the Lord: I change not.\"[fn-8-P864_140515:176-nf] If then the Divine is immutable and invariable, it is incapable of change or alteration. And if the immutable cannot be changed, then God the Word was not made flesh by mutation, but took flesh and tabernacled in us, according to the word of the evangelist. This the divine Paul expresses clearly in his Epistle to the Philippians in the words, \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-8-P865_141138:177-nf] Now it is plain from these words that the form of God was not changed into the form of a servant, but, remaining what it was, took the form of the servant. So God the Word was not made flesh, but assumed living and reasonable flesh. He Himself is not naturally conceived of the Virgin, fashioned, formed, and deriving beginning of existence from her; He who is before the ages, God, and with God, being with the Father and with the Father both known and worshipped; but He fashioned for Himself a temple in the Virgin's womb, and was with that which was formed and begotten. Wherefore also we style that holy Virgin qeotokoj, not because she gave birth in natural manner to God, but to man united to the God that had fashioned Him. Moreover if He that was fashioned in the Virgin's womb was not man but God the Word Who is before the ages, then God the Word is a creature of the Holy Ghost. For that which was conceived in her, says Gabriel, is of the Holy Ghost.[fn-8-P866_142121:178-nf] But if the only begotten Word of God is uncreate and of one substance and co-eternal with the Father it is no longer a formation or creation of the Spirit. And if the Holy Ghost did not fashion God the Word in the Virgin's womb, it follows that we understand the form of the servant to have been fashioned, formed, conceived, and generated. But since the form was not stripped of the form of God, but was a Temple containing God the Word dwelling in it, according to the words of Paul \"For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell\" \"bodily,\"[fn-8-P867_142703:179-nf] we call the Virgin not mother of man (anqrwpotokoj) but mother of God (qeotokoj), applying the former title to the fashioning and conception, but the latter to the union. For this cause the child who was born is called Emmanuel, neither God separated from human nature nor man stripped of Godhead. For Emmanuel is interpreted to mean \"God with us\", according to the words of the Gospels; and the expression \"God with us\" at once manifests Him Who for our sakes was assumed out of us, and proclaims God the Word Who assumed. Therefore the child is called Emmanuel on account of God Who assumed, and the Virgin qeotokoj on account of the union of the form of God with the conceived form of a servant. For God the Word was not changed into flesh, but the form of God took the form of a servant.","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":10,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Here, perhaps, it may be said by that presumption of man, which is ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishes to establish one of its own, that the apostle quite properly said,\" For by the law shall no man be justified,\"[fn-13-P1350_671598:46-nf] inasmuch as the law merely shows what one ought to do, and what one ought to guard against, in order that what the law thus points out may be accomplished by the will, and so man be justified, not indeed by the power of the law, but by his free determination. But I ask your attention, O man, to what follows. \"But now the righteousness of God,\" says he, \"without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.\"[fn-13-P1351_672050:47-nf] Does this then sound a light thing in deaf ears? He says, \"The righteousness of God is manifested.\" Now this righteousness they are ignorant of, who wish to establish one of their own; they will not submit themselves to it.[fn-13-P1352_672293:48-nf] His words are, \"The righteousness of God is manifested:\" he does not say, the righteousness of man, or the righteousness of his own will, but the \"righteousness of God,\"-not that whereby He is Himself righteous, but that with which He endows man when He justifies the ungodly. This is witnessed by the law and the prophets; in other words, the law and the prophets each afford it testimony. The law, indeed, by issuing its commands and threats, and by justifying no man, sufficiently shows that it is by God's gift, through the help of the Spirit, that a man is justified; and the prophets, because it was what they predicted that Christ at His coming accomplished. Accordingly he advances a step further, and adds, \"But righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-13-P1353_673079:49-nf] that is by the faith wherewith one believes in Christ for just as there is not meant the faith with which Christ Himself believes, so also there is not meant the righteousness whereby God is Himself righteous. Both no doubt are ours, but yet they are called God's, and Christ's, because it is by their bounty that these gifts are bestowed upon us. The righteousness of God then is without the law, but not manifested without the law; for if it were manifested without the law, how could it be witnessed by the law? That righteousness of God, however, is without the law, which God by the Spirit of grace bestows on the believer without the help of the law,-that is, when not helped by the law. When, indeed, He by the law discovers to a man his weakness, it is in order that by faith he may flee for refuge to His mercy, and be healed. And thus concerning His wisdom we are told, that \"she carries law and mercy uponher tongue,\"[fn-13-P1354_674027:50-nf] - the \"law,\" whereby she may convict the proud, the \"mercy,\" wherewith she may justify the humbled. \"The righteousness of God,\" then, \"by faith of Jesus Christ, is unto all that believe; for there is no difference, for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\"[fn-13-P1355_674319:51-nf] -not of their own glory. For what have they, which they have not received? Now if they received it, why do they glory as if they had not received it?[fn-13-P1356_674492:52-nf] Well, then, they come short of the glory of God; now observe what follows: \"Being justified freely by His grace.\"[fn-13-P1357_674625:53-nf] It is not, therefore, by the law, nor is it by their own will, that they are justified; but they are justified freely by His grace, - not that it is wrought without our will; but our will is by the law shown to be weak, that grace may heal its infirmity; and that our healed will may fulfil the law, not by compact under the law, nor yet in the absence of law.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now why need I speak of what follows?

For in this letter of mine we have not undertaken to expound this epistle, but only mainly on its authority, to demonstrate, so far as we are able, that we are assisted by divine aid towards the achievement of righteousness,-not merely because God has given us a law fall of good and holy precepts, but because our very will without which we cannot do any good thing, is assisted and elevated by the importation of the Spirit of grace, without which help mere teaching is \"the letter that killeth,\"[fn-14-P1400_687122:81-nf] forasmuch as it rather holds them guilty of transgression, than justifies the ungodly.

What the law of works enjoins by menace, that the law of faith secures by faith. The one says, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-14-P1416_692191:91-nf] the other says, \"When I perceived that nobody could be continent, except God gave it to him; and that this was the very point of wisdom, to know whose gift she was; I approached unto the Lord, and I besought Him.\"[fn-14-P1417_692422:92-nf] This indeed is the very wisdom which is called piety, in which is worshipped \"the Father of lights, from whom is every best giving and perfect gift.\"[fn-14-P1418_692594:93-nf] This worship, however, consists in the sacrifice of praise and giving of thanks, so that the worshipper of God boasts not in himself, but in Him.[fn-14-P1419_692757:94-nf] Accordingly, by the law of works, God says to us, Do what I command thee; but by the law of faith we say to God, Give me what Thou commandest. Now this is the reason why the law gives its command, - to admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that he to whom the command is given, if he is as yet unable to perform it, may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability, and complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the ability comes. \"For we have received not the spirit of this world,\" says again that most constant preacher of grace, \"but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-14-P1420_693454:95-nf] What, however, \"is the spirit of this world,\" but the spirit of pride? By it their foolish heart is darkened, who, although knowing God, glorified Him not as God, by giving Him thanks.[fn-14-P1421_693660:96-nf] Moreover, it is really by this same spirit that they too are deceived, who, while ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to God's righteousness.[fn-14-P1422_693890:97-nf] It appears to me, therefore, that he is much more \"a child of faith\" who has learned from what source to hope for what he has not yet, than he who attributes to himself whatever he has; although, no doubt, to both of these must be preferred the man who both has, and at the same time knows from whom he has it, if nevertheless he does not believe himself to be what he has not yet attained to. Let him not fall into the mistake of the Pharisee, who, while thanking God for what he possessed, yet failed to ask for any further gift, just as if he stood in, want of nothing for the increase or perfection of his righteousness.[fn-14-P1423_694531:98-nf] Now, having duly considered and weighed all these circumstances and testimonies, we conclude that a man is not justified by the precepts of a holy life, but by faith in Jesus Christ,-in a word, not by the law of works, but by the law of faith; not by the letter,but by the spirit; not by the merits of deeds, but by free grace.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"149","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Accordingly, in our prophet likewise, whose testimony we are dealing with, this is added, that in God is the reward, in Him the end, in Him the perfection of happiness, in Him the sum of the blessed and eternal life.

For by this faith we believe that God will raise even us from the dead,-even now in the spirit, that we may in this present world live soberly, righteously, and godly in the renewal of His grace; and by and by in our flesh, which shall rise again to immortality, which indeed is the reward of the Spirit, who precedes it by a resurrection which is appropriate to Himself,-that is, by justification. \"For we are buried with Christ by baptism unto death, thatlike as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walkin newness of life.\"[fn-16-P1692_762466:280-nf] By faith, therefore, in Jesus Christ we obtain salvation,-both in so far as it is begun within us in reality, and in so far as its perfection is waited for in hope; \"for whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\"[fn-16-P1693_762717:281-nf] \"How abundant,\" says the Psalmist, \"is the multitude of Thy goodness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, and hast perfected for them that hope in Thee!\"[fn-16-P1694_762924:282-nf] By the law we fear God; by faith we hope in God: but from those who fear punishment grace is hidden. And the soul which labours under this fear, since it has not conquered its evil concupiscence, and from which this fear, like a harsh master, has not departed,-let it flee by faith for refuge to the mercy of God, that He may give it what He commands, and may, by inspiring into it the sweetness of His gracethrough His Holy Spirit, cause the soul to delight more in what He teaches it, than it delights in what opposes His instruction. In this manner it is that the great abundance of His sweetness,- that is, the law of faith,-His love which is in our hearts, and shed abroad, is perfected in them that hope in Him, that good may be wrought by the soul, healed not by the fear of punishment, but by the love of righteousness.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":61,"source_paragraph":"189","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This is the order observed in the psalm, where it is said: \"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His recompenses; who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercy; who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1776_785002:340-nf] And lest by any chance these great blessings should be despaired of under the deformity of our old, that is, mortal condition, the Psalmist at once says, \"Thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's;\"[fn-17-P1777_785225:341-nf] as much as to say, All that you have heard belongs to the new man and to the new covenant. Now let us consider together briefly these things, and with delight contemplate the praise of mercy, that is, of the grace of God. \"Bless the Lord, O my soul,\" he says, \"and forget not all His recompenses.\" Observe, he does not say blessings, but recompenses;[fn-17-P1778_785596:342-nf] because He recompenses evil with good. \"Who forgiveth all thine iniquities:\" this is done in the sacrament of baptism. \"Who healeth all thy diseases:\" this is effected by the believer in the present life, while the flesh so lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, that we do not the things we would;[fn-17-P1779_785960:343-nf] whilst also another law in our members wars against the law of our mind;[fn-17-P1780_786052:344-nf] whilst to will is present indeed to us but not how to perform that which is good.[fn-17-P1781_786154:345-nf] These are the diseases of a man's old nature which, however, if we only advance with persevering purpose, are healed by the growth of the new nature day by day, by the faith which operates through love.[fn-17-P1782_786377:346-nf] \"Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;\" this will take place at the resurrection of the dead in the last day. \"Who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercy;\" this shall be accomplished in the day of judgment; for when the righteous King shall sit upon His throne to render to every man according to his works, who shall then boast of having a pure heart? or who shall glory of being clean from sin? It was therefore necessary to mention God's loving-kindness and tender mercy there, where one might expect debts to be demanded and deserts recompensed so strictly as to leave no room for mercy. He crowns, therefore, with loving-kindness and tender mercy; but even so according to works. For he shall be separated to the right hand, to whom, it is said, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat.\"[fn-17-P1783_787204:347-nf] There will, however, be also \"judgment without mercy;\" but it will be for him\" that hath not showed mercy.\"[fn-17-P1784_787334:348-nf] But \"blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\"[fn-17-P1785_787414:349-nf] of God. Then, as soon as those on the left hand shall have gone into eternal fire, the righteous, too, shall go into everlasting life,[fn-17-P1786_787568:350-nf] because He says: \"This is life eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-17-P1787_787712:351-nf] And with this knowledge, this vision, this contemplation, shall the desire of their soul be satisfied; for it shall be enough for it to have this and nothing else,-there being nothing more for it to desire, to aspire to, or to require. It was with a craving after this full joy that his heart glowed who said to the Lord Christ, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;\" and to whom the answer was returned,\" He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-17-P1788_788187:352-nf] Because He is Himself the eternal life, in order that men may know the one true God, Thee and whom Thou hast sent, Jesus Christ. If, however, he that has seen the Son has also seen the Father, then assuredly he who sees the Father and the Son sees also the Holy Spirit of the Father and the Son.

In short, when the sacerdotal law was being drawn up, through Moses, in Leviticus, we find it prescribed to the people of Israel that sacrifices should in no other place be offered to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give to \"the people\" Israel and to their brethren, in order that, on Israel's introduction thither, there should there be celebrated sacrifices and holocausts, as well for sins as for souls; and nowhere else but in the holy land.[fn-21-P2117_720711:74-nf] Why, accordingly, does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the prophets, that it should come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be offered sacrifices to God? as He says through the angel Malachi, one of the twelve prophets: \"I will not receive sacrifice from your hands; for from the rising sun unto the setting my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord Almighty: and in every place they offer clean sacrifices to my Name.\"[fn-21-P2118_721230:75-nf] Again, in the Pslams, David says: \"Bring to God, ye countries of the nations\"-undoubtedly because \"unto every land\" the preaching of the apostles had to \"go out\"[fn-21-P2119_721425:76-nf] -\"bring to God fame and honour; bring to God the sacrifices of His name: take up[fn-21-P2120_721639:77-nf] victims and enter into His courts.\"[fn-21-P2121_721724:78-nf] For that it is not by earthly sacrifices, but by spiritual, that offering is to be made to God, we thus read, as it is written, An heart contribulate and humbled is a victim for God; \"[fn-21-P2122_721987:79-nf] and elsewhere, \"Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and render to the Highest thy vows.\"[fn-21-P2123_722117:80-nf] Thus, accordingly, the spiritual \"sacrifices of praise\" are pointed to, and \"an heart contribulate\" is demonstrated an acceptable sacrifice to God. And thus, as carnal sacrifices are understood to be reprobated-of which Isaiah withal speaks, saying, \"To what end is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the Lord\"[fn-21-P2124_722471:81-nf] -so spiritual sacrifices are predicted[fn-21-P2125_722527:82-nf] as accepted, as the prophets announce. For, \"even if ye shall have brought me,\" He says, \"the finest wheat flour, it is a vain supplicatory gift: a thing execrable to me; \"and again He says, \"Your holocausts and sacrifices, and the fat of goats, and blood of bulls, I will not, not even if ye come to be seen by me: for who hath required these things from your hands? \"[fn-21-P2126_722918:83-nf] for \"from the rising sun unto the setting, my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2127_723081:84-nf] But of the spiritual sacrifices He adds, saying, \"And in every place they offer dean sacrifices to my Name, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2128_723233:85-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Therefore upon this issue plant we foot to foot, whether the Christ who was constantly announced as to come be already come, or whether His coming be yet a subject of hope. For proof of which question itself, the times likewise must be examined by us when the prophets announced that the Christ would come; that, if we succeed in recognising that He has come within the limits of those times, we may without doubt believe Him to be the very one whose future coming was ever the theme of prophetic song, upon whom we-the nations, to wit-were ever announced as destined to believe; and that, when it shall have been agreed that He is come, we may undoubtedly likewise believe that the new law has by Him been given, and not disavow the new testament in Him and through Him drawn up for us. For that Christ was to come we know that even the Jews do not attempt to disprove, inasmuch as it is to His advent that they are directing their hope. Nor need we inquire at more length concerning that matter, since in days bygone all the prophets have prophesied of it; as Isaiah: \"Thus saith the Lord God to my Christ (the) Lord,[fn-21-P2143_727145:93-nf] whose right hand I have holden, that the nations may hear Him: the powers of kings will I burst asunder; I will open before Him the gates, and the cities shall not be closed to Him.\" Which very thing we see fulfilled. For whose right hand does God the Father hold but Christ's, His Son?-whom all nations have heard, that is, whom all nations have believed,-whose preachers, withal, the apostles, are pointed to in the Psalms of David: \"Into the universal earth,\" says he, \"is gone out their sound, and unto the ends of the earth their words.\"[fn-21-P2144_727961:94-nf] For upon whom else have the universal nations believed, but upon the Christ who is already come? For whom have the nations believed,-Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and they who inhabit Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, and they who dwell in Pontus, and Asia, and Pamphylia, tarriers in Egypt, and inhabiters of the region of Africa which is beyond Cyrene, Romans and sojourners, yes, and in Jerusalem Jews,[fn-21-P2145_728427:95-nf] and all other nations; as, for instance, by this time, the varied races of the Gµtulians, and manifold confines of the Moors, all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons-inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ, and of the Sarmatians, and Dacians, and Germans, and Scythians, and of many remote nations, and of provinces and islands many, to us unknown, and which we can scarce enumerate? In all which places the name of the Christ who is already come reigns, as of Him before whom the gates of all cities have been opened, and to whom none are closed, before whom iron bars have been crumbled, and brazen gates[fn-21-P2146_729148:96-nf] opened. Although there be withal a spiritual sense to be affixed to these expressions,-that the hearts of individuals, blockaded in various ways by the devil, are unbarred by the faith of Christ,-still they have been evidently fulfilled, inasmuch as in all these places dwells the \"people\" of the Name of Christ. For who could have reigned over all nations but Christ, God's Son, who was ever announced as destined to reign over all to eternity? For if Solomon \"reigned,\" why, it was within the confines of Judea merely: \"from Beersheba unto Dan\" the boundaries of his kingdom are marked.[fn-21-P2147_729806:97-nf] If, moreover, Darius \"reigned\" over the Babylonians and Parthians, he had not power over all nations; if Pharaoh, or whoever succeeded him in his hereditary kingdom, over the Egyptians, in that country merely did he possess his kingdom's dominion; if Nebuchadnezzar with his petty kings, \"from India unto Ethiopia\" he had his kingdom's boundaries;[fn-21-P2148_730567:98-nf] if Alexander the Macedonian he did not hold more than universal Asia, and other regions, after he had quite conquered them; if the Germans, to this day they are not suffered to cross their own limits; the Britons are shut within the circuit of their own ocean; the nations of the Moors, and the barbarism of the Gµtulians, are blockaded by the Romans, lest they exceed the confines of their own regions. What shall I say of the Romans themselves,[fn-21-P2149_731044:99-nf] who fortify their own empire with garrisons of their own legions, nor can extend the might of their kingdom beyond these nations? But Christ's Name is extending everywhere, believed everywhere, worshipped by all the above-enumerated nations, reigning everywhere, adored everywhere, conferred equally everywhere upon all. No king, with Him, finds greater favour, no barbarian lesser joy; no dignities or pedigrees enjoy distinctions of merit; to all He is equal, to all King, to all Judge, to all \"God and Lord.\"[fn-21-P2150_731696:100-nf] Nor would you hesitate to believe what we asseverate, since you see it taking place.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"127","folder":"ANF-03","text":"A second time, in fact, let us show that Christ is already come, (as foretold) through the prophets, and has suffered, and is already received back in the heavens, and thence is to come accordingly as the predictions prophesied.

I do not deny, that all of us who believe in Christ have passed from the error of idolatry. For we are not born Christians, but become Christians by being born again. And because we formerly worshipped idols, does it follow that we ought not now to worship God lest we seem to pay like honour to Him and to idols? In the one case respect was paid to idols, and therefore the ceremony is to be abhorred; in the other the martyrs are venerated, and the same ceremony is therefore to be allowed. Throughout the whole Eastern Church, even when there are no relics of the martyrs, whenever the Gospel is to be read the candles are lighted, although the dawn may be reddening the sky, not of course to scatter the darkness, but by way of evidencing our joy.[fn-69-P6966_2239365:27-nf] And accordingly the virgins in the Gospel always have their lamps lighted.

Indeed, those men who say that there is no such directing faculty, have begun by supposing that the soul itself is simply a nonentity. One Dicµarchus, a Messenian, and amongst the medical profession Andreas and Asclepiades, have thus destroyed the (soul's) directing power, by actually placing in the mind the senses, for which they claim the ruling faculty. Asclepiades rides rough-shod over us with even this argument, that very many animals, after losing those parts of their body in which the soul's principle of vitality and sensation is thought mainly to exist, still retain life in a considerable degree, as well as sensation: as in the case of flies, and wasps, and locusts, when you have cut off their heads; and of she-goats, and tortoises, and eels, when you have pulled out their hearts. (He concludes), therefore, that there is no especial principle or power of the soul; for if there were, the soul's vigour and strength could not continue when it was removed with its domiciles (or corporeal organs). However, Dicµarchus has several authorities against him-and philosophers too-Plato, Strato, Epicurus, Democritus, Empedocles, Socrates, Aristotle; whilst in opposition to Andreas and Asclepiades (may be placed their brother) physicians Herophilus, Erasistratus, Diocles, Hippocrates, and Soranus himself; and better than all others, there are our Christian authorities. We are taught by God concerning both these questions-viz. that there is a ruling power in the soul, and that it is enshrined[fn-27-P2706_907462:96-nf] in one particular recess of the body.

Tell me what else is there of all things in creation the admits of comparison with a different thing, seeing that the characteristic nature that appears in each absolutely rejects community with things of a different kind[fn-15-P1529_873290:56-nf] ? The heaven admits no comparison with the earth, nor this with the stars, nor the stars with the seas, nor water with stone, nor animals with trees, nor land animals with winged creatures, nor four-footed beasts with those that swim, nor irrational with rational creatures. Indeed, why should one take up time with individual instances, in showing that we may say of every single thing that we behold in the creation, precisely what was thrown to the Only-begotten, as if it were something special-that He admits of comparison with none of the things that have been produced after Him and by Him? For it is clear that everything which you conceive by itself is incapable of comparison with the universe, and with the individual things which compose it; and it is this, which may be truly said of any creature you please, which is allotted by the enemies of the truth, as adequate and sufficient for His honour and glory, to the Only-begotten God! And once more, putting together phrases of the same sort in the remainder of the passage, he dignifies Him with his empty honours, calling Him \"Lord\" and \"Only-begotten\": but that no orthodox meaning may be conveyed to his readers by these names, he promptly mixes up blasphemy with the more notable of them. His phrase runs thus:-\"Inasmuch,\" he says, \"as the generated essence leaves no room for community to anything else (for it is only-begotten[fn-15-P1530_874771:57-nf] ), nor is the operation of the Maker contemplated as common.\" O marvellous insolence! as though he were addressing his harangue to brutes, or senseless beings \"which have no understanding[fn-15-P1531_875096:58-nf] ,\" he twists his argument about in contrary ways, as he pleases; or rather he suffers as men do who are deprived of sight; for they too behave often in unseemly ways before the eyes of those who see, supposing, because they themselves cannot see, that they are also unseen. For what sort of man is it who does not see the contradiction in his words? Because it is \"generated,\" he says, the essence leaves other things no room for community, for it is only-begotten; and then when he has uttered these words, really as though he did not see or did not suppose himself to be seen, he tacks on, as if corresponding to what he has said, things that have nothing in common with them, coupling \"the operation of the maker\" with the essence of the Only-begotten. That which is generated is correlative to the generator, and the Only-begotten, surely, by consequence, to the Father; and he who looks to the truth beholds, in co-ordination with the Son, not \"the operation of the maker,\" but the nature of Him that begat Him. But he, as if he were talking about plants or seeds, or some other thing in the order of creation, sets \"the operation of the maker\" by the side of the existence[fn-15-P1532_876294:59-nf] of the Only-begotten. Why, if a stone or a stick, or something of that sort, were the subject of consideration, it would be logical to pre-suppose \"the operation of the maker\"; but if the Only-begotten God is confessed, even by His adversaries, to be a Son, and to exist by way of generation, how do the same words befit Him that befit the lowest portions of the creation? how do they think it pious to say concerning the Lord the very thing which may be truly said of an ant or a gnat? For if any one understood the nature of an ant, and its peculiar ties in reference to other living things, he would not be beyond the truth in saying that \"the operation of its maker is not contemplated as common\" with reference to the other things. What, therefore, is affirmed of such things as these, this they predicate also of the Only-begotten, and as hunters are said to intercept the passage of their game with holes, and to conceal their design by covering over the mouths of the holes with some unsound and unsubstantial material, in order that the pit may seem level with the ground about it, so heresy contrives against men something of the same sort, covering over the hole of their impiety with these fine-sounding and pious names, as it were with a level thatch, so that those who are rather unintelligent, thinking that these men's preaching is the same with the true faith, because of the agreement of their words, hasten towards the mere name of the Son and the Only-begotten, and step into emptiness in the hole, since the significance of these titles will not sustain the weight of their tread, but lets them down into the pitfall of the denial of Christ. This is why he speaks of the generated essence that leaves nothing room for community, and calls it \"Only-begotten.\" These are the coverings of the hole. But when any one stops before he is caught in the gulf, and puts forth the test of argument, like a hand, upon his discourse, he sees the dangerous downfall of idolatry lying beneath the doctrine. For when he draws near, as though to God and the Son of God, he finds a creature of God set forth for his worship. This is why they proclaim high and low the name of the Only-begotten, that the destruction may be readily accepted by the victims of their deceit, as though one were to mix up poison in bread, and give a deadly greeting to those who asked for food, who would not have been willing to take the poison by itself, had they not been enticed to what they saw. Thus he has a sharp eye to the object of his efforts, at least so far as his own opinion goes. For if he had entirely rejected from his teaching the name of the Son, his falsehood would not have been acceptable to men, when his denial was openly stated in a definite proclamation; but now leaving only the name, and changing the signification of it to express creation, he at once sets up his idolatry, and fraudulently hides its reproach. But since we are bidden not to honour God with our lips[fn-15-P1533_879289:60-nf] , and piety is not tested by the sound of a word, but the Son must first be the object of belief in the heart unto righteousness, and then be confessed with the mouth unto salvation[fn-15-P1534_879494:61-nf] , and those who say in their hearts that He is not God, even though with their mouths they confess Him as Lord, are corrupt and became abominable[fn-15-P1535_879661:62-nf] , as the prophet says,-for this cause, I say, we must look to the mind of those who put forward, forsooth, the words of the faith, and not be enticed to follow their sound. If, then, one who speaks of the Son does not by that word refer to a creature, he is on our side and not on the enemy's; but if any one applies the name of Son to the creation, he is to be ranked among idolaters. For they too gave the name of God to Dagon and Bel and the Dragon, but they did not on that account worship God. For the wood and the brass and the monster were not God.

Accordingly, the word that sounds outwardly is the sign of the word that gives light inwardly; which latter has the greater claim to be called a word. For that which is uttered with the mouth of the flesh, is the articulate sound of a word; and is itself also called a word, on account of that to make which outwardly apparent it is itself assumed. For our word is so made in some way into an articulate sound of the body, by assuming that articulate sound by which it may be manifested to men's senses, as the Word of God was made flesh, by assuming that flesh in which itself also might be manifested to men's senses. And as our word becomes an articulate sound, yet is not changed into one; so the Word of God became flesh, but far be it from us to say He was changed into flesh, For both that word of ours became an articulate sound, and that other Word became flesh, by assuming it, not by consuming itself so as to be changed into it. And therefore whoever desires to arrive at any likeness, be it of what sort it may, of the Word of God, however in many respects unlike, must not regard the word of ours that, sounds in the ears, either when it is uttered in an articulate sound or when it is silently thought. For the words of all tongues that are uttered in sound are also silently thought, and the mind runs over verses while the bodily mouth is silent. And not only the numbers of syllables, but the tunes also of songs, since they are corporeal, and pertain to that sense of the body which is called hearing, are at hand by certain incorporeal images appropriate to them, to those who think of them, and who silently revolve all these things. But we must pass by this, in order to arrive at that word of man, by the likeness of which, be it of what sort it may, the Word of God may be somehow seen as in an enigma. Not that word which was spoken to this or that prophet, and of which it is said, \"Now the word of God grew and multiplied;\"[fn-19-P1983_1000529:43-nf] and again, \"Faith then cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ;\"[fn-19-P1984_1000625:44-nf] and again, \"When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men but, as it is in truth, the word of God\"[fn-19-P1985_1000788:45-nf] (and there are countless other like sayings in the Scriptures respecting the word of God, which is disseminated in the sounds of many and diverse languages through the hearts and mouths of men; and which is therefore called the word of God, because the doctrine thai is delivered is not human, but divine);-but we are now seeking to see, in whatsoever way we can, by means of this likeness, that Word of God of which it is said, \"The Word was God;\" of which it is said, \"All things were made by Him;\" of which it is said, \"The Word became flesh;\" of which it is said \"The Word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom.\"[fn-19-P1986_1001430:46-nf] We must go on, then, to that word of man, to the word of the rational animal, to the word of that image of God, that is not born of God, but made by God; which is neither utterable in sound nor capable of being thought under the likeness of sound such as must needs be with the word of any tongue; but which precedes all the signs by which it is signified, and is begotten from the knowledge that continues in the mind, when that same knowledge is spoken inwardly according as it really is. For the sight of thinking is exceedingly like the sight of knowledge. For when it is uttered by sound, or by any bodily sign, it is not uttered according as it really is, but as it can be seen or heard by the body. When, therefore, that is in the word which is in the knowledge, then there is a true word, and truth, such as is looked for from man; such that what is in the knowledge is also in the word, and what is not in the knowledge is also not in the word. Here may be recognized, \"Yea, yea; nay, nay.\"[fn-19-P1987_1002449:47-nf] And so this likeness of the image that is made, approaches as nearly as is possible to that likeness of the image that is born, by which God the Son is declared to be in all things like in substance to the Father. We must notice in this enigma also another likeness of the word of God; viz. that, as it is said of that Word, \"All things were made by Him,\" where God is declared to have made the universe by His only-begotten Son, so there are no works of man that are not first spoken in his heart: whence it is written, \"A word is the beginning of every work.\"[fn-19-P1988_1003029:48-nf] But here also, it is when the word is true, that then it is the beginning of a good work. And a word is true when it is begotten from the knowledge of working good works, so that there too may be preserved the \"yea yea, nay nay;\" in order that whatever is in that knowledge by which we are to live, may be also in the word by which we are to work, and whatever is not in the one may not be in the other. Otherwise such a word will be a lie, not truth; and what comes thence will be a sin, and not a good work. There is yet this other likeness of the Word of God in this likeness of our word, that there can be a word of ours with no work following it, but there cannot be any work unless a word precedes; just as the Word of God could have existed though no creature existed, but no creature could exist unless by that Word by which all things are made. And therefore not God the Father, not the Holy Spirit, not the Trinity itself, but the Son only, which is the Word of God, was made flesh; although the Trinity was the maker: in order that we might live rightly through our word following and imitating His example, i.e. by having no lie in either the thought or the work of our word. But this perfection of this image is one to be at some time hereafter. In order to attain this it is that the good master teaches us by Christian faith, and by pious doctrine, that \"with face unveiled\" from the veil of the law, which is the shadow of things to come, \"beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,\" i.e. gazing at it through a glass, \"we may be transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord;\"[fn-19-P1989_1004688:49-nf] as we explained above.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"16.

If Christ then did not chide because He was called good, it must have been because He was called \"good Master.\" Further the manner of His reproof shews that it was the disbelief of the questioner, rather than the name of master, or of good, which He resented.

For Christ, having come to them, and been slain by them, has the more become the King of others, whom He did not see in the flesh. Whence our King Himself says through the prophecy of a certain psalm, \"Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people; Thou wilt make me head of the nations.

Did Abraham impugn the word of God, when he was promised the inheritance of the Gentiles, and an abiding posterity as many as the sand or the stars for multitude? To the reverent faith, which trusts implicitly on the omnipotence of God, the limits of human weakness are no barrier. Despising all that is feeble and earthly in itself, it believes the divine promise, even though it exceeds the possibilities of human nature. It knows that the laws which govern man are no hindrance to the power of God, Who is as bountiful in the performance as He is gracious in the promise. Nothing is more righteous than Faith. For as in human conduct it iS equity and self-restraint that receive our approval, so in the case of God, what is more righteous for man than to ascribe omnipotence to Him, Whose Power He perceives to be without limits?","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":10,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"164","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"In his prayer, with a song, to whom but the Lord Christ does he say, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy hearing, and was afraid: O Lord, I have considered Thy works, and was greatly afraid?\"[fn-34-P3443_1866826:40-nf] What is this but the inexpressible admiration of the foreknown, new, and sudden salvation of men? \"In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be recognized.\" What is this but either between the two testaments, or between the two thieves, or between Moses and Elias talking with Him on the mount? \"While the years draw nigh, Thou wilt be recognized; at the coming of the time Thou wilt be shown,\" does not even need exposition. \"While my soul shall be troubled at Him, in wrath Thou wilt be mindful of mercy.\" What is this but that He puts Himself for the Jews, of whose nation He was, who were troubled with great anger and crucified Christ, when He, mindful of mercy, said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do?[fn-34-P3444_1867580:41-nf] \"God shall come from Teman, and the Holy One from the shady and close mountain.\"[fn-34-P3445_1867683:42-nf] What is said here, \"He shall come from Teman,\" some interpret \"from the south,\" or \"from the southwest,\" by which is signified the noonday, that is, the fervor of charity and the splendor of truth. \"The shady and close mountain\" might be understood in many ways, yet I prefer to take it as meaning the depth of the divine Scriptures, in which Christ is prophesied: for in the Scriptures there are many things shady and close which exercise the mind of the reader; and Christ comes thence when he who has understanding finds Him there. \"His power covereth up the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise.\" What is this but what is also said in the psalm, \"Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory above all the earth?\"[fn-34-P3446_1868439:43-nf] \"His splendor shall be as the light.\" What is it but that the fame of Him shall illuminate believers? \"Horns are in His hands.\" What is this but the trophy of the cross? \"And He hath placed the firm charity of His strength\"[fn-34-P3447_1868685:44-nf] needs no exposition. \"Before His face shall go the word, and it shall go forth into the field after His feet.\" What is this but that He should both be announced before His coming hither and after His return hence? \"He stood, and the earth was moved.\" What is this but that \"He stood\" for succor, \"and the earth was moved\" to believe? \"He regarded, and the nations melted;\" that is, He had compassion, and made the people penitent. \"The mountains are broken with violence;\" that is, through the power of those who work miracles the pride of the haughty is broken \"The everlasting hills flowed down;\" that is, they are humbled in time that they may be lifted up for eternity. \"I saw His goings [made] eternal for his labors;\" that is, I beheld His labor of love not left without the reward of eternity. \"The tents of Ethiopia shall be greatly afraid, and the tents of the land of Midian\" that is, even those nations which are not under the Roman authority, being suddenly terrified by the news of Thy wonderful works, shall become a Christian people. \"Wert Thou angry at the rivers, O Lord? or was Thy fury against the rivers? or was Thy rage against the sea?

For when many people are troubled, he saw the threatening tribulation of the Church, and at once acknowledged himself a member of it, and said, \"I shall rest in the day of tribulation,\" as being one of those Who are rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.[fn-34-P3453_1873667:50-nf] \"That I may ascend,\" he says, \"among the people of my pilgrimage,\" departing quite from the wicked people of his carnal kinship, who are not pilgrims in this earth, and do not seek the country above.[fn-34-P3454_1873886:51-nf] \"Although the fig-tree,\" he says, \"shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall lie, and the fields shall yield no meat; the sheep shall be cut off from the meat, and there shall be no oxen in the stalls.\" He sees that nation which was to slay Christ about to lose the abundance of spiritual supplies, which, in prophetic fashion, he has set forth by the figure of earthly plenty.

All things are advancing towards an end, but that end is a condition of rest in the perfection, which is the goal of their advance, and not their abolition. Further, all things exist for the sake of the end, but the end itself is not the means to anything beyond: it is an ultimate, all-embracing whole, which rests in itself. And because it is self-contained, and works for no other time or object than itself, the goal is always that to which our hopes are directed. Therefore the Lord exhorts us to wait with patient and reverent faith until the end comes: Blessed is He that endureth to the end[fn-22-P2234_1429478:45-nf] . It is not a blessed dissolution, which awaits us, nor is non-existence the fruit, and annihilation the appointed reward of faith: but the end is the final attainment of the promised blessedness, and they are blessed who endure until the goal of perfect happiness is reached, when the expectation of faithful hope has no object beyond.

What of our expectation in heaven, if for us as well as for the wicked the end is a cessation of being? But even if there remains for the saints an expectation. whereas for the wicked there waits the end they have deserved, we cannot conceive that end as a final dissolution. What punishment would it be for the wicked to be beyond the feeling of avenging torments, because the capability of suffering has been removed by dissolution?

In all things, indeed, not only ought our own eye to be kept fixed upon the end of the commandment, which is \"charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,\"[fn-28-P2840_1306179:15-nf] to which we should make all that we utter refer; but in like manner ought the gaze of the person whom we are instructing by our utterance to be moved[fn-28-P2841_1306347:16-nf] toward the same, and guided in that direction. And, in truth, for no other reason were all those things which we read in the Holy Scriptures written, previous to the Lord's advent, but for this,-namely, that His advent might be pressed upon the attention, and that the Church which was to be, should be intimated beforehand, that is to say, the people of God throughout all nations; which Church is His body, wherewith also are united and numbered all the saints who lived in this world, even before His advent, and who believed then in His future coming, just as we believe in His past coming. For (to use an illustration) Jacob, at the time when he was being born, first put forth from the womb a hand, with which also he held the foot of the brother who was taking priority of him in the act of birth; and next indeed the head followed, and thereafter, at last, and as matter of course, the rest of the members:[fn-28-P2842_1307354:17-nf] while, nevertheless the head in point of dignity and power has precedence, not only of those members which followed it then, but also of the very hand which anticipated it in the process of the birth, and is really the first, although not in the matter of the time of appearing, at least in the order of nature. And in an analogous manner, the Lord Jesus Christ, previous to His appearing in the fiesta, and coming forth in a certain manner out of the womb of His secrecy, before the eyes of men as Man, the Mediator between God and men,[fn-28-P2843_1307912:18-nf] \"who is over all, God blessed for ever,\"[fn-28-P2844_1307972:19-nf] sent before Him, in the person of the holy patriarchs and prophets, a certain portion of His body, wherewith, as by a hand, He gave token beforetime of His own approaching birth, and also supplanted[fn-28-P2845_1308188:20-nf] the people who were prior to Him in their pride, using for that purpose the bonds of the law, as if they were His five fingers. For through five epochs of times[fn-28-P2846_1308445:21-nf] there was no cessation in the foretelling and prophesying of His own destined coming; and in a manner consonant with this, he through whom the law was given wrote five books; and proud men, who were carnally minded, and sought to \"establish their own righteousness,\"[fn-28-P2847_1308737:22-nf] were not filled with blessing by the open hand of Christ, but were debarred from such good by the hand compressed and closed; and therefore their feet were tied, and \"they fell, while we are risen, and stand upright.\"[fn-28-P2848_1308971:23-nf] But although, as I have said, the Lord Christ did thus send before Him a certain portion of His body, in the person of those holy men who came before Him as regards the time of birth, nevertheless He is Himself the Head of the body, the Church,[fn-28-P2849_1309232:24-nf] and all these have been attached to that same body of which He is the head, in virtue of their believing in Him whom they announced prophetically. For they were: not sundered (from that body) in consequence of fulfilling their course before Him, but rather were they made one with the same by reason of their obedience. For although the hand may be put forward away before the head, still it has its connection beneath the head.

Faustus has an evasive objection, which he no doubt thinks a most ingenious way of eluding the force of the clearest evidence of prophecy, but of which one is unwilling to take any notice, because answering it may give it an appearance of importance which it does not really possess. What could be more irrational than to say that it is weak faith which will not believe in Christ without evidence? Do our adversaries, then, believe in testimony about Christ? Faustus wishes us to believe the voice from heaven as distinguished from human testimony. But did they hear this voice? Has not the knowledge of it come to us through human testimony? The apostle describes the transmission of this knowledge, when he says: \"How shall they call on Him on whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written, \"How beautiful are the feet of them who publish peace, who bring good tidings!\"[fn-15-P1502_809442:80-nf] Clearly, in the preaching of the apostles there was a reference to prophetic testimony.

The testimony of prophets who lived so long before could not be ascribed to magical arts.

They have not tasted it. For they hope in themselves, not in Him; and therefore God's abundant sweetness is hidden from them. They fear God, indeed, but it is with that servile fear \"which is not in love; for perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-42-P4259_2327492:67-nf] Therefore to them that hope in Him He perfecteth His sweetness, inspiring them with His own love, so that with a holy fear, which love does not cast out, but which endureth for ever, they may, when they glory, glory in the Lord.

But if God conceals His sweetness from them that fear Him in the sense that these our objectors fancy, so that men's ignorance of His purpose of mercy towards the wicked may lead them to fear Him and live better, and so that there may be prayer made for those who are not living as they ought, how then does He perfect His sweetness to them that hope in Him, since, if their dreams be true, it is this very sweetness which will prevent Him from punishing those who do not hope in Him?

Well, says he, but was it not above all things that they might preach the other god? Rather[fn-51-P5144_1616043:312-nf] (that they might preach) that very self-same God, whose scripture they were with all their might fulfilling! \"Depart ye, depart ye,\" exclaims Isaiah; \"go ye out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing,\" that is blasphemy against Christ; \"Go ye out of the midst of her,\" even of the synagogue\" Be ye separate who bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-51-P5145_1616406:313-nf] For already had the Lord, according to the preceding words (of the prophet), revealed His Holy One with His arm, that is to say, Christ by His mighty power, in the eyes of the nations, so that all the[fn-51-P5146_1616628:314-nf] nations and the utmost parts of the earth have seen the salvation, which was from God. By thus departing from Judaism itself, when they exchanged the obligations and burdens of the law for the liberty of the gospel, they were fulfilling the psalm, \"Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast away their yoke from us; \"and this indeed (they did) after that \"the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain devices; \"after that \"the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took their counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.\"[fn-51-P5147_1617197:315-nf] What did the apostles thereupon suffer?

Then why does the Creator, if an adversary of Christ, not only predict that the apostles should incur this suffering, but even express His displeasure[fn-51-P5148_1617587:316-nf] thereat? For He ought neither to predict the course of the other god, whom, as you contend, He knew not, nor to have expressed displeasure at that which He had taken care to bring about. \"See how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and how merciful men are taken away, and no man considereth. For the righteous man has been removed from the evil person.\"[fn-51-P5149_1617980:317-nf] Who is this but Christ? \"Come, say they, let us take away the righteous, because He is not for our turn, (and He is clean contrary to our doings).\"[fn-51-P5150_1618149:318-nf] Premising, therefore, and likewise subjoining the fact that Christ suffered, He foretold that His just ones should suffer equally with Him-both the apostles and all the faithful in succession; and He signed them with that very seal of which Ezekiel spake: \"The Lord said unto me, Go through the gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark <i>tau upon the foreheads of the men.\"[fn-51-P5151_1618567:319-nf] Now the Greek letter <i>tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads in the true Catholic Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5152_1619095:320-nf] in which, according to the twenty-first Psalm, the brethren of Christ or children of God would ascribe glory to God the Father, in the person of Christ Himself addressing His Father; \"I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto Thee.\" For that which had to come to pass in our day in His name, and by His Spirit, He rightly foretold would be of Him. And a little afterwards He says: \"My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation.\"[fn-51-P5153_1619694:321-nf] In the sixty-seventh Psalm He says again: \"In the congregations bless ye the Lord God.\"[fn-51-P5154_1619807:322-nf] So that with this agrees also the prophecy of Malachi: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; neither will I accept your offerings: for from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place sacrifice shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering\"[fn-51-P5155_1620161:323-nf] -such as the ascription of glory, and blessing, and praise, and hymns.

Accordingly it remains that if we are to believe that the Lord Jesus, in this prayer, prayed for all of His own who either then were or should thereafter be in this life, which is a state of trial upon earth,[fn-35-P3525_1955083:14-nf] we must so understand the expression, \"through their word,\" as to believe that it here signified the word of faith itself which they preached in the world, and that it was called their word because it was primarily and principally preached by them. For it was already in the course of being preached by them in the earth when Paul received that same word of theirs by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whence also it came about that he compared the Gospel with them, lest by any means he had run, or should run, in vain; and they gave him their right hand because in him also they found, although not given him by them, their own word which they were already preaching, and in which they were now established.[fn-35-P3526_1955990:15-nf] And in regard to this word of the resurrection of Christ, it is said by the same apostle, \"Whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so ye believed;\"[fn-35-P3527_1956164:16-nf] and again, \"This is the word of faith,\" he says, \"which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-35-P3528_1956412:17-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles we read that in Christ, God hath marked out [the ground of] faith unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.[fn-35-P3529_1956585:18-nf] Accordingly, this word of faith, because principally and primarily preached by the apostles who adhered to Him, was called their word. Not, however, on that account does it cease to be the word of God because it is called their word; for the same apostle says that the Thessalonians received it from him \"not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God.\"[fn-35-P3530_1956977:19-nf] \"Of God,\" for the very reason that it was freely given by God; but called \"their word,\" because primarily and principally committed to them by God to be preached. In the same way also the thief mentioned above had in the matter of his own faith their word, which was called theirs precisely because the preaching of it primarily and principally pertained to the office they filled. And once more, when murmuring arose among the Grecian widows in reference to the serving of the tables, previous to the time when Paul was brought to the faith of Christ, the reply given by the apostles, who before then had adhered to the Lord, was: \"It is not good that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\"[fn-35-P3531_1957704:20-nf] Then it was that they provided for the ordination of deacons, that they themselves might not be drawn aside from the duty of preaching the word. Hence that was properly enough called their word which is the word of faith, whereby all, from whatever quarter they had heard it, believed on Christ, or, as yet to hear it, should thereafter believe. In this prayer, therefore, all whom He redeemed, whether then alive or thereafter to live in the flesh, were prayed for by our Redeemer when, praying for the apostles who were then with Him, He also conjoined those who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But what, after such conjunction, He then proceeds to say, must be reserved for discussion in another discourse.","title":"Tractate CIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_12_book_i_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"134","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"48.

He then selected twenty thousand armed men from among his troops, and sent them towards the Tigris, in order that they might guard those regions, and also be ready to join him, in case he should require their assistance.

Unless Christ had considered this Sabbath-which in your want of knowledge and of piety you laugh at-one of the prophecies written of Himself, He would not have borne such a testimony to it as He did. For when, as you say in praise of Christ, He suffered voluntarily, and so could choose His own time for suffering and for resurrection, He brought it about that His body rested from all its works on Sabbath in the tomb, and that His resurrection on the third day. which we call the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, and therefore the eighth, proved the circumcision of the eighth day to be also prophetical of Him. For what does circumcision mean, but the eradication of the mortality which comes from our carnal generation? So the apostle says: \"Putting off from Himself His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers, triumphing over them in Himself.\"[fn-17-P1736_979119:52-nf] The flesh here said to be put off is that mortality of flesh on account of which the body is properly called flesh. The flesh is the mortality, for in the immortality of the resurrection there will be no flesh; as it is written, \"Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\" You are accustomed to argue from these words against our faith in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, which has already taken place in the Lord Himself. You keep out of view the following words, in which the apostle explains his meaning. To show what he here means by flesh, he adds, \"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" For this body, which from its mortality is properly called flesh, is changed in the resurrection, so as to be no longer corruptible and mortal. This is the apostle's statement, and not a supposition of ours, as his next words prove. \"Lo\" he says, \"I show you a mystery: we shall all use again, but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the last trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-17-P1737_980339:53-nf] To put on immortality, the body puts off mortality. This is the mystery of circumcision, which by the law took place on the eighth day; and on the eighth day, the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, was fulfilled in its true meaning by the Lord. Hence it is said, \"Putting off His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers.\" For by means of this mortality the hostile powers of hell ruled over us. Christ is said to have made a show or example of these, because in Himself, our Head, He gave an example which will be fully realized in the liberation of His whole body, the Church, from the power of the devil at the last resurrection. This is our faith. And according to the prophetic declaration quoted by Paul, \"The just shall live by faith.\" This is our justification.[fn-17-P1738_981146:54-nf] Even Pagans believe that Christ died. But only Christians believe that Christ rose again. \"If thou confess with thy mouth,\" says the apostle, \"that Jesus is the Lord, and believest in thy heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-17-P1739_981431:55-nf] Again, because we are justified by faith in Christ's resurrection, the apostle says, \"He died for our offenses, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-17-P1740_981598:56-nf] And because this resurrection by faith in which we are justified was prefigured by the circumcision of the eighth day, the apostle says of Abraham, with whom the observance began, \"He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith.\"[fn-17-P1741_981874:57-nf] Circumcision, then, is one of the prophecies of Christ, written by Moses, of whom Christ said, \"He wrote of me.\" In the words of the Lord, \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,\"[fn-17-P1742_982214:58-nf] it is not the circumcision of the proselyte which is meant, but his imitation of the conduct of the scribes and Pharisees, which the Lord forbids His disciples to imitate, when He says: \"The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat: what they say unto you, do; but do not after their works; for they say, and do not.\"[fn-17-P1743_982554:59-nf] These words of the Lord teach us both the honor due to the teaching of Moses, in whose seat even bad men were obliged to teach good things, and the reason of the proselyte becoming a child of hell, which was not that he heard from the Pharisees the words of the law, but that he copied their example. Such a circumcised proselyte might have been addressed in the words of Paul: \"Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law.\"[fn-17-P1744_983011:60-nf] His imitation of the Pharisees in not keeping the law made him a child of hell. And he was twofold more than they, probably because of his neglecting to fulfill what he voluntarily undertook, when, not being born a Jew, he chose to become a Jew.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_30_on_the_creed_a_sermon_to_the_catechumens_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1.

But whoso through the Law have come to know them, (\"For through the Law is the knowledge of sin,\"[fn-35-P3597_1700149:17-nf] and, \"Lust,\" saith he, \"I knew not, unless the Law should say, Thou shalt not lust after,\"[fn-35-P3598_1700259:18-nf] and yet are overcome by their assault, because they live under the Law, whereby what is good is commanded, but not also given: they live not under Grace, which gives through the Holy Spirit what is commanded through the Law: unto these the Law therefore entered, that in them the offense might abound. The prohibition increased the lust, and made it unconquered:[fn-35-P3599_1700653:19-nf] that there might be transgression also, which without the Law was not, although there was sin, \"For where there is not Law, neither is there transgression.\"[fn-36-P3600_1700828:20-nf] Thus the Law, Grace not helping, forbidding sin, became over and above the strength of sin; whence the Apostle saith, \"The Law is the strength of sin.\"[fn-36-P3601_1700998:21-nf] Nor is it to be wondered at, that man's weakness even from the good Law added strength to evil, whilst it trusts to fulfill the Law itself of its own strength.

Now this will be the very perfection of divine power to effect the salvation (of man) in a nature like his own,[fn-78-P7834_2232890:648-nf] For it would be no great matter if the Spirit of God remedied the flesh; but when a flesh, which is the very copy[fn-78-P7835_2233017:649-nf] of the sinning substance-itself flesh also-only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a great thing). The likeness, therefore, will have reference to the quality[fn-78-P7836_2233215:650-nf] of the sinfulness, and not to any falsity[fn-78-P7837_2233273:651-nf] of the substance. Because he would not have added the attribute \"sinful,\"[fn-78-P7838_2233365:652-nf] if he meant the \"likeness\" to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case he would only have used the word \"flesh,\" and omitted the \"sinful.\" But inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said \"sinful flesh,\" (or \"flesh of sin,\")[fn-78-P7839_2234360:653-nf] he has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose[fn-78-P7840_2234533:654-nf] that the likeness was predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition[fn-78-P7841_2234765:655-nf] with our own; but true still, as being of a nature[fn-78-P7842_2234831:656-nf] not really unlike ours.[fn-78-P7843_2235083:657-nf] And again, in contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness. The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he would not have us \"live in the flesh,\" although in the flesh-even by not living in the works of the flesh[fn-78-P7846_2236549:660-nf] -he shows that when he wrote the words, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-78-P7847_2236670:661-nf] it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,[fn-78-P7848_2236925:662-nf] not on the substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if \"the body indeed is dead because of sin\" (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the body), \"but the spirit is life because of righteousness,\"[fn-78-P7849_2237246:663-nf] it follows that this life accrues to that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the body[fn-78-P7850_2237401:664-nf] is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: \"He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\"[fn-78-P7851_2237664:665-nf] In these words he both affirmed the resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called[fn-78-P7852_2237793:666-nf] body, nor can anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God. So says the Creator's Psalmist: \"It is better to hope in the Lord, than to hope even in princes.\"[fn-78-P7870_2243623:684-nf] \"Patient in tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7871_2243671:685-nf] You have (this in) the Psalm: \"The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7872_2243770:686-nf] \"Bless, and curse not,\"[fn-78-P7873_2243812:687-nf] (says your apostle.) But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things, and blessed them? \"Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\"[fn-78-P7874_2244046:688-nf] For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces a woe.[fn-78-P7875_2244123:689-nf] \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\"[fn-78-P7876_2244180:690-nf] (Like unto which is the Creator's precept: ) \"Thou shalt not remember thy brother's evil against thee.\"[fn-78-P7877_2244305:691-nf] (Again: ) \"Avenge not yourselves; \"[fn-78-P7878_2244366:692-nf] for it is written, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"[fn-78-P7879_2244457:693-nf] \"Live peaceably with all men.\"[fn-78-P7880_2244538:694-nf] The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense. Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion's god (after all).[fn-78-P7882_2245034:696-nf] If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator's Christ, what is the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it? \"[fn-78-P7883_2245389:697-nf] In vain has (our man of) Pontus laboured to deny this statement.[fn-78-P7884_2245474:698-nf] If the gospel has not fulfilled the law, then all I can say is,[fn-78-P7885_2245698:699-nf] the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the Father \"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-78-P7832_2232206:646-nf] it must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom.

Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God. So says the Creator's Psalmist: \"It is better to hope in the Lord, than to hope even in princes.\"[fn-78-P7870_2243623:684-nf] \"Patient in tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7871_2243671:685-nf] You have (this in) the Psalm: \"The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7872_2243770:686-nf] \"Bless, and curse not,\"[fn-78-P7873_2243812:687-nf] (says your apostle.) But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things, and blessed them? \"Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\"[fn-78-P7874_2244046:688-nf] For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces a woe.[fn-78-P7875_2244123:689-nf] \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\"[fn-78-P7876_2244180:690-nf] (Like unto which is the Creator's precept: ) \"Thou shalt not remember thy brother's evil against thee.\"[fn-78-P7877_2244305:691-nf] (Again: ) \"Avenge not yourselves; \"[fn-78-P7878_2244366:692-nf] for it is written, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"[fn-78-P7879_2244457:693-nf] \"Live peaceably with all men.\"[fn-78-P7880_2244538:694-nf] The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense. Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion's god (after all).[fn-78-P7882_2245034:696-nf] If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator's Christ, what is the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it? \"[fn-78-P7883_2245389:697-nf] In vain has (our man of) Pontus laboured to deny this statement.[fn-78-P7884_2245474:698-nf] If the gospel has not fulfilled the law, then all I can say is,[fn-78-P7885_2245698:699-nf] the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_33_of_holy_virginity_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"41.

And after the same fashion He is also called the Logos,[fn-64-P6405_1035951:185-nf] because He takes away from us all that is irrational, and makes us truly reasonable, so that we do all things, even to eating and drinking, to the glory of God, and discharge by the Logos to the glory of God both the commoner functions of life and those which belong to a more advanced stage. For if, by having part in Him, we are raised up and enlightened, herded also it may be and ruled over, then it is clear that we become in a divine manner reasonable, when He drives away from us what in us is irrational and dead, since He is the Logos (reason) and the Resurrection.Consider, however, whether all men have in some way part in Him in His character as Logos. On this point tile Apostle teaches us that He is to be sought not outside the seeker, and that those find Him in themselves who set their heart on doing so; \"Say not[fn-64-P6406_1036963:186-nf] in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down; or, Who shall descend into the abyss? That is to bring Christ up from the dead. But what saith the Scripture? The Word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,\" as if Christ Himself were the same thing as the Word said to be sought after. But when the Lord Himself says[fn-64-P6407_1037336:187-nf] \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin,\" the only sense we can find in His words is that the Logos Himself says that those are not chargeable with sin to whom He (reason) has not fully come, but that those, if they sin, are guilty who, having had part in Him, act contrary to the ideas by which He declares His full presence in us. Only when thus read is the saying true: \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin.\" Should the words be applied, as many are of opinion that they should, to the visible Christ, then how is it true that those had no sin to whom He did not come? In that case all who lived before the advent of the Saviour will be free from sin, since Jesus, as seen in flesh, had not yet come. And more-all those to whom He has never been preached will have no sin, and if they have no sin, then it is clear they are not liable to judgment. But the Logos in man, in which we have said that our whole race had part, is spoken of in two senses; first, in that of the filling up of ideas which takes place, prodigies excepted, in every one who passes beyond the age of boyhood, but secondly, in that of the consummation, which takes place only in the perfect. The words, therefore, \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin,\" are to be understood in the former sense; but the words,[fn-64-P6408_1038800:188-nf] \"All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear them,\" in the latter. For before the consummation of reason comes, there is nothing in man but what is blameworthy; all is imperfect and defective, and can by no means command the obedience of those irrational elements in us which are tropically spoken of as sheep. And perhaps the former meaning is to be recognized in the words \"The Logos was made flesh,\" but the second in \"The Logos was God.\" We must accordingly look at what there is to be seen in human affairs between the saying, \"The Word (reason) was made flesh\" and \"The Word was God.\" When the Word was made flesh can we say that it was to some extent broken up and thinned out, and can we say that it recovered from that point onward till it became again what it was at first, God the Word, the Word with the Father; the Word whose glory John saw, the verily only-begotten, as from the Father. But the Son may also be the Logos (Word), because He reports the secret things of His Father who is intellect in the same way as the Son who is called the Word. For as with us the word is a messenger of those things which tile mind perceives, so the Word of God, knowing the Father, since no created being can approach Him without a guide, reveals the Father whom He knows. For no one knows the Father save the Son,[fn-64-P6409_1040172:189-nf] and he to whomsoever the Son reveals Him, and inasmuch as He is the Word He is the Messenger of Great Counsel,[fn-64-P6410_1040304:190-nf] who has the government upon His shoulders; for He entered on His kingdom by enduring the cross. In the Apocalypse,[fn-64-P6411_1040441:191-nf] moreover, the Faithful and True (the Word), is said to sit on a white horse, the epithets indicating, I consider, the clearness of the voice with which the Word of truth speaks to us when He sojourns among us. This is scarcely the place to show how the word \"horse\" is often used in passages spoken for our encouragement in sacred learning. I only cite two of these: \"A horse is deceitful for safety,\"[fn-64-P6412_1040859:192-nf] and \"Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will rejoice in the name of the Lord our God.\"[fn-64-P6413_1040984:193-nf] Nor must we leave unnoticed a passage in the forty-fourth Psalm,[fn-64-P6414_1041068:194-nf] frequently quoted by many writers as if they understood it: \"My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King.\" Suppose it is God the Father who speaks thus; what is His heart, that the good word should appear in accordance with His heart? If, as these writers suppose, the Word (Logos) needs no interpretation, then the heart is to be taken in the natural sense too. But it is quite absurd to suppose God's heart to be a part of Him as ours is of our body. We must remind such writers that as when the hand of God is spoken of, and His arm and His finger, we do not read the words literally but enquire in what sound sense we may take them so as to be worthy of God, so His heart is to be understood of His rational power, by which He disposes all things, and His word of that which announces what is in this heart of His. But who is it that announces the counsel of the Father to those of His creatures who are worthy and who have risen above themselves, who but the Saviour? That \"belched forth\" is not, perhaps, without significance; a hundred other terms might have been employed; \"My heart has produced a good word,\" it might have been said, or \"My heart has spoken a good word.\" But in belching, some wind that was hidden makes its way out to the world, and so it may be that the Father gives out views of truth not continuously, but as it were after the fashion of belching, and the word has the character of the things thus produced, and is called, therefore, the image of the invisible God. We may enter our agreement, therefore, with the ordinary acceptation of these words, and take them to be spoken by the Father. It is not, however, a matter of course, that it is God Himself who announces these things. Why should it not be a prophet? Filled with the Spirit and unable to contain himself, he brings forth a word about his prophecy concerning Christ: \"My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King, my pen is the tongue of a ready writer. Excellent in beauty is He beyond the sons of men.\" Then to the Christ Himself: \"Grace is poured out on Thy lips.\" If the Father were the speaker, how could He go on after the words, \"Grace is poured out on thy lips,\" to say, \"Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever,\" and a little further on, \"Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\" Some of those who wish to make the Father the speaker may appeal to the words, \"Hear, O daughter, and behold and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and thy father.\" The prophet, it may be said, could not address the Church in the words, \"Hear, O daughter.\" It is not difficult, however, to show that changes of person occur frequently in the Psalms, so that these words, \"Hear, O daughter,\" might be from the Father, in this passage, though the Psalm as a whole is not. To our discussion of the Word we may here add the passage,[fn-64-P6415_1044005:195-nf] \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens rounded, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth.\" Some refer this to the Saviour and the Holy Spirit. The passage, however, does not necessarily imply any more than that the heavens were founded by the reason (logos) of God, as when we say that a house is built by the plan (logos) of the architect, or a ship by the plan (logos) of the shipbuilder. In the same way the heavens were founded (made solid) by the Word of God, for they are[fn-64-P6416_1044520:196-nf] of a more divine substance, which on this account is called solid;[fn-64-P6417_1044615:197-nf] it has little fluidity for the most part, nor is it easily melted like other parts of the world, and specially the lower parts. On account of this difference the heavens are said in a special manner to be constituted by the Word of God.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"3. Which sentence dishonoreth the holy Martyrs, nay rather taketh away holy martyrdoms altogether. For they would do more justly and wisely, according to these men, not to confess to their persecutors that they were Christians, and by confessing make them murderers: but rather by telling a lie, and denying what they were, should both themselves keep safe the convenience of the flesh and purpose of the heart, and not allow those to accomplish the wickedness which they had conceived in their mind. For they were not their neighbors in the Christian faith, that with them it should be their duty to speak the truth in their mouth which they spake in their heart; but moreover enemies of Truth itself. For if Jehu (whom it seems they do prudently to single out unto themselves to look unto as an example of lying) falsely gave himself out for a servant of Baal, that he might slay Baal's servants: how much more justly, according to their perversity, might, in time of persecution, the servants of Christ falsely give themselves out, for servants of demons, that the servants of demons might not slay servants of Christ; and sacrifice to idols that men might not be killed, it Jehu sacrificed to Baal that he might kill men? For what harm would it do them, according to the egregious doctrine of these speakers of lies, if they should lyingly pretend a worship of the Devil in the body, when the worship of God was preserved in the heart? But not so have the Martyrs understood the Apostle, the true, the holy Martyrs.

As for that Jehu, by an impious lie and a sacrilegious sacrifice making inquisition for impious and sacrilegious men for to kill them, they would not imitate him, no, not though the Scripture had said nothing concerning him, what manner of man he was. But, seeing it is written that he had not his heart right with God;[fn-43-P4396_2124111:9-nf] what profited it him, that for some obedience which, concerning the utter destruction of the house of Ahab, he exhibited for the lust of his own domination. he received some amount of transitory wages in a temporal kingdom? Let, rather, the truth-telling sentence of the Martyrs be thine to defend: to this I exhort thee, my brother, that thou mayst be against liars, not say, that thou mayest find how needful to be shunned is that which, with laudable zeal indeed towards impious men, that they may be caught and corrected, or avoided, but yet too incautiously, is thought fit to be taught.4. Of lies are many sorts, which indeed all, universally, we ought to hate. For there is no lie that is not contrary to truth. For, as light and darkness, piety and impiety, judge and iniquity, sin and right-doing, heath and weakness, life and death, so are truth and a lie contrary the one to the other. Whence by how much we love the former, by so much ought we to hate the latter. Yet in truth there be some lies which to believe does no harm: although even by such son of lie to wish to deceive, is hurtful to him that tells it, not to him that believes it. As though, if that brother, the servant of God, Fronto, in the information which he gave thee, should (though far be the thought!) say some things falsely; he would have hurt himself assuredly, not thee, although thou, without iniquity of thine, hadst believed all, upon his telling it. Because, whether those things did so take place or not so, yet they have not any thing, which if a person believe to have been so, though it were not so, he by the rule of truth and doctrine of eternal salvation should be judged worthy of blame. Whereas, if a person tell a lie which if any believe he will be an heretic against the doctrine of Christ, by so much is he who tells the lie more hurtful, by how much he that believes it is more miserable. See then, what manner of thing it is, if against the doctrine of Christ we shall tell a lie which whoso believes shall perish, in order that we may catch the enemies of the same doctrine, to the end we may bring them to the truth, while we recede from it; nay rather, when we catch liars by lying, teach worse lies. For it is one thing what they say when they lie, another when they are deceived. For, when they teach their heresy, they speak the things in which they are deceived; but when they say that they think what they do not think, or that they do not think what they do think, they say the things in perisheth not. For it is no receding from the catholic rule, if, when a heretic lyingly professes the catholic doctrines, one believes him to be a catholic: and therefore it is not pernicious to him; because he is mistaken in the mind of a man, of which, when latent, he cannot judge, not in the faith of God which it is his duty to keep safe planted within him. Moreover, when they teach their heresy, whoso shall believe them, in thinking it truth, will be partaker, as of their error, so of their damnation. So it comes to pass, that when they fable their nefarious dogmas in which they are with deadly error deceived, then whoso believeth them is lost: whereas when we preach catholic dogmas, in which we hold the right faith, then if he shall believe, that man is found, whoso was lost. But when, they being Priscillianists, do, in order that they may not betray their venom, lyingly give themselves out to be of us; whoever of us believes them, even while they escape detection, himself perseveres a Catholic: we on the other hand, if, in order to attain to the discovery of them, we falsely give ourselves out for Priscillianists, because we shall praise their dogmas as though they were our own, whoso shall believe the same, will either be confirmed among them, or will be transferred to them in the meantime straightway: but what the coming hour may bring forth, whether they shall be afterwards set free therefrom by us when speaking true things, who were deceived by us when speaking false; and whether they will be willing to hear one teaching whom they have thus experienced telling a lie,who can know for certain? who can be ignorant that this is uncertain? Whence it is gathered, that it is more pernicious, or to speak more mildly, that it is more perilous for Catholics to lie that they may catch heretics, than for heretics to lie that they may not be found out by Catholics.s. Because, whoso believes Catholics when they tall a lie to tempt people, is either made or confirmed a heretic; but whoso believes heretics when they tall a lie to conceal themselves, doth not cease to be a Catholic. But that this may become more plain, let us propose some cases by way of example, and from those writings in preference which thou hast sent me to read.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"13.

The question is whether evil, also, was made through the Logos, taking the Logos, now be it well noted, in the sense of that reason which is in every one, as thus brought into being by the reason which was from the beginning. The Apostle says:[fn-64-P6489_1094465:40-nf] \"Without the law sin was dead,\" and adds, \"But when the commandment came sin revived,\" and so teaches generally about sin that it has no power before the law and the commandment (but the Logos is, in a sense, law and commandment), and there would be no sin were there no law, for,[fn-64-P6490_1094767:41-nf] \"sin is not imputed where there is no law.\" And, again, there would be no sin but for the Logos, for \"if I had not come and spoken unto them,\" Christ says,[fn-64-P6491_1094940:42-nf] \"they had not had sin.\" For every excuse is taken away from one who wants to make excuse for his sin, if, though the Word is in him and shows him what he ought to do, he does not obey it. It seems, them, that all things, the worse things not excepted, were made by the Logos, and without Him, taking the nothing here in its simpler sense, was nothing made. Nor must we blame the Logos if all things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made, any more than we blame the master who has showed the pupil his duty, when the instruction has been such as to leave the pupil, should he sin, no excuse or room to say that he erred through ignorance. This appears the more plainly when we consider that master and pupil are inseparable. For as master and pupil are correlatives, and belong together, so the Logos is present in the nature of reasonable beings as such, always suggesting what they ought to do, even should we pay no heed to his commands, but devote ourselves to pleasure and allow his best counsels to pass by us unregarded. As the eye is a servant given us for the best purposes, and yet we use it to see things on which it is wrong for us to look, and as we make a wrong use of our hearing when we spend our time in listening to singing competitions and to other forbidden sounds, so we outrage the Logos who is in us, and use Him otherwise than as we ought, when we make Him assist in our transgressions. For He is present with those who sin, for their condemnation, and He condemns the man who does not prefer Him to everything else. Hence we find it written:[fn-64-P6492_1096537:43-nf] \"The word which I have spoken unto you, the same shall judge you.\" That is as if He should say: \"I, the Word, who am always lifting up my voice in you, I, myself, will judge you, and no refuge or excuse will then be left you.\" This interpretation. however, may appear somewhat strained, as we have taken the Word in one sense to be the Word in the beginning, who was with God, God the Word, and have now taken it in another sense, speaking of it, not only in reference to the principal works of creation, as in the words, \"All things were made through Him,\" but as related to all the acts of reasonable beings, this last being the Logos (reason), without whose presence none of our sins are committed. The question arises whether the Logos in us is to be pronounced the same being as that which was in the beginning and was with God, God the Word. The Apostle, certainly, does not appear to make the Logos in us a different being from the Logos who was in the beginning with God. \"Say not in thine heart,\" he says,[fn-64-P6493_1097571:44-nf] \"who shall go up into heaven; that is to bring Christ down, or who shall go down into the abyss; that is to bring Christ up from the dead.

It is true that it is not my opinion about him that you have asked for, but that of the holy martyr Pamphilus; and you have requested to have the book which he is said to have written in his defence in Greek translated for you into Latin: nevertheless I do not doubt that there will be some who will think themselves aggrieved if I say anything in his defence even in the words of another man. I beg them to do nothing in the spirit of presumption and of prejudice; and, since we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, not to refuse to hear the truth spoken, lest haply they should do wrong through ignorance. Let them consider that to wound the consciences of their weaker brethren by false accusations is to sin against Christ; and therefore let them not lend their ears to the accusers, nor seek an account of another man's faith from a third party, especially when an opportunity is given them for gaining personal and direct knowledge, and the substance and quality of each man's faith is to be known by his own confession. For so the Scripture says:[fn-84-P8446_2067059:2-nf] \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\": and:[fn-84-P8447_2067184:3-nf] \"By his words shall each man be justified, and by his word shall he be condemned.\" The opinions of Origen in the various parts of Scripture are clearly set forth in the present work: as to the cause of our finding certain places in which he contradicts himself, an explanation will be offered in the short document subjoined.[fn-84-P8448_2067528:4-nf] But as for myself, I hold that which has been handed down to us from the holy fathers, namely, that the Holy Trinity is coeternal, and of a single nature, virtue and substance; that the Son of God in these last times has been made man, has suffered for our transgressions and rose again from the dead in the very flesh in which he suffered, and thereby imparted the hope of the resurrection to the whole race of mankind. When we speak of the resurrection of the flesh, we do so, not with any subterfuges, as is slanderously reported by certain perons; we believe that it is this very flesh in which we are now living which will rise again, not one kind of flesh instead of another, nor another body than the body of this flesh. When we speak of the body rising we do so in the words of the apostle; for he himself made use of this word: and when we speak of the flesh, our confession is that of the Creed. It is an absurd invention of maliciousness to think that the human body is different from the flesh. However, whether we speak of that which is to rise, according to the common faith, as the flesh, or, according to the Apostle, as the body, this we must believe, that according to the clear statement of the Apostle, that which shall rise shall rise in power and in glory; it will rise an incorruptible and a spiritual body: for \"corruption cannot inherit incorruption.\" We must maintain this preëminence of the body, or flesh, which is to be: but, with this proviso, we must hold that the resurrection of the flesh is perfect and entire; we must on the one hand maintain the identity of the flesh, while on the other we must not detract from the dignity and glory of the incorruptible and spiritual body. For so the Scripture speaks. This is what is preached by the reverend Bishop John at Jerusalem; this we with him both confess and hold. If any one either believes or teaches otherwise, or insinuates that we believe differently from the exposition of our faith, let him be anathema. Let this then be taken as a record of our belief by any who desire to know it. Whatever we read and whatever we do is in accordance with this account of our faith; we follow the words of the Apostle,[fn-84-P8449_2069751:5-nf] \"proving all things holding fast that which is good, avoiding every form of evil.\"[fn-84-P8450_2069857:6-nf] \"And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and upon the Israel of God.\"","title":"Translation of Pamphilus' Defence of Origen.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":10,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_38_on_patience","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"17. Now this election the Apostle demonstrating to be, not of merits going before in good works, but election of grace, saith thus: \"And in this time a remnant by election of grace is saved. But if by grace, then is itno more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-47-P4787_2358854:46-nf] This is election of grace; that is, election in which through the grace of God men are elected: this, I say, is election of grace which goes before all good merits of men. For if it be to any good merits that it is given, then is it no more gratuitously given, but is paid as a debt, and consequently is not truly called grace; where \"reward,\" as the same Apostle saith, \"is not imputed as grace, but as debt.\"[fn-47-P4788_2359285:47-nf] Whereas if, that it may be true grace, that is, gratuitous, it find nothing inman to which it is due of merit, (which thing is well understood in that saying, \"Thou wiltsave them for nothing,\"[fn-47-P4789_2359495:48-nf] ) then assuredly itself gives the merits, not to merits is given. Consequently it goes before even faith, from which it is that all good works begin. \"For the just,\" as is written, \"shall live by faith.\"[fn-47-P4790_2359822:49-nf] But, moreover, grace not only assists the just, but also justifies the ungodly. And therefore even when it does aid the just and seems to be rendered to his merits, not even then does it cease to be grace, because that which it aids it did itself bestow. With a view therefore to this grace, which precedes all good merits of man, not only was Christ put to death by the ungodly, but \"died for the ungodly.\"[fn-47-P4791_2360249:50-nf] And ere that He died, He elected the Apostles, not of course then just, but to be justified: to whom He saith, \"I have chosen you out of the world.\" For to whom He said, \"Ye are not of the world,\" and then, lest they should account themselves never to have been of the world, presently added, \"But I have chosen you out of the world;\" assuredly that they should not be of the world was by His own election of them conferred upon them. Wherefore, if it had been through their own righteousness, not through His grace, that they were elected, they would not have been chosen out of the world, because they would already not be of the world if already they were just. And again, if the reason why they were elected was, that they were already just, they had already first chosen the Lord. For who can be righteous but by choosing righteousness? \"But the end of the law is Christ, for righteousness is to every one that believeth.[fn-47-P4792_2361192:51-nf] Who is made unto us wisdom of God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-47-P4793_2361368:52-nf] He then is Himself our righteousness.","title":"On Patience","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"They declare \"that we say that the law of the Old Testament was given not for the end that it might justify the obedient, but rather that it might become the cause of greater sin.\" Certainly, they do not understand what we say concerning the law; because we say what the apostle says, whom they do not understand. For who can say that they are not justified who are obedient to the law, when, unless they were justified, they could not be obedient? But we say, that by the law is effected that what God wills to be done is heard, but that by grace is effected that the law is obeyed. \"For not the hearers of the law,\" says the apostle, \"are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.\"[fn-53-P5386_2114498:1-nf] Therefore the law makes hearers of righteousness, grace makes doers. \"For what was impossible to the law,\" says the same apostle, \"in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.\"[fn-53-P5387_2114899:2-nf] This is what we say;-let them pray that they may one day understand it, and not dispute so as never to understand it.

Thus they remain either plainly wicked or deceitfully righteous,-manifestly cut off in open unrighteousness, or foolishly elated in fallacious righteousness. And by this means-marvellous indeed, but yet true-the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by the righteousness which is in the law, or by the law, but by that which is in the Spirit of grace. Because the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in those, as it is written, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. But, according to the righteousness which is in the law, the apostle says that he was blameless in the flesh, not in the Spirit; and he says that the righteousness which is of the law was his, not God's. It must be understood, therefore, that the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled according to the righteousness which is in the law or of the law, that is, according to the righteousness of man, but according to the righteousness which is in the Spirit of grace, therefore according to the righteousness of God, that is, which man has from God. Which may be thus more clearly and briefly stated: That the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled when the law commands, and man as it were of his own strength obeys; but when the Spirit aids, and man's free will, but freed by the grace of God, performs. Therefore the righteousness of the law is to command what is pleasing to God, to forbid what is displeasing; but the righteousness in the law is to obey the letter, and beyond it to seek for no assistance of God for holy living. For when he had said, \"Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ,\" he added, \"Which is from God.\" That, therefore, is itself the righteousness of God, being ignorant of which the proud go about to establish their own; for it is not called the righteousness of God because by it God is righteous, but because man has it from God.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"40.

And that you may know that he designated as theirs the righteousness which is of the law, and as God's that which man receives from God, hear what he says in another passage, when speaking of Christ: \"For whose sake I counted all things not only as loss, but I deemed them to be dung, that I might win Christ, and be found in Him-not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, which is of God.\"[fn-60-P6091_2362801:137-nf] Now what does he mean by \"not having my own righteousness, which is of the law,\" when the law is really not his at all, but God's,-except this, that he called it his own righteousness, although it was of the law, because he thought he could fulfil the law by his own will, without the aid of grace which is through faith in Christ? Wherefore, after saying, \"Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law,\" he immediately subjoined, \"But that which is through the faith of Christ, which is of God.\" This is what they were ignorant of, of whom he says, \"Being ignorant of God's righteousness,\"-that is, the righteousness which is of God (for it is given not by the letter, which kills, but by the life-giving Spirit), \"and wishing to establish their own righteousness,\" which he expressly described as the righteousness of the law, when he said, \"Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law;\" they were not subject to the righteousness of God,-in other words, they submitted not themselves to the grace of God. For they were under the law, not under grace, and therefore sin had dominion over them, from which a man is not freed by the law, but by grace. On which account he elsewhere says, \"For sin shall not have dominion over you; because ye are not under the law, but under grace.\"[fn-60-P6092_2364126:138-nf] Not that the law is evil; but because they are under its power, whom it makes guilty by imposing commandments, not by aiding.

And this is the meaning of the expression, that \"men have no excuse for their sin,\" viz., that, from the time the divine word or reason has begun to show them internally the difference between good and evil, they ought to avoid and guard against that which is wicked: \"For to him who knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.\"[fn-63-P6357_1167486:77-nf] Moreover, that all men are not without communion with God, is taught in the Gospel thus, by the Saviour's words: \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation; neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! but the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-63-P6358_1167752:78-nf] But here we must see whether this does not bear the same meaning with the expression in Genesis: \"And He breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\"[fn-63-P6359_1167955:79-nf] For if this be understood as applying generally to all men, then all men have a share in God.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_36_book_ii_of_the_canonical_system_of_the_nocturnal_prayers_and_psalms_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"For we have found that many in different countries, according to the fancy of their mind (having, indeed, as the Apostle says, \"a zeal, for God but not according to Knowledge\"[fn-20-P2001_873398:3-nf] , have made for themselves different rules and arrangements in this matter.

For when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted His garments among themselves, each casting lots for what he chose to have, and receiving according to the decision of the lot. And this very Psalm you maintain does not refer to Christ; for you are in all respects blind, and do not understand that no one in your nation who has been called King or Christ has ever had his hands or feet pierced while alive, or has died in this mysterious fashion-to wit, by the cross-save this Jesus alone.","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":10,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"170","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"These gifts, therefore, of God, which are given to the elect who are called according to\nGod's purpose, among which gifts is both the beginning of belief and perseverance in the faith to the\ntermination of this life, as I have proved by such a concurrent testimony of reasons and\nauthorities,-these gifts of God, I say, if there is no such predestination as I am maintaining, are\nnot foreknown by God. But they are foreknown. This, therefore, is the predestination which I\nmaintain.

For he was speaking of the remnant of the Jews which were saved, while the rest perished. For\nabove he had said that the prophet had declared to Israel, \"All day long I have stretched forth my\nhands to an unbelieving and a gainsaying people.\"[fn-71-P7197_2751790:118-nf] And as if it were answered, What, then, has\nbecome of the promises of God to Israel? he added in continuation, \"I say, then, has God cast away\nHis people? God forbid! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of\nBenjamin.\" Then he added the words which I am now treating: \"God hath not cast away His people whom\nHe foreknew.\" And in order to show that the remnant had been left by God's grace, not by any merits\nof their works, he went on to add, \"Know ye not what the Scripture saith in Elias, in what way he\nmaketh intercession with God against Israel? \"[fn-71-P7198_2752397:119-nf] and the rest. \"But what,\" says he, \"saith the\nanswer of God unto him? I` have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee\nbefore Baal.'\"[fn-71-P7199_2752583:120-nf] For He says not, \"There\nare left to me,\" or \"They have reserved themselves to me,\" but, \"I have reserved to myself.\" \"Even\nso, then, at this present time also there is made a remnant by the election of grace.

This is that election by which He elected those, whom He\nwilled, in Christ before the foundation of the world, that they should be holy and without spot in\nHis sight, in love, predestinating them unto the adoption of sons. No one, therefore, who understands\nthese things is permitted to doubt that, when the apostle says, \"God hath not cast away His people\nwhom He foreknew,\" He intended to signify predestination. For He foreknew the remnant which He should\nmake so according to the election of grace. That is, therefore, He predestinated them; for without\ndoubt He foreknew if He predestinated; but to have predestinated is to have foreknown that which He\nshould do.","title":"A Treatise on the Gift of\nPerseverance, Being the Second Book","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_40_oration_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"21.

That the place of baptism is sometimes supplied by martyrdom is supported by an argument by no means trivial, which the blessed Cyprian adduces[fn-36-P3607_2021632:127-nf] from the thief, to whom, though he was not baptized, it was yet said, \"To-day shall thou be with me in Paradise.\"[fn-36-P3608_2021775:128-nf] On considering which, again and again, I find that not only martyrdom for the sake of Christ may supply what was wanting of baptism, but also faith and conversion of heart, if recourse may not be had to the celebration of the mystery of baptism for want of time.[fn-36-P3609_2022061:129-nf] For neither was that thief crucified for the name of Christ, but as the reward of his own deeds; nor did he suffer because he believed, but he believed while suffering.

For much more in the case of Cornelius and his friends, than in the case of that robber, might it seem superfluous that they should also be baptized with water, seeing that in them the gift of the Holy Spirit, which, according to the testimony of holy Scripture, was received by other men only after baptism, had made itself manifest by every unmistakable sign apppropriate to those times when they spoke with tongues. Yet they were baptized, and for this action we have the authority of an apostle as the warrant. So far ought all of us to be from being induced by any imperfection in the inner man, if it so happen that before baptism a person has advanced, through the workings of a pious heart, to spiritual understanding, to despise a sacrament which is applied to the body by the hands of the minister, but which is God's own means for working spiritually a man's dedication to Himself. Nor do I conceive that the function of baptizing was assigned to John, so that it should be called John's baptism, for any other reason except that the Lord Himself, who had appointed it, in not disdaining to receive the baptism of His servant,[fn-36-P3611_2023897:131-nf] might consecrate the path of humility, and show most plainly by such an action how high a value was to be placed on His own baptism, with which He Himself was afterwards to baptize. For He saw, like an excellent physician of eternal salvation, that overweening pride would be found in some, who, having made such progress in the understanding of the truth and in uprightness of character that they would not hesitate to place themselves, both in life and knowledge, above many that were baptized, would think it was unnecessary for them to be baptized, since they felt that they had attained a frame of mind to which many that were baptized were still only endeavoring to raise themselves.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Lord, who hath believed our report? \"[fn-57-P5717_1729700:60-nf] Isaiah says.

For to none of the prophets, to no one at all in holy Scripture, do we read that it was granted to baptize in the water of repentance for the remission of sins, as it was granted to John; that, causing the hearts of the people to hang upon him through this marvellous grace, he might prepare in them the way for Him whom he declared to be so infinitely greater than himself. But the Lord Jesus Christ cleanses His Church by such a baptism that on receiving it no other is required; while John gave a first washing with such a baptism that on receiving it there was further need of the baptism of the Lord,-not that the first baptism should be repeated, but that the baptism of Christ, for whom he was preparing the way, might be further bestowed on those who had received the baptism of John. For if Christ's humility were not to be commended to our notice, neither would there be any need of the baptism of John; again, if the end were in John, after his baptism there would be no need of the baptism of Christ.

The same, John, therefore, set forth both the exalted nature of the Lord, when he placed Him far before himself, and His humility, when he baptized Him as the lowest of the people. But if John had baptized Christ alone, he would be thought to have been the dispenser of a better baptism, in that with which Christ alone was baptized, than the baptism of Christ with which Christians are baptized; and again, if all ought to be baptized first with the baptism of John, and then with that of Christ, the baptism of Christ would deservedly seem to be lacking in fullness and perfection, as not sufficing for salvation. Wherefore the Lord was baptized with the baptism of John, that He might bend the proud necks of men to His own health-giving baptism; and He was not alone baptized with it, lest He should show His own to be inferior to this, with which none but He Himself had deserved to be baptized; and He did not allow it to continue longer, lest the one baptism with which He baptizes might seem to need the other to precede it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-01","text":"1.

The confession that is made with the voice, and before the authorities, is what the most reckon the only confession. Not soundly: and hypocrites also can confess with this confession. But neither will this utterance be found to be spoken universally; for all the saved have confessed with the confession made by the voice, and departed.[fn-68-P6823_2078370:106-nf] Of whom are Matthew, Philip, Thomas, Levi, and many others. And confession by the lip is not universal, but partial. But that which He specifies now is universal, that which is by deeds and actions corresponding to faith in Him. This confession is followed by that which is partial, that before the authorities, if necessary, and reason dictate. For he will confess rightly with his voice who has first confessed by his disposition.[fn-68-P6824_2079084:107-nf] And he has well used, with regard to those who confess, the expression `in Me, 'and applied to those who deny the expression`Me.'For those, though they confess Him with the voice, yet deny Him, not confessing Him in their conduct. But those alone confess `in Him, 'who live in the confession and conduct according to Him, in which He also confesses, who is contained in them and held by them. Wherefore `He never can deny Himself.'And those deny Him who are not in Him. For He said not, `Whosoever shall deny'in Me, but `Me.'For no one who is in Him will ever deny Him. And the expression `before men' applies both to the saved and the heathen similarly by conduct before the one, and by voice before the other. Wherefore they never can deny Him. But those deny Him who are not in Him.\" So far Heracleon. And in other things he seems to be of the same sentiments with us in this section; but he has not adverted to this, that if some have not by conduct and in their life \"confessed Christ before men,\" they are manifested to have believed with the heart; by confessing Him with the mouth at the tribunals, and not denying Him when tortured to the death. And the disposition being confessed, and especially not being changed by death at any time, cuts away all passions which were engendered by corporeal desire. For there is, so to speak, at the close of life a sudden repentance in action, and a true confession toward Christ, in the testimony of the voice. But if the Spirit of the Father testifies in us, how can we be any more hypocrites, who are said to bear testimony with the voice alone? But it will be given to some, if expedient, to make a defence, that by their witness and confession all may be benefited-those in the Church being confirmed, and those of the heathen who have devoted themselves to the search after salvation wondering and being led to the faith; and the rest seized with amazement. So that confession is by all means necessary.[fn-68-P6825_2081323:108-nf] For it is in our power. But to make a defence for our faith is not universally necessary. For that does not depend on us. \"But he that endureth to the end shall be saved.\" For who of those who are wise would not choose to reign in God, and even to serve? So some \"confess that they know God,\" according to the apostle; \"but in works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.\"[fn-68-P6826_2081879:109-nf] And these, though they confess nothing but this, will have done at the end one good work. Their witness, then, appears to be the cleansing away of sins with glory. For instance, the Shepherd[fn-68-P6827_2082089:110-nf] says: \"You will escape the energy of the wild beast, if your heart become pure and blameless.\" Also the Lord Himself says: \"Satan hath desired to sift you; but I have prayed.\"[fn-68-P6828_2082298:111-nf] Alone, therefore, the Lord, for the purification of the men who plotted against Him and disbelieved Him, \"drank the cup; \"in imitation of whom the apostles, that they might be in reality Gnostics, and perfect, suffered for the Churches which they founded. So, then, also the Gnostics who tread in the footsteps of the apostles ought to be sinless, and, out of love to the Lord, to love also their brother; so that, if occasion call, enduring without stumbling, afflictions for the Church, \"they may drink the cup.\" Those who witness in their life by deed, and at the tribunal by word, whether entertaining hope or surmising fear, are better than those who confess salvation by their mouth alone. But if one ascend also to love, he is a really blessed and true martyr, having confessed perfectly both to the commandments and to God, by the Lord; whom having loved, he acknowledged a brother, giving himself up wholly for God, resigning pleasantly and lovingly the man when asked, like a deposit.[fn-68-P6829_2083319:112-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":10,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"ANF-02","text":"On martyrdom the Lord hath spoken explicitly, and what is written in different places we bring together. \"But I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess in Me before men, the Son of man also shall confess before the angels of God; but whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I deny before the angels.\"[fn-68-P6820_2077266:103-nf] \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me or of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of man also be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of His Father with His angels. Whosoever therefore shall confess in Me before men, him will I also confess before my Father in heaven.[fn-68-P6821_2077585:104-nf] \"And when they bring you before synagogues, and rulers, and powers, think not: beforehand how ye shall make your defence, or what ye shall say. For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye must say.\"[fn-68-P6822_2077821:105-nf] In explanation of this passage, Heracleon, the most distinguished of the school of Valentinians, says expressly, \"that there is a confession by faith and conduct, and one with the voice. The confession that is made with the voice, and before the authorities, is what the most reckon the only confession. Not soundly: and hypocrites also can confess with this confession. But neither will this utterance be found to be spoken universally; for all the saved have confessed with the confession made by the voice, and departed.[fn-68-P6823_2078370:106-nf] Of whom are Matthew, Philip, Thomas, Levi, and many others. And confession by the lip is not universal, but partial. But that which He specifies now is universal, that which is by deeds and actions corresponding to faith in Him. This confession is followed by that which is partial, that before the authorities, if necessary, and reason dictate. For he will confess rightly with his voice who has first confessed by his disposition.[fn-68-P6824_2079084:107-nf] And he has well used, with regard to those who confess, the expression `in Me, 'and applied to those who deny the expression`Me.'For those, though they confess Him with the voice, yet deny Him, not confessing Him in their conduct. But those alone confess `in Him, 'who live in the confession and conduct according to Him, in which He also confesses, who is contained in them and held by them. Wherefore `He never can deny Himself.'And those deny Him who are not in Him. For He said not, `Whosoever shall deny'in Me, but `Me.'For no one who is in Him will ever deny Him. And the expression `before men' applies both to the saved and the heathen similarly by conduct before the one, and by voice before the other. Wherefore they never can deny Him. But those deny Him who are not in Him.\" So far Heracleon. And in other things he seems to be of the same sentiments with us in this section; but he has not adverted to this, that if some have not by conduct and in their life \"confessed Christ before men,\" they are manifested to have believed with the heart; by confessing Him with the mouth at the tribunals, and not denying Him when tortured to the death. And the disposition being confessed, and especially not being changed by death at any time, cuts away all passions which were engendered by corporeal desire. For there is, so to speak, at the close of life a sudden repentance in action, and a true confession toward Christ, in the testimony of the voice. But if the Spirit of the Father testifies in us, how can we be any more hypocrites, who are said to bear testimony with the voice alone? But it will be given to some, if expedient, to make a defence, that by their witness and confession all may be benefited-those in the Church being confirmed, and those of the heathen who have devoted themselves to the search after salvation wondering and being led to the faith; and the rest seized with amazement. So that confession is by all means necessary.[fn-68-P6825_2081323:108-nf] For it is in our power. But to make a defence for our faith is not universally necessary. For that does not depend on us. \"But he that endureth to the end shall be saved.\" For who of those who are wise would not choose to reign in God, and even to serve? So some \"confess that they know God,\" according to the apostle; \"but in works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.\"[fn-68-P6826_2081879:109-nf] And these, though they confess nothing but this, will have done at the end one good work.

Wherefore the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed; that is, the word of faith which we preach: for if thou confess the word with thy mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in thy heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-68-P6880_2108209:139-nf] There is clearly described the perfect righteousness, fulfilled both in practice and contemplation. Wherefore we are \"to bless those who persecute us. Bless, and curse not.\"[fn-68-P6881_2108412:140-nf] \"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of a good conscience, that in holiness and sincerity we know God\" by this inconsiderable instance exhibiting the work of love, that \"not in fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world.\"[fn-68-P6882_2108700:141-nf] So far the apostle respecting knowledge; and in the second Epistle to the Corinthians he calls the common \"teaching of faith\" the savour of knowledge. \"For unto this day the same veil remains on many in the reading of the Old Testament,\"[fn-68-P6883_2108959:142-nf] not being uncovered by turning to the Lord. Wherefore also to those capable of perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh, creeping on its belly. Whence also he applied the name \"brood of vipers\" to the voluptuous, who serve the belly and the pudenda, and cut off one another's heads for the sake of worldly pleasures. \"Little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue,\" says John, teaching them to be perfect, \"but in deed and in truth; hereby shall we know that we are of the truth.\"[fn-68-P6884_2109502:143-nf] And if \"God be love,\" piety also is love: \"there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-68-P6885_2109634:144-nf] \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\"[fn-68-P6886_2109718:145-nf] And again, to him who desires to become a Gnostic, it is written, \"But be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in faith, in purity.\"[fn-68-P6887_2109903:146-nf] For perfection in faith differs, I think, from ordinary faith. And the divine apostle furnishes the rule for the Gnostic in these words, writing as follows: \"For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. I can do all things through Him who strengtheneth me.\"[fn-68-P6888_2110362:147-nf] And also when discussing with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not shrink from saying, \"But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of God, ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: and if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\"[fn-68-P6889_2111342:148-nf] He then brings forward a swarm of divine examples. For was it not \"by faith,\" he says, this endurance, that they acted nobly who \"had trial of mockeries and scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were stoned, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through faith, received not the promise of God\" (what is expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., \"alone \"). He adds accordingly, \"God having provided some better thing for us (for He was good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore also, having encompassing us such a cloud,\" holy and transparent, \"of witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.\"[fn-68-P6890_2112408:149-nf] Since, then, he specifies one salvation in Christ of the righteous,[fn-68-P6891_2112510:150-nf] and of us he has expressed the former unambiguously, and saying nothing less respecting Moses, adds, \"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\"[fn-68-P6892_2112908:151-nf] The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, \"They seemed in the eyes of the foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and their migration from us an affliction. But they are in peace. For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of immortality.\"[fn-68-P6893_2113261:152-nf] He then adds, teaching martyrdom to be a glorious purification, \"And being chastened a little, they shall be benefited much; because God proved them,\" that is, suffered them to be tried, to put them to the proof, and to put to shame the author of their trial, \"and found them worthy of Himself,\" plainly to be called sons. \"As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as a whole burned-offering of sacrifice He accepted them. And in the time of their visitation they will shine forth, even as sparks run along the stubble. They shall judge the nations, and rule over the peoples, and the Lord shall reign over them forever.\"[fn-68-P6894_2113912:153-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":10,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"214","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Here I find perfection apprehended variously in relation to Him who excels in every virtue.

By the grace of God, by the Holy Spirit. For we could not have it from ourselves, as if making it for ourselves. It is the gift of God, and a great gift it is: for, saith he, \"the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given to us.\"[fn-9-P941_527504:8-nf] Wherefore love completes the law, and most truly it is said, \"Love is the perfecting of the law.\" Let us inquire as to thislove, in what manner the Lord doth commend it to our consideration. Remember what I laid down: I want to explain the number thirty-eight of the years of that impotent man, why that number thirty-eight is one of weakness rather than of health. Now, as I was saying, love fulfills the law. The number forty belongs to the perfecting of the law in all works; but in love two precepts are committed to our keeping. Keep before your eyes, I beseech you, and fix in your memory, what I say; be ye not despisers of the word, that your soul may not become a trodden path, where the seed cast cannot sprout, \"and the fowls of the air will come and gather it up.\" Apprehend it, and lay it up in your hearts. The precepts of love, given to us by the Lord, are two: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;\" and, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-9-P942_528605:9-nf] With good reason did the widow cast \"two mites,\" all her substance, into the offerings of God: with good reason did the host take \"two\" pieces of money, for the poor man that was wounded by the robbers, for his making whole: with good reason did Jesus spent two days with the Samaritans, to establish them in love. Thus, whilst a certain good thing is generally signified by this number two, most especially is love in its twofold character set forth to us thereby. If, therefore, the number forty possesses the perfecting of the law, and the law is fulfilled only in the twin precepts of love, why dost thou wonder that he was weak and sick, who was short of forty by two?","title":"Tractate XVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_63_xiii_the_third_conference_of_abbot_chaeremon_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"For we should not hold that God made man such that he can never will or be capable of what is good: or else He has not granted him a free will, if He has suffered him only to will or be capable of evil, but neither to will or be capable of what is good of himself. And, in this case how will that first statement of the Lord made about men after the fall stand: \"Behold, Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil?\"[fn-53-P5348_1915089:59-nf] For we cannot think that before, he was such as to be altogether ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to admit that he was formed like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest Solomon says: \"God made man upright,\" i.e., always to enjoy the knowledge of good only, \"But they have sought out many imaginations,\"[fn-53-P5349_1915518:60-nf] for they came, as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam therefore after the fall conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did not lose the knowledge of good which he had before. Finally the Apostle's words very clearly show that mankind did not lose after the fall of Adam the knowledge of good: as he says: \"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have not the law, are a law to themselves, as they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to these, and their thoughts within them either accusing or else excusing them, in the day in which God shall judge the secrets of men.\"[fn-53-P5350_1916254:61-nf] And with the same meaning the Lord rebukes by the prophet the unnatural but freely chosen blindness of the Jews, which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves, saying: \"Hear ye deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. Who is deaf but My servant? and blind, but he to whom I have sent My messengers?\"[fn-53-P5351_1916588:62-nf] And that no one might ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature instead of to their own will, elsewhere He says: \"Bring forth the people that are blind and have eyes: that are deaf and have ears;\" and again: \"having eyes, but ye see not; and ears, but ye hear not.\"[fn-53-P5352_1916878:63-nf] The Lord also says in the gospel: \"Because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not neither do they understand.\"[fn-53-P5353_1917028:64-nf] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: \"Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing: and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and be turned and I should heal them.\"[fn-53-P5354_1917450:65-nf] Finally in order to denote that the possibility of good was in them, in chiding the Pharisees, He says: \"But why of your own selves do ye not judge what is right?\"[fn-53-P5355_1917634:66-nf] And this he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that by their natural judgment they could discern what was fair. Wherefore we must take care not to refer all the merits of the saints to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to human nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the most wise Solomon, or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these are; for when the building of the Temple was finished and he was praying, he spoke as follows: \"And David my father would have built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David my father: Whereas thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to My name, thou hast well done in having this same thing in thy mind. Nevertheless thou shall not build a house to My name.\"[fn-53-P5356_1918476:67-nf] This thought then and this purpose of king David, are we to call it good and from God or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from God, why did He by whom it was inspired refuse that it should be carried into effect? But if it is bad and from man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains then that we must take it as good and from man. And in the same way we can take our own thoughts today. For it was not given only to David to think what is good of himself, nor is it denied to us naturally to think or imagine anything that is good. It cannot then be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of goodness in every soul implanted by the kindness of the Creator: but unless these are quickened by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain to an increase of perfection, for, as the blessed Apostle says: \"Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.\"[fn-53-P5357_1919433:68-nf] But that freedom of the will is to some degree in a man's own power is very clearly taught in the book termed the Pastor,[fn-53-P5358_1919575:69-nf] where two angels are said to be attached to each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad one, while it lies at a man's own option to choose which to follow. And therefore the will always remains free in man, and can either neglect or delight in the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded saying: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" had he not known that it could be advanced or neglected by us. But that men might not fancy that they had no need of Divine aid for the work of Salvation, he subjoins: \"For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure.\"[fn-53-P5359_1920216:70-nf] And therefore he warns Timothy and says: \"Neglect not the grace of God which is in thee;\" and again: \"For which cause I exhort thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee.\"[fn-53-P5360_1920418:71-nf] Hence also in writing to the Corinthians he exhorts and warns them not through their unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy of the grace of God, saying: \"And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:\"[fn-53-P5361_1920685:72-nf] for the reception of saving grace was of no profit to Simon doubtless because he had received it in vain; for he would not obey the command of the blessed Peter who said: \"Repent of thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity.\"[fn-53-P5362_1921057:73-nf] It prevents therefore the will of man, for it is said: \"My God will prevent me with His mercy;\"[fn-53-P5363_1921177:74-nf] and again when God waits and for our good delays, that He may put our desires to the test, our will precedes, for it is said: \"And in the morning my prayer shall prevent Thee;\" and again: \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and: \"Mine eyes have prevented the morning.\"[fn-53-P5364_1921485:75-nf] For He calls and invites us, when He says: \"All the day long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;\"[fn-53-P5365_1921674:76-nf] and He is invited by us when we say to Him: \"All the day long I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee\"[fn-53-P5366_1921796:77-nf] He waits for us, when it is said by the prophet: \"Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have compassion upon us;\"[fn-53-P5367_1921937:78-nf] and He is waited for by us, when we say: \"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me;\" and: \"I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.\"[fn-53-P5368_1922104:79-nf] He strengthens us when He says: \"And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and they have imagined evil against me;\"[fn-53-P5369_1922280:80-nf] and He exhorts us to strengthen ourselves when He says: \"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make strong the feeble knees.\"[fn-53-P5370_1922422:81-nf] Jesus cries: \"If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink;\"[fn-53-P5371_1922504:82-nf] the prophet also cries to Him: \"I have laboured with crying, my jaws are become hoarse: mine eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.\"[fn-53-P5372_1922663:83-nf] The Lord seeks us, when He says: \"I sought and there was no man.

Let Him declare this more distinctly, that the heretical denier of the resurrection of the body may not find a pretext for sophistical cavil, although the meaning already shines out clearly.

Bodies are in the graves; souls are not in the graves, either of just or of unjust. The soul of the just man was in the bosom of Abraham; the unjust man's soul was in hell, tormented: neither the one nor the other was in the grave. Above, when He saith, \"The hour is coming, and now is,\" I beseech you give earnest heed.

The apostle says openly, \"But not all obey the gospel.\"[fn-10-P1025_612764:14-nf] But they that hear shall live, because all that obey the gospel shall pass to eternal life by faith: yet all do not obey; and this is now. But certainly, in the end, \"All that are in the graves,\" both the just and the unjust, \"shall hear His voice, and come forth.\" How is it He would not say, \"and shall live\"? All, indeed, will come forth, but all will not live. For in that which He said above, \"And they that hear shall live,\" He meant it to be understood that there is in that very hearing and obeying an eternal and blessed life, which not all that shall come forth from the graves will have.

To what purpose dost thou make ready teeth and stomach? Believe, and thou hast eaten already. Faith is indeed distinguished from works, even as the apostle says, \"that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law:\"[fn-12-P1240_780373:13-nf] there are works which appear good, without faith in Christ; but they are not good, because they are not referred to that end in which works are good; \"for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-12-P1241_780624:14-nf] For that reason, He willeth not to distinguish faith from work, but declared faith itself to be work. For it is that same faith that worketh by love.[fn-12-P1242_780790:15-nf] Nor did He say, This is your work; but, \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He has sent;\" so that he who glories, may glory in the Lord. And because He invited them to faith, they, on the other hand, were still asking for signs by which they might believe. See if the Jews do not ask for signs. \"They said therefore rate Him, What sign doest thou, that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?\" Was it a trifle that they were fed with five loaves? They knew this indeed, but they preferred manna from heaven to this food. But the Lord Jesus declared Himself to be such an one, that He was superior to Moses. For Moses dared not say of Himself that He gave, \"not the meat which perisheth, but that which endureth to eternal life.\" Jesus promised something greater than Moses gave. By Moses indeed was promised a kingdom, and a land flowing with milk and honey, temporal peace, abundance of children, health of body, and all other things, temporal goods indeed, yet in figure spiritual; because in the Old Testament they were promised to the old man. They considered therefore the things promised by Moses, and they considered the things promised by Christ. The former promised a full belly on the earth, but of the meat which perisheth; the latter promised, \"not the meat which perisheth, but that which endureth unto eternal life.\" They gave attention to Him that promised the more, but just as if they did not yet see Him do greater things. They considered therefore what sort of works Moses had done, and they wished yet some greater works to be done by Him who promised them such great things. What, say they, doest thou, that we may believe thee?

Perhaps ye despise it. \"As it is written, He gave them manna to eat.\" By Moses our fathers received bread from heaven, and Moses did not say to them, \"Labor for the meat which perisheth not.\" Thou promisest \"meat which perisheth not, but which endureth to eternal life;\" and yet thou workest not such works as Moses did. He gave, not barley loaves, but manna from heaven.","title":"Tractate XXV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_31_tractate_xxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. When our Lord Jesus Christ, as we have heard in the Gospel when it was read, had said that He was Himself the bread which came down from heaven, the Jews murmured and said, \"Is not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?\" These Jews were far off from the bread of heaven, and knew not how to hunger after it. They had the jaws of their heart languid; with open ears they were deaf, they saw and stood blind. This bread, indeed, requires the hunger of the inner man: and hence He saith in another place, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.\"[fn-12-P1263_797648:1-nf] But the Apostle Paul says that Christ is for us righteousness.[fn-12-P1264_797726:2-nf] And, consequently, he that hungers after this bread, hungers after righteousness,-that righteousness however which cometh down from heaven, the righteousness that God gives, not that which man works for himself. For if man were not making a righteousness for himself, the same apostle would not have said of the Jews: \"For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, they are not subject to the righteousness of God.\"[fn-12-P1265_798212:3-nf] Of such were these who understood not the bread that cometh down from heaven; because being satisfied with their own righteousness, they hungered not after the righteousness of God. What is this, God's righteousness and man's righteousness? God's righteousness here means, not that wherein God is righteous, but that which God bestows on man, that man may be righteous through God. But again, what was the righteousness of those Jews? A righteousness wrought of their own strength on which they presumed, and so declared themselves as if they were fulfillers of the law by their own virtue. But no man fulfills the law but he whom grace assists, that is, whom the bread that cometh down from heaven assists. \"For the fulfilling of the law,\" as the apostle says in brief, \"is charity.\"[fn-12-P1266_799011:4-nf] Charity, that is, love, not of money, but of God; love, not of earth nor of heaven, but of Him who made Heaven and earth. Whence can man have that love? Let us hear the same: \"The love of God,\" saith he, \"is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.\"[fn-12-P1267_799307:5-nf] Wherefore, the Lord, about to give the Holy Spirit, said that Himself was the bread that came down from heaven, exhorting us to believe on Him. For to believe on Him is to eat the living bread. He that believes eats; he is sated invisibly, because invisibly is he born again. A babe within, a new man within. Where he is made new, there he is satisfied with food.","title":"Tractate XXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_31_tractate_xxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. What then did the Lord answer to such murmurers? \"Murmur not among yourselves.\" As if He said, I know why ye are not hungry, and do not understand nor seek after this bread. \"Murmur not among yourselves: no man can come unto me, except the Father that sent me draw him.\" Noble excellence of grace! No man comes unless drawn. There is whom He draws, and there is whom He draws not; why He draws one and draws not another, do not desire to judge, if thou desirest not to err. Accept it at once and then understand; thou art not yet drawn? Pray that thou mayest be drawn. What do we say here, brethren? If we are \"drawn\" to Christ, it follows that we believe against our will; so then is force applied, not the will moved. A man can come to Church unwillingly, can approach the altar unwillingly, partake of the sacrament unwillingly: but he cannot believe unless he is willing. If we believed with the body, men might be made to believe against their will. But believing is not a thing done with the body. Hear the apostle: \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness.\" And what follows? \"And with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\"[fn-12-P1269_800834:6-nf] That confession springs from the root of the heart. Sometimes thou hearest a man confessing, and knowest not whether he believes. But thou oughtest not to call him one confessing, if thou shouldest judge him to be one not believing. For to confess is this, to utter the thing that thou hast in thy heart: if thou hast one thing in thy heart, and another thing on thy tongue, thou art speaking, not confessing. Since, then, with the heart man believeth on Christ, which no man assuredly does against his will, and since he that is drawn seems to be as if forced against his will, how are we to solve this question, \"No man cometh unto me, except the Father that sent me draw him\"?.","title":"Tractate XXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_164_melito_the_philosopher_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-08","text":"\"But, notwithstanding this, I say that so long as a man does not hear, and so does not discern or understand that there is a Lord over these creatures, he is not perhaps to be blamed: because no one finds fault with a blind man though he walk ever so badly.

All things that were spoken to the ancient people Israel in the manifold Scripture of the holy law, what things they did, whether in sacrifices, or in priestly offices, or in feast-days, and, in a word, in what things soever they worshipped God, what things soever were spoken to and given them in precept, were shadows of things to come. Of what things to come? Things which find their fulfillment in Christ. Whence the apostle says, \"For all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-13-P1366_864491:17-nf] that is, they are fulfilled in Him. Again he says in another place, \"All happened to them in a figure; but they were written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages is come.\"[fn-13-P1367_864690:18-nf] And he said elsewhere, \"For Christ is the end of the law;\"[fn-13-P1368_864767:19-nf] likewise in another place, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of a new moon, or of Sabbath-days, which is a shadow of things to come.\"[fn-13-P1369_864960:20-nf] If, therefore, all these things were shadows of things to come, also the feast of tabernacles was a shadow of things to come. Let us examine, then, of what thing to come was this feast-day a shadow. I have explained what this feast of tabernacles was: it was a celebration of tabernacles, because the people, after their deliverance from Egypt, while directing their course through the wilderness to the land of promise, dwelt in tents. Let us observe what it is, and we shall be that thing; we, I say, who are members of Christ, if such we are; but we are, He having made us worthy, not we having earned it for ourselves. Let us then consider ourselves, brethren: we have been led out of Egypt, where we were slaves to the devil as to Pharaoh; where we applied ourselves to works of clay, engaged in earthly desires, and where we toiled exceedingly. And to us, while laboring, as it were, at the bricks, Christ cried aloud, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.\" Thence we were led out by baptism as through the Red Sea.-red because consecrated by the blood of Christ. All our enemies that pursued us being dead, that is, all our sins being blotted out, we have been brought over to the other side. At the present time, then, before we come to the land of promise, namely, the eternal kingdom, we are in the wilderness in tabernacles. They who acknowledge these things are in tabernacles; for it was to be that some would acknowledge this. For that man, who understands that he is a sojourner in this world, is in tabernacles. That man understands that he is travelling in a foreign country, when he sees himself sighing for his native land. But whilst the body of Christ is in tabernacles, Christ is in tabernacles; but at that time He was so, not evidently but secretly. For as yet the shadow obscured the light; when the light came, the shadow was removed. Christ was in secret: He was in the feast of tabernacles, but there hidden. At the present time, when these things are already made manifest, we acknowledge that we are journeying in the wilderness: for if we know it, we are in the wilderness. What is it to be in the wilderness? In the desert waste. Why in the desert waste? Because in this world, where we thirst in a way in which is no water. But yet, let us thirst that we may be filled. For, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-13-P1370_867398:21-nf] And our thirst is quenched from the rock in the wilderness: for \"the Rock was Christ,\" and it was smitten with a rod that the water might flow. But that it might flow, the rock was smitten twice: because there are two beams of the cross.[fn-13-P1371_867653:22-nf] All these things, then, which were done in a figure, are made manifest to us. And it is not without meaning that it was said of the Lord, \"He went up to the feast-day. but not openly, but as it were in secret.\" For Himself in secret was the thing prefigured, because Christ was hid in that same festal-day; for that very festal-day signified Christ's members that were to sojourn in a foreign land.","title":"Tractate XXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_81_homily_lxxv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"After this again, what is more grievous than all, they shall not have so much as the consolation from love.

Is He not the same of whom we confess that He rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven, there sits at the right hand of the Father, and thence shall come to judge the quick and the dead? Is not this our faith of which the apostle says, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation?\"[fn-15-P1580_995595:2-nf] When, therefore, we confess these things, do we contradict the Lord? We say that He shall come a judge of the quick and the dead, whilst He says Himself, \"I judge not any man.\" This question maybe solved in two ways: Either that we may understand this expression, \"I judge not any man,\" to mean, I judge not any man now; in accordance with what He says in another place, \"I am not come to judge the world, But to save the world;\" not denying His judgment here, but deferring it. Or, otherwise, surely that when He said, \"Ye judge after the flesh,\" He subjoined, \"I judge not any man,\" in such manner that thou shouldst understand \"after the flesh\" to complete the sense. Therefore let no scruple of doubt remain in our heart against the faith which we hold and declare concerning Christ as judge. Christ is come, but first to save, then to judge: to adjudge to punishment those who would not be saved; to bring them to life who, by believing, did not reject salvation. Accordingly, the first dispensation of our Lord Jesus Christ is medicinal, not judicial; for if He had come to judge first, He would have found none on whom He might bestow the rewards of righteousness. Because, therefore, He saw that all were sinners, and that none was exempt from the death of sin, His mercy had first to be craved, and afterwards His judgmentmust be executed; for of Him the psalm had sung, \"Mercy and judgment will I sin to Thee, O Lord.\"[fn-15-P1581_997039:3-nf] Now, He says not judgment and mercy,\" for if judgment had been first, there would be no mercy; but it is mercy first, then judgment. What is the mercy first? The Creator of man deigned to become man; was made what He had made, that the creature He had made might not perish. What can be added to this mercy? And yet He has added thereto. It was not enough for Him to be made man, He added to this that He was rejected of men; it was not enough to be rejected, He was dishonored; it was not enough to be dishonored, He was put to death; but even this was not enough, it was by the death of the cross. For when the apostle was commending to us His obedience even unto death, it was not enough for him to say, \"He became obedient unto death;\" for it was not unto death of any kind whatever: but he added, \"even the death of the cross.\"[fn-15-P1582_997886:4-nf] Among all kinds of death, there was nothing worse than that death. In short, that wherein one is racked by the most intense pains is called cruciatus, which takes its name from crux, a cross. For the crucified, hanging on the tree, nailed to the wood, were killed by a slow lingering death. To be crucified was not merely to be put to death; for the victim lived long on the cross, not because longer life was chosen, but because death itself was stretched out that the pain might not be too quickly ended. He willed to die for us, yet it is not enough to say this; He deigned to be crucified, became obedient even to the death of the cross. He who was about to take away all death, chose the lowest and worst kind of death: He slew death by the worst of deaths. To the Jews who understood not, it was indeed the worst of deaths, but it was chosen by the Lord. For He was to have that very cross as His sign; that very cross, a trophy, as it were, over the vanquished devil, He was to put on the brow of believers, so that the apostle said, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.\"[fn-15-P1583_999080:5-nf] Nothing was then more intolerable in the flesh, nothing is now more glorious on the brow. What does He reserve for His faithful one, when He has put such honor on the instrument of His own torture? Now is the cross no longer used among the Romans in the punishment of criminals, for where the cross of the Lord came to be honored, it was thought that even a guilty man would be honored if he should be crucified. Hence, He who came for this cause judged no man: He suffered also the wicked. He suffered unjust judgment, that He might execute righteous judgment. But it was of His mercy that He endured unjust judgment. In short, He became so low as to come to the cross; yea, laid aside His power, but published His mercy. Wherein did He lay aside His power? In that He would not come down from the cross, though He had the power to rise again from the sepulchre. Wherein did He publish His mercy? In that, when hanging on the cross, He said, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\"[fn-15-P1584_1000096:6-nf] Whether, then, it be that He said, \"I judge not any man,\" because He had come not to judge the world, out to save the world; or, that, as I have mentioned, when He had said, \"Ye judge after the flesh,\" He added, \"I judge not any man,\" for us to understand that Christ judgeth not after the flesh, like as He was judged by men.","title":"Tractate XXXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_82_sermon_lxv_cxv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

But it becomes us rather to inquire what is to be understood by this serving of Christ to which there is attached so great a reward. For if we have taken up the idea that the serving of Christ is the preparation of what is needful for the body, or the cooking and serving up of food, or the mixing of drink and handing the cup to one at the supper table; this, indeed, was done to Him by those who had the privilege of His bodily presence, as in the case of Martha and Mary, when Lazarus also was one of those who sat at the table. But in that sort of way Christ was served also by the reprobate Judas; for it was he also who had the money bag; and although he had the exceeding wickedness to steal of its contents, yet it was he also who provided what was needful for the meal.[fn-22-P2245_1377494:16-nf] And so also, when our Lord said to him, \"What thou doest, do quickly,\" there were some who thought that He only gave him orders to make some needful preparations for the feast-day, or to give something to the poor.[fn-22-P2246_1378033:17-nf] In no sense, therefore, was it of this class of servants that the Lord said, \"Where I am, there shall also my servant be,\" and \"If any man serve me, him will my Father honor;\" for we see that Judas, who served in this way, became an object of reprobation rather than of honor. Why, then, go elsewhere to find out what this serving of Christ implies, and not rather see its disclosure in the words themselves? for when He said, \"If any man serve me, let him follow me,\" He wished it to be understood just as if He had said, If any man doth not follow me, he serveth me not. And those, therefore, are the servants of Jesus Christ, who seek not their own things, but the things that are Jesus Christ's.[fn-22-P2247_1378759:18-nf] For \"let him follow me\" is just this: Let him walk in my ways, and not in his own; as it is written elsewhere, \"He that saith he abideth in Christ, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\"[fn-22-P2248_1378978:19-nf] For he ought, if supplying food to the hungry, to do it in the way of mercy and not of boasting, seeking therein nothing else but the doing of good, and not letting his left hand know what his right hand doeth;[fn-22-P2249_1379209:20-nf] in other words, that all thought of self-seeking should be utterly estranged from a work of charity. He that serveth in this way serveth Christ, and will have it rightly said to him, \"Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of those who are mine, ye did it unto me.\"[fn-22-P2250_1379498:21-nf] And thus doing not only those acts of mercy that pertain to the body, but every good work, for the sake of Christ (for then will all be good, because \"Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth \"[fn-22-P2251_1379747:22-nf] ), he is Christ's servant even to that work of special love, which is to lay down his life for the brethren, for that were to lay it down also for Christ.

Ye that are well instructed in the school of Christ, know that this Jacob is Israel too. They are two names; for they are one man. His first name Jacob, which is by interpretation supplanter, he received when he was born. For when those twins were born, his brother Esau was born first; and the hand of the younger was found on the elder's foot.[fn-58-P5879_2491870:13-nf] He held his brother's foot who preceded him in his birth, and himself came after And because of this occurrence, because he held his brother's heel,[fn-58-P5880_2492042:14-nf] he was called Jacob, that is, Supplanter. And afterwards, when he was returning from Mesopotamia, the Angel wrestled with him in the way.[fn-58-P5881_2492194:15-nf] What comparison can there. be between an Angel's and a man's strength? Therefore it is a mystery, a sacrament, a prophecy, a figure; let us therefore understand it. For consider the manner of the struggle too. While he wrestleth, Jacob prevailed against the Angel. Some high meaning is here. And when the man had prevailed against the Angel, he kept hold of Him; yes, the man kept hold of Him whom he had conquered. And said to Him, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\"[fn-58-P5882_2492696:16-nf] When the conqueror was blessed by the Conquered, Christ was figured. So then that Angel, who is understood to be the Lord Jesus, saith to Jacob, \"Thou shall not be any more called Jacob, but Israel shall thy name be,\"[fn-58-P5883_2492935:17-nf] which is by interpretation,\" Seeing God.\" After this He touched the sinew of his thigh, the broad part, that is, of the thigh, and it dried up; and Jacob became lame. Such was He who was conquered. So great power had this Conquered One, as to touch the thigh, and make lame. It was then with His Own will that He was conquered. For He \"had power to lay down\" His strength, \"and He had power to take It up.\"[fn-58-P5884_2493362:18-nf] He is not angry at being conquered, for He is not angry at being crucified. For He even blessed him, saying, \"Thou shall not be called Jacob, but Israel.\" Then the\" supplanter\" was made \"the seer of God.\" And He touched, as I have said, his thigh, and made him lame. Observe in Jacob the people of the Jews, those thousands who followed and went before the Lord's beast, who in concert with the Apostles worshipped the Lord, and cried out, \"Hosanna to the Son of David, Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5885_2493901:19-nf] Behold Jacob blessed. He has continued lame until now in them who are at this day Jews. For the broad part of the thigh signifies the multitude ofincrease. Of whom the Psalm, when it prophesied that the Nations should believe, speaketh, saying, \"A people whom I have not known, hath served Me; by the hearing of the ear it hath obeyed Me.\"[fn-58-P5886_2494260:20-nf] I was not there, and I was heard; here I was, and I was killed. \"A people whom I have not known, hath served Me; by the hearing of the ear it hath obeyed Me.\" Therefore, \"faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.\"[fn-58-P5887_2494555:21-nf] And it goes on, \"The strange children have lied unto Me;\" concerning the Jews. \"The strange children have lied unto Me, the strange children have faded away and have halted from their paths.\" I have pointed out Jacob to you, Jacob blessed and Jacob lame.","title":"Sermon LXXII.

I know, indeed, that Thou didst empty Thyself; but in taking the form of a servant,[fn-26-P2675_1566313:5-nf] it was neither that Thou didst lay down the form of God as something to return to, or that Thou lost it as something to be recovered; and yet Thou didst come, and didst place Thyself not only before the carnal eyes, but even in the very hands of men. And how otherwise save in Thy flesh? By means of this Thou didst come, yet abiding where Thou wast; by this means Thou didst return, without leaving the place to which Thou hadst come. If, then, by such means Thou didst come and return, by such means doubtless Thou art not only the way for us to come unto Thee, but wast the way also for Thyself to come and to return. For when Thou didst return to the life, which Thou art Thyself, then of a truth that same flesh of Thine Thou didst bring from death unto life. The Word of God, indeed, is one thing, and man another; but the Word was made flesh, or became man. And so the person of the Word is not different from that of the man, seeing that Christ is both in one person; and in this way, just as when His flesh died. Christ died, and when His flesh was buried, Christ was buried (for thus with the heart we believe unto righteousness, and thus with the mouth do we make confession unto salvation[fn-26-P2676_1567530:6-nf] ); so when the flesh came from death unto life, Christ came to life. And because Christ is the Word of God, He is also the life. And thus in a wonderful and ineffable manner He, who never laid down or lost Himself, came to Himself. But God, as was said, had come through the flesh to men, the truth to liars; for God is true, and every man a liar.[fn-26-P2677_1567893:7-nf] When, therefore, He withdrew His flesh from amongst men, and carried it up there where no liar is found, He also Himself-for the Word was made flesh-returned by Himself, that is, by His flesh, to the truth, which is none other but Himself. And this truth, we cannot doubt, although found amongst liars, He preserved even in death; for Christ was once dead, but never false.","title":"Tractate LXIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_204_sermon_lxiii_on_the_passion_xii_preached_on_wednesday_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"As therefore there is no believer, dearly-beloved, to whom the gifts of grace are denied, so there is no one who is not a debtor in the matter of Christian discipline; because, although the severity of the mystic Law is done away, yet the benefits of its voluntary observance have increased, as the evangelist John says, \"Because the Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ[fn-37-P3742_942134:11-nf] .\" For all things that, according to the Law, went before, whether in the circumcision of the flesh, or in the multitude of victims, or in the keeping of the Sabbath, testified of Christ, and foretold the grace of Christ.

Take away the word, and the water is neither more nor less than water. The word is added to the element, and there results the Sacrament, as if itself also a kind of visible word.

For even in the word itself the passing sound is one thing, the abiding efficacy another. \"This is the word of faith which we preach,\" says the apostle, \"that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shall be saved.
