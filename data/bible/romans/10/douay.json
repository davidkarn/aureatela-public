{"verses":["Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed and my prayer to God is\nfor them unto salvation.","For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not\naccording to knowledge.","For they, not knowing the justice of God and seeking to establish\ntheir own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God.","For the end of the law is Christ:  unto justice to everyone that\nbelieveth.","For Moses wrote that the justice which is of the law:  The man\nthat shall do it shall live by it.","But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus:  Say not in thy\nheart:  Who shall ascend into heaven?  That is to bring Christ down;","Or who shall descend into the deep?  That is, to bring up Christ\nagain from the dead.","But what saith the scripture?  The word is nigh thee; even in thy\nmouth and in thy heart.  This is the word of faith, which we preach.","For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in\nthy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be\nsaved.","For, with the heart, we believe unto justice:  but, with the\nmouth, confession is made unto salvation.","For the scripture saith:  Whosoever believeth in him shall not be\nconfounded.","For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek:  for the\nsame is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.","For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be\nsaved.","How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?\nOr how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard?  And how\nshall they hear without a preacher?","And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written:\nHow beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of\nthem that bring glad tidings of good things?","But all do not obey the gospel.  For Isaias saith:  Lord, who hath\nbelieved our report?","Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.","But I say:  Have they not heard?  Yes, verily:  Their sound hath\ngone forth into all the earth:  and their words unto the ends of the\nwhole world.","But I say:  Hath not Israel known?  First, Moses saith:  I will\nprovoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation:  by a foolish\nnation I will anger you.","But Isaias is bold, and saith:  I was found by them that did not\nseek me.  I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.","But to Israel he saith:  All the day long have I spread my hands\nto a people that believeth not and contradicteth me."]}
