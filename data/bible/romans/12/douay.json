{"verses":["I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you\npresent your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your\nreasonable service.","And be not conformed to this world:  but be reformed in the\nnewness of your mind, that you may prove what is the good and the\nacceptable and the perfect will of God.","For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among\nyou, not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise\nunto sobriety and according as God hath divided to every one the\nmeasure of faith.","For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have\nnot the same office:","So we, being many, are one body in Christ; and every one members\none of another:","And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given\nus, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;","Or ministry, in ministering; or he that teacheth, in doctrine;","He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with simplicity;\nhe that ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth mercy, with\ncheerfulness.","Let love be without dissimulation.  Hating that which is evil,\ncleaving to that which is good,","Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood:  with honour\npreventing one another.","In carefulness not slothful.  In spirit fervent.  Serving the\nLord.","Rejoicing in hope.  Patient in tribulation.  Instant in prayer.","Communicating to the necessities of the saints.  Pursuing\nhospitality.","Bless them that persecute you:  bless, and curse not.","Rejoice with them that rejoice:  weep with them that weep.","Being of one mind one towards another.  Not minding high things,\nbut consenting to the humble.  Be not wise in your own conceits.","To no man rendering evil for evil.  Providing good things, not\nonly in the sight of God but also in the sight of all men.","If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all\nmen.","Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto\nwrath, for it is written:  Revenge is mine, I will repay, saith the\nLord.","But if the enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give\nhim to drink.  For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his\nhead.","Be not overcome by evil:  but overcome evil by good."]}
