Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be brought to an end within them. We know many among ourselves who have given themselves up to bonds, in order that they might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery, that with the price[fn-5-P581_99686:243-nf] which they received for themselves, they might provide food for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman.[fn-5-P582_100261:244-nf] Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction.

In what manner, then, did He beget Him? First of all, divine operations cannot be known or declared[fn-12-P1201_532015:46-nf] by any one; but nevertheless the sacred writings teach us, in which it is laid down[fn-12-P1202_532159:47-nf] that this Son of God is the speech, or even the reason[fn-12-P1203_532231:48-nf] of God, and also that the other angels are spirits[fn-12-P1204_532344:49-nf] of God. For speech is breath sent forth with a voice signifying something. But, however, since breath and speech are sent forth from different parts, inasmuch as breath proceeds from the nostrils, speech from the mouth, the difference between the Son of God and the other angels is great. For they proceeded from God as silent spirits, because they were not created to teach[fn-12-P1205_533135:50-nf] the knowledge of God, but for His service. But though He is Himself also a spirit, yet He proceeded from the mouth of God with voice and sound, as the Word, on this account indeed, because He was about to make use of His voice to the people; that is, because He was about to be a teacher of the knowledge of God, and of the heavenly mystery[fn-12-P1206_533495:51-nf] to be revealed to man: which word also God Himself first spoke, that through Him He might speak to us, and that He might reveal to us the voice and will of God.","title":"Book IV.

And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":16,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_09_lecture_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2.

For if the servant of God ought to utter no bitterness from his mouth, but always that which is sweet and pleasant, it follows either that a priest and doctor will not be servants of God who ought to confidently rebuke sinners, and flatter no one, but boldly reprove all: or, if a priest and a doctor are not only servants of God, but have the chief place among His servants, it is idle to reserve smooth and pleasant speeches for the servants of God, for these are characteristic of heretics and of them who wish to deceive; as the Apostle says,[fn-74-P7415_2461509:75-nf] \"They that are such serve not our Lord Christ but their own belly, and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.\" Flattery is always insidious, crafty, and smooth.

Of this weakness of his, he saith in another place, \"We made ourselves small among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-45-P4574_2252429:35-nf] For in that passage the context indicates this: \"For neither at any time,\" saith he, \"used we flattering words, as ye know, nor an occasion of covetousness; God is witness: nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome to you as the Apostles of Christ: but we made ourselves small among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.\" What therefore he saith to the Corinthians, that he had power of his apostleship, as also the other Apostles, which power he testifieth that he had not used; this also he saith in that place to the Thessalonians, \"When we might have been burdensome to you as Christ's Apostles:\" according to that the Lord saith, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\" For that of this he speaks, is indicated by that which he above set down, \"Neither for occasion of coveteousness, God is witness.\" By reason, namely, of this which by right of the Lord's appointment was due to good evangelists, who not for its sake do evangelize but seek the kingdom of God, so that all these things should be added unto them, others were taking advantage thereof, of whom he also saith, \"For they that are such serve not God, but their own belly.\"[fn-45-P4575_2253676:36-nf] From whom the Apostle wished so to cut off this occasion, that even what was justly due to him, he would forego. For this himself doth openly show in the second to the Corinthians, speaking of other Churches supplying his necessities. For he had come, as it appears, to so great indigence, that from distant Churches were sent supplies for his necessities, while yet from them among whom he was, he accepted nothing of that kind. \"Have I committed a sin, \"saith he, \"in humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the Gospel of God freely? Other Churches I despoiled, taking wages of them to minister unto you: and when I was present with you and wanted, to no man was I burdensome. For that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied, and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will keep myself. It is the truth of Christ in me, that this glory shall not be infringed in me in the regions of Achaia. Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. But what I do, I also mean to do, that I may cut off occasion from them which seek occasion, that wherein they glory they may be found as also we.\"[fn-45-P4576_2254878:37-nf] Of this occasion, therefore, which he here saith that he cuts off, he would have that understood which he saith in the former place, \"Neither for occasion of covetousness, God is witness.\" And what he here saith, \"In humbling myself that ye might be exalted:\" this in the first to the same Corinthians, \"I became to the weak as weak;\" this to the Thessalonians, \"I became small among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-45-P4577_2255338:38-nf] Now then observe what follows: \"So,\" saith he, \"being affectionately desirous of you, we are minded to impart unto you not alone the Gospel of God, but our own souls also; because ye are become most dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil, night and day working, that we might not burden any of you.\" For this he said above, \"When we might be burdensome to you, as Christ's Apostles.\" Because, then, the weak were in peril, lest, agitated by false suspicions, they should hate an, as it were, venal Gospel, for this cause, trembling for them as with a father's and a mother's bowels of compassion, did he this thing. So too in the Acts of the Apostles he speaks the same thing, when, sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he had called thence the presbyters of the Church, to whom, among much else, \"Silver,\" saith he, \"and gold, or apparel of no man have I coveted; yourselves know, that to my necessities and theirs who were with me these hands have ministered. In all things have I shown you that so laboring it behoveth to help the weak, mindful also of the words of the Lord Jesus, for that He said, More blessed is it rather to give than to receive.\"[fn-45-P4578_2256531:39-nf] 14. Here peradventure some man may say, \"If it was bodily work that the Apostle wrought, whereby to sustain this life, what was that same work, and when did he find time for it, both to work and to preach the Gospel?\" To whom I answer: Suppose I do not know; nevertheless that he did bodily work, and thereby lived in the flesh, and did not use the power which the Lord had given to the Apostles, that preaching the Gospel he should live by the Gospel, those things above-said do without all doubt bear witness. For it is not either in one place or briefly said, that it should be possible for any most astute arguer with all his tergiversation to traduce and pervert it to another meaning. Since then so great an authority, with so mighty and so frequent blows mauling the gainsayers, doth break in pieces their contrariness, why ask they of me either what sort of work he did, or when he did it? One thing I know, that he neither did steal, nor was a housebreaker or highwayman, nor chariot-driver or hunter or player, nor given to filthy lucre: but innocently and honestly wrought things which are fitted for the uses of men; such as are the works of carpenters, builders,shoemakers, peasants, and such like. For honesty itself reprehends not what their pride cloth reprehend, who love to be called, but love not to be, honest. The Apostle then would not disdain either to take in hand any work of peasants, or to be employed in the labor of craftsmen. For he who saith, \"Be ye without offense to Jews and to Greeks and to the Church of God,\"[fn-45-P4579_2258099:40-nf] before what men he could possibly stand abashed, I know not. If they shall say, the Jews; the Patriarchs fed cattle: if the Greeks, whom we call also Pagans; they have had philosophers, held in high honor, who were shoemakers: if the Church of God; that just man, elect to the testimony of a conjugal and ever-during virginity, to whom was betrothed the Virgin Mary who bore Christ, was a carpenter.[fn-45-P4580_2258519:41-nf] Whatever therefore of these with innocence and without fraud men do work, is good. For the Apostle himself takes precaution of this, that no man through necessity of sustaining life should turn aside to evil works. \"Let him that stole,\" saith he, \"steal no more; but rather let him labor good with his hands, that he may have to impart to him that needeth.\"[fn-45-P4581_2258898:42-nf] This then is enough to know, that also in the very work of the body the Apostle did work that which is good.","title":"Of the Work of Monks.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_47_concerning_the_nature_of_good_against_the_manichaeans_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"123","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"But fire is eternal, not as God is eternal, because, though without end, yet is not without beginning; but God is also without beginning.

Wherefore also in what follows He says: \"Take no anxious thought for the morrow; sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\"[fn-33-P3360_1000388:36-nf] Thus He enjoins them to lay aside the cares of this life, and depend on the Father alone. And he who fulfils this commandment is in reality a child and a son to God and to the world,-to the one as deceived, to the other as beloved. And if we have one Master in heaven, as the Scripture says, then by common consent those on the earth will be rightly called disciples. For so is the truth, that perfection is with the Lord, who is always teaching, and infancy and childishness with us, who are always learning. Thus prophecy hath honoured perfection, by applying to it the appellation man. For instance, by David, He says of the devil: \"The Lord abhors the man of blood; \"[fn-33-P3361_1001079:37-nf] he calls him man, as perfect in wickedness. And the Lord is called man, because He is perfect in righteousness. Directly in point is the instance of the apostle, who says, writing the Corinthians: \"For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-33-P3362_1001382:38-nf] whether as children or saints, but to the Lord alone. And writing to the Ephesians, he has unfolded in the clearest manner the point in question, speaking to the following effect: \"Till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we be no longer children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, by the craft of men, by their cunning in stratagems of deceit; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up to Him in all things,\"[fn-33-P3363_1001938:39-nf] -saying these things in order to the edification of the body of Christ, who is the head and man, the only one perfect in righteousness; and we who are children guarding against the blasts of heresies, which blow to our inflation; and not putting our trust in fathers who teach us otherwise, are then made perfect when we are the church, having received Christ the head. Then it is right to notice, with respect to the appellation of infant (nh/pioj), that to\\ nh/pion is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called nhpu/tioj: and nh/pioj is neh/pioj (since he that is tender-hearted is calledh !pioj), as being one that has newly become gentle and meek in Conduct. This the blessed Paul most clearly pointed out when he said, \"When we might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, we were gentle (h !pioi) among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-33-P3364_1002835:40-nf] The child (nh/pioj) is therefore gentle (h !pioj), and therefore more tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy, straightforward and upright in mind, which is the basis of simplicity and truth. For He says, \"Upon whom shall I look, but upon him who is gentle and quiet? \"[fn-33-P3365_1003156:41-nf] For such is the virgin speech, tender, and free of fraud; whence also a virgin is wont to be called \"a tender bride,\" and a child \"tender-hearted.\" And we are tender who are pliant to the power of persuasion, and are easily drawn to goodness, and are mild, and free of the stain of malice and perverseness, for the ancient race was perverse and hard-hearted; but the band of infants, the new people which we are, i.s delicate as a child. On account of the hearts of the innocent, the apostle, in the Epistle to the Romans, owns that he rejoices, and furnishes a kind of definition of children, so to speak, when he says, \"I would have you wise toward good, but simple towards evil.\"[fn-33-P3366_1003858:42-nf] For the name of child, nh/pioj, is not understood by us privatively, though the sons of the grammarians make thenh a privative particle. For if they call us who follow after childhood foolish, see how they utter blasphemy against the Lord, in regarding those as foolish who have betaken themselves to God. But if, which is rather the true sense, they themselves understand the designation children of simple ones, we glory in the name. For the new minds, which have newly become wise, which have sprung into being according to the new covenant, are infantile in the old folly.

For this reason Peter also, when they[fn-15-P1598_1275997:33-nf] had restored the lame man, and all were wondering at them, in order to restrain the people, and persuade them that they had exhibited nothing of this power of themselves, or from their native strength, says, \"Why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?\"[fn-15-P1599_1276671:34-nf] And again at Lystra, the people were not only filled with astonishment, but led forth bulls, after crowning them with garlands, and were preparing to offer sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas. Observe the malice of the Devil. By those very same persons through whom the Lord was at work, to purge out ungodliness from the world, by the same did that enemy try to introduce it, again persuading them to take men for gods; which was what he had done in former times. And this is especially that which introduced the principle and root of idolatry. For many after having had success in wars, and set up trophies, and built cities, and done divers other benefits of this kind to the people of those times, came to be esteemed gods by the multitude, and were honoured with temples, and altars; and the whole catalogue of the Grecian gods is made up of such men. That this, therefore, may not be done towards the Saints,[fn-16-P1600_1277618:35-nf] God permitted them constantly to be banished,-to be scourged,-to fall into diseases; that the abundance of bodily infirmity, and the multiplicity of those temptations, might convince those who were then with them, both that they were men, who wrought such wonders, and that they contributed nothing of their own power; but that it was mere grace, that wrought through them all these miracles. For if they took men for gods, who had done but mean and vile things, much rather would they have thought these to be such, had they suffered nothing proper to humanity, when they performed miracles, such as no one had ever before Seen or heard of. For if when they were scourged, thrown down precipices, imprisoned, banished, and placed in peril every day, there were, notwithstanding, some who fell into this impious opinion, how much rather would they have been thus regarded, had they endured nothing which belongs to human nature !","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":16,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_51_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"18. This then is the third cause of affliction; and the fourth is, that the saints might not be supposed to serve God from a hope of present prosperity. For many of those who live in debauchery, when blamed as they often are by many, and invited to the labours of virtue; and when they hear the saints commended for their cheerfulness under great hardships,[fn-16-P1602_1279060:36-nf] attack their character on this ground; and not men only, but the devil himself hath taken up this suspicion.

And if such be the case with regard to a man, much more in relation to God; which therefore that God might demonstrate, He gave more than the devil asked; for the latter said, \"Put forth thine hand, and touch him;\"[fn-16-P1607_1281102:41-nf] but God said not thus, but, \"I deliver him unto thee.\" For just as in the contests[fn-16-P1608_1281206:42-nf] of the outer world, the combatants that are vigorous, and in high condition of body,[fn-16-P1609_1281508:43-nf] are not so well discerned, when they are enwrapt all around with the garment soaked in oil; but when casting this aside, they are brought forward unclothed into the arena; then above all they strike the spectators on every side with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs, there being no longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he was enveloped in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many, what a man he was. But when, like the wrestler, that strips off his garment, he threw it aside, and came naked to the conflicts of piety, thus unclothed, he astonished all who saw him;[fn-16-P1610_1282141:44-nf] so that the very theatre of angels shouted at beholding his fortitude of soul, and applauded him as he won his crown! For, as I have already observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad in all that wealth, as when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited himself naked as it were in a theatre, in the midst of the world, and all admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only by his being stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by his patience in respect of his infirmity. And as I said before, God Himself did not smite him; in order that the devil might not again say, \"Thou hast spared him, and hast not inflicted so great a trial as was necessary:\" but he gave to the adversary the destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. \"I am sure,\" saith He, \"of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid thee to impose on him whatever struggles thou desirest.\" But as those who are well skilled in the sports of the palaestra, and have reason to rely on their art and bodily strength, often do not seize their antagonists upright, nor take an equal advantage, but suffer them to take them by the middle,[fn-16-P1611_1283421:45-nf] that they may make a more splendid conquest; so also God gave to the devil to take this saint by the waist, that when he had overcome, after an attack so greatly to his disadvantage, and stretched his adversary on the ground, his crown might be so much the more glorious!","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":16,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_51_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"19.

For when the offence is with us, then woe unto us, but when not with us, not so. And again, Woe to (that man) through whom \"the name of God is blasphemed.\" (Rom. ii. 24.) How then if I do what is right in anything, but another blasphemes? That is nothing to me, but only to him: for through him (God) was blasphemed. \"And how is it possible to do what is right in anything, and ,yet give a handle to the rest?\" Whence will ye that. I bring examples-from present, or from old times? Not to be easily scared (yofodeeij), shall we speak to the very point now in hand? Paul judaized in Jerusalem, but in Antioch not so: he judaized, and they were offended (p. 282, note 3), but those had no right to be offended. He is said to have saluted both Nero's cupbearer and his concubine:[fn-17-P1719_1680816:10-nf] what, think ye, must they have said against him because of this? But they had no right to do so. Since, if he drew them to him for[fn-17-P1720_1681288:11-nf] loose living or any wicked acts, one might well be offended: but if in order to right living, what is there to be offended at? Let me mention something that happened to one of my acquaintance. The wrath of God once fell upon (a city), and he being very young (was) in the order of deacon. The bishop was absent at the time, and of the presbyters none took thought for the matter, but indiscriminately they caused in one night immense numbers[fn-17-P1721_1681808:12-nf] of people to be baptized all at once, and they did indiscriminately receive baptism, all of them ignorant of everything: these he took apart by a hundred or two hundred together, and discoursed to them, not upon any other subject, but only on the sacraments, so that the unbaptized also were not allowed to be present. Many thought he did this because he coveted rule. But he cared not for that: neither however did he continue the thing for a (longer) time, but immediately desisted. When then? Was he the cause of the scandal? I think not. For if indeed he had done this without cause, they might with reason have ascribed it to him: and so again, if he had continued to do so. For when aught of what is pleasing to God is hindered by another's taking offence, it is right to take no notice: but then is the time to mind it, when we are not forced because of him to offend God. For, say, if, while we are discoursing and putting drunkards to shame (skwptontwn), any one take offence-am I to give over speaking? Hear Christ say, \"Will ye also go away?\" (John vi. 67.) So then, the right thing is, neither to take no notice, nor to take too much, of the weakness of the many. Do we not see the physicians acting thus: how, when it may be done, they humor the whims of their patients, but when the gratification does harm, then they will not spare? Always it is good to know the right mean. Many reviled, because a certain beautiful virgin stayed, and they railed upon those who catechised (her). What then? Was it their duty to desist for that? By no means. For let us not look to this only, whether some be offended, but whether they are justly offended, and[fn-17-P1722_1683567:13-nf] so that it is no hurt to ourselves (to give way). \"If meat,\" saith (Paul), \"offend my brother, I will eat no meat as long as the world lasts.\" (1 Cor. viii. 13..) With reason: for the not eating did (him) no harm. If however it offend him, that I wish to renounce (apotacasqai) (the world), it is not right to mind him. And whom, you will ask, does this offend? Many, to my knowledge. When therefore the hindrance is a thing indifferent, let (the thing) be done[fn-17-P1723_1684503:14-nf] . Else, if we were to look only to this, many are the things we have to desist from: just as, on the other hand, if we should despise (all objections), we have to destroy many (brethren). As in fact Paul also took thought beforehand concerning offence: \"Lest,\" he says, \"in this liberality which is administered by us:\" for it was attended with no loss (to him) to obviate an ill surmise. But when we fall into such a necessity as that great evils should ensue through the other's taking offence[fn-17-P1724_1685693:15-nf] let us pay no heed to that person. He has to thank himself for it, and we are not now accountable, for it was not possible to spare him without hurt (to ourselves). Some were offended, because certain believers sat down to meat in (heathen) temples. It was not right to sit down: for no harm came of this (their not doing it). They were offended, because Peter ate with the Gentiles. But he indeed spared them, but (Paul)[fn-17-P1725_1686430:16-nf] not so. On all occasions it behooves us in following the laws of God to take great pains that we give no matter of offence; that both ourselves may not have to answer for it, and may have mercy vouchsafed us from God, by the grace and loving-kindness of His only-begotten Son, with Whom to the Father and Holy Ghost together be glory, dominion, honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.","title":"Homily XLVI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":16,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The most of men have a disposition unstable and heedless, like the nature of storms. \"Want of faith has done many good things, and faith evil things.\" And Epicharmus says, \"Don't forget to exercise incredulity; for it is the sinews of the soul.\" Now, to disbelieve truth brings death, as to believe, life; and again, to believe the lie and to disbelieve the truth hutries to destruction. The same is the case with self-restraint and licentiousness. To restrain one's self from doing good is the work of vice; but to keep from wrong is the beginning of salvation. So the Sabbath, by abstinence from evils, seems to indicate self-restraint. And what, I ask, is it in which man differs from beasts, and the angels of God, on the other hand, are wiser than he? \"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels.\"[fn-66-P6625_2016054:3-nf] For some do not interpret this Scripture of the Lord, although He also bore flesh, but of the perfect man and the gnostic, inferior in comparison with the angels in time, and by reason of the vesture [of the body]. I call then wisdom nothing but science, since life differs not from life. For to live is common to the mortal nature, that is to man, with that to which has been vouchsafed immortality; as also the faculty of contemplation and of self-restraint, one of the two being more excellent. On this ground Pythagoras seems to me to have said that God alone is wise, since also the apostle writes in the Epistle to the Romans, \"For the obedience of the faith among all nations, being made known to the only wise God through Jesus Christ; \"[fn-66-P6626_2016816:4-nf] and that he himself was a philosopher, on account of his friendship with God. Accordingly it is said, \"God talked with Moses as a friend with a friend.\"[fn-66-P6627_2016990:5-nf] That, then, which is true being clear to God, forthwith generates truth. And the gnostic loves the truth. \"Go,\" it is said, \"to the ant, thou sluggard, and be the disciple of the bee; \"thus speaks Solomon.[fn-66-P6628_2017215:6-nf] For if there is one function belonging to the peculiar nature of each creature, alike of the ox, and horse, and dog, what shall we say is the peculiar function of man? He is like, it appears to me, the Centaur, a Thessalian figment, compounded of a rational and irrational part, of soul and body. Well, the body tills the ground, and hastes to it; but the soul is raised to God: trained in the true philosophy, it speeds to its kindred above, turning away from the lusts of the body, and besides these, from toil and fear, although we have shown that patience and fear belong to the good man. For if \"by the law is the knowledge of sin,\"[fn-66-P6629_2017872:7-nf] as those allege who disparage the law, and \"till the law sin was in the world; \"[fn-66-P6630_2017970:8-nf] yet \"without the law sin was dead,\"[fn-66-P6631_2018023:9-nf] we oppose them. For when you take away the cause of fear, sin, you have taken away fear; and much more, punishment, when you have taken away that which gives rise to lust. \"For the law is not made for the just man,\"[fn-66-P6632_2018257:10-nf] says the Scripture. Well, then, says Heraclitus, \"They would not have known the name of Justice if these things had not been.\" And Socrates says, \"that the law was not made for the sake of the good.\" But the cavillers did not know even this, as the apostle says, \"that he who loveth his brother worketh not evil; \"for this, \"Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended in the word, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-66-P6633_2018789:11-nf] So also is it said, \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-66-P6634_2018932:12-nf] And \"if he that loveth his neighbour worketh no evil,\" and if \"every commandment is comprehended in this, the loving our neighbour,\" the commandments, by menacing with fear, work love, not hatred. Wherefore the law is productive of the emotion of fear. \"So that the law is holy,\" and in truth \"spiritual,\"[fn-66-P6635_2019255:13-nf] according to the apostle. We must, then, as is fit, in investigating the nature of the body and the essence of the soul, apprehend the end of each, and not regard death as an evil. \"For when ye were the servants of sin,\" says the apostle, \"ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things in which ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-66-P6636_2019884:14-nf] The assertion, then, may be hazarded, that it has been shown that death is the fellowship of the soul in a state of sin with the body; and life the separation from sin.

For after saying that the Gospel is the cause of salvation and of life, that it is the power of God, that it gendereth salvation and righteousness, he mentions what might well make them fear that were heedless of it. For since in general most men are not drawn so much by the promise of what is good as by the fear of what is painful, he draws them on both sides. For this cause too did God not only promise a kingdom, but also threaten hell. And the Prophets spake thus with the Jews, ever intermingling the evil with the good. For this cause too Paul thus varies his discourse, yet not any how, but he sets first the good things, and after the evil, to show that the former came of the guiding purpose of God, but the latter of the wickedness of the backsliding. And in this way the prophet puts the good first, saying, \"If ye be willing and will obey me, ye shall eat the good of the land: but if ye be not willing and will not obey me, the sword shall devour you.\" (Is. i. 19, 20.) So here too does Paul conduct his discourse. But observe him; Christ, he means, came to bring forgiveness, righteousness, life, yet not in any way, but by the Cross, which is greatest too and wonderful, that He not only gave such things, but that He also suffered such things. If then ye insolently scorn the gifts, then will the penalties await you, And see how he raises his language, \"For the wrath of God,\" he says, \"is revealed from heaven.\" Whence does this appear? If it be a believer who says this, we will tell him of the declarations of Christ, but if the unbeliever and the Grecian, him Paul silences, by what he says presently of the judgment of God, bringing an uncontrovertible demonstration from the things which were done by them. And this too is by far the most striking point in him, how he exhibits those who speak against the truth, as themselves bearing witness by the things which they do daily, and say, to the doctrines of the truth. But of this in the sequel: but for the present, let us keep to what is set before us. \"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven.\" And indeed even here this often takes place in famines and pestilences and wars: for each individually and all in common are punished. What will be the new thing then? That the chastisement will be greater, and common to all, and not by the same rules. For now what takes place is for correction; but then for vengeance.[fn-20-P2035_2035185:1-nf] And this also St. Paul showed, when he said, \"We are chastened now, that we should not be condemned with the world.\" (1 Cor. xi. 32.) And now indeed to many such things usually seem to come not of the wrath from above, but of the malice of man. But then the punishment from God shall be manifest, when the Judge, sitting upon the fearful tribunal, shall command some to be dragged to the furnaces, and some to the outer darkness,[fn-20-P2036_2036283:2-nf] and some to other inexorable and intolerable punishments. And why is it that he does not speak as plainly as this, the Son of God is coming with ten thousand angels, and will call each man to account, but says, that \"the wrath of God is revealed?\" His hearers were as yet novices, and therefore he draws them first by things quite allowed by them. And besides what is here mentioned, he also seems to me to be aiming against the Greeks. And this is why he makes his beginning from this, but afterwards he introduces the subject of Christ's judgment.","title":"Homily III.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":16,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_25_the_first_epistle_of_the_blessed_clement","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Such are the ways of all those who do not work, but go hunting for tales, and think to themselves that this is profitable and right.[fn-10-P1043_261806:94-nf] For such persons are like those idle and prating widows \"who go wandering about[fn-10-P1044_261924:95-nf] among houses\"[fn-10-P1045_261971:96-nf] with their prating, and hunt for idle tales, and carry them from house to house with much exaggeration, without fear of God.

And they hearken not to that which the Scripture has said: \"Let not many be teachers among you, my brethren, and be not all of you prophets.\"[fn-10-P1047_262770:98-nf] For \"he who does not transgress in word is a perfect man, able to keep down and subjugate his whole body.\"[fn-10-P1048_262994:99-nf] And, \"If a man speak, let him speak in the words[fn-10-P1049_263062:100-nf] of God.\"[fn-10-P1050_263093:101-nf] And, \"If there is in thee understanding, give an answer to thy brother but if not, put thy hand on thy mouth.\"[fn-10-P1051_263226:102-nf] For, \"at one time it is proper to keep silence, and at another thee to speak.\"[fn-10-P1052_263326:103-nf] And again it says \"When a man speaks in season, it is honourable[fn-10-P1053_263412:104-nf] to him.\"[fn-10-P1054_263446:105-nf] And again it says: \"Let your speech be seasoned with grace.

We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,[fn-26-P2661_896588:9-nf] nor unlike[fn-26-P2662_896638:10-nf] the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality[fn-26-P2663_897082:11-nf] is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called \"god\" as in the words, \"I have said ye are gods,\"[fn-26-P2664_897294:12-nf] and \"daemon\" as in the words, \"The gods of the nations are daemons,\"[fn-26-P2665_897383:13-nf] in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone is substantially and essentially God. When I say \"alone\" I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and substance of God. For the word \"alone\" is used in the case of any individual and generally of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and \"heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-26-P2666_897874:14-nf] and of human nature, as when David says, \"as for man his days are as grass,\"[fn-26-P2667_897971:15-nf] not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, \"who alone hath immortality\"[fn-26-P2668_898174:16-nf] and \"to God only wise,\"[fn-26-P2669_898218:17-nf] and \"none is good save one, that is God,\"[fn-26-P2670_898279:18-nf] for here \"one\" means the same as alone. So also, \"which alone spreadest out the heavens,\"[fn-26-P2671_898390:19-nf] and again \"Thou shall worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-26-P2672_898486:20-nf] \"There is no God beside me.\"[fn-26-P2673_898690:21-nf] In Scripture \"one\" and \"only\" are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so called.As for instance, \"The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them,\"[fn-26-P2674_898962:22-nf] and \"then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and didserve the Lord only.\"[fn-26-P2675_899086:23-nf] And so St. Paul, \"For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but out god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things.\"[fn-26-P2676_899285:24-nf] Here we enquire why when he had said \"one God\" he was not content, for we have said that \"one\" and \"only\" when applied to God, indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase \"one God.\" without, by the further addition of \"the Father,\" expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifyings the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of \"Jesus Christ,\" and charges His disciples to \"tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ.\"[fn-26-P2677_900209:25-nf] For His purpose was, after the completion of the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2678_900288:26-nf] after His resurrection froth the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words \"That they may know Thee the only true God and JesUs Christ whom thou hast sent,\"[fn-26-P2679_900611:27-nf] and again \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me.\"[fn-26-P2680_900681:28-nf] Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in else direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2681_900878:29-nf] and so by omission falling into impiety.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
