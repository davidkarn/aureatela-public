{"verses":["I say then:  Hath God cast away his people?  God forbid!  For I\nalso am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.","God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.  Know you not\nwhat the scripture saith of Elias, how he calleth on God against\nIsrael?","Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have dug down thy\naltars.  And I am left alone:  and they seek my life.","But what saith the divine answer to him?  I have left me seven\nthousand men that have not bowed their knees to Baal.","Even so then, at this present time also, there is a remnant saved\naccording to the election of grace.","And if by grace, it is not now by works:  otherwise grace is no\nmore grace.","What then?  That which Israel sought, he hath not obtained:  but\nthe election hath obtained it.  And the rest have been blinded.","As it is written:  God hath given them the spirit of\ninsensibility; eyes that they should not see and ears that they should\nnot hear, until this present day.","And David saith:  Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a\nstumbling block and a recompense unto them.","Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see:  and bow down\ntheir back always.","I say then:  Have they so stumbled, that they should fall?  God\nforbid!  But by their offence salvation is come to the Gentiles, that\nthey may be emulous of them.","Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world and the\ndiminution of them the riches of the Gentiles:  how much more the\nfulness of them?","For I say to you, Gentiles:  As long indeed as I am the apostle\nof the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,","If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my\nflesh and may save some of them.","For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what\nshall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?","For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also:  and if the\nroot be holy, so are the branches.","And if some of the branches be broken and thou, being a wild\nolive, art ingrafted in them and art made partaker of the root and of\nthe fatness of the olive tree:","Boast not against the branches.  But if thou boast, thou bearest\nnot the root:  but the root thee.","Thou wilt say then:  The branches were broken off that I might be\ngrafted in.","Well:  because of unbelief they were broken off.  But thou\nstandest by faith.  Be not highminded, but fear.","For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest\nperhaps also he spare not thee.","See then the goodness and the severity of God:  towards them\nindeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of\nGod, if thou abide in goodness.  Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.","And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be\ngrafted in:  for God is able to graft them in again.","For if thou were cut out of the wild olive tree, which is\nnatural to thee; and, contrary to nature, wert grafted into the good\nolive tree:  how much more shall they that are the natural branches be\ngrafted into their own olive tree?","For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery\n(lest you should be wise in your own conceits) that blindness in part\nhas happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come\nin.","And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written:  There shall\ncome out of Sion, he that shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness\nfrom Jacob.","And this is to them my covenant:  when I shall take away their\nsins.","As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your\nsake:  but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of\nthe fathers.","For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.","For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have\nobtained mercy, through their unbelief:","So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they\nalso may obtain mercy.","For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy\non all.","O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of\nGod!  How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his\nways!","For who hath known the mind of the Lord?  Or who hath been his\ncounsellor?","Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made\nhim?","For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things:  to him be\nglory for ever.  Amen."]}
