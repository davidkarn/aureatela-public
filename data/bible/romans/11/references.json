And what is meant by, To Him be glory, but to Him be chief and perfect and widespread praise? For as the praise improves and extends, so the love and affection increases in fervor. And when this is the case, mankind cannot but advance with sure and firm step to a life of perfection and bliss. This, I suppose, is all we wish to find when we speak of the chief good of man, to which all must be referred in life and conduct. For the good plainly exists; and we have shown by reasoning, as far as we were able, and by the divine authority which goes beyond our reasoning, that it is nothing else but God Himself. For how can any thing be man's chief good but that in cleaving to which he is blessed?

You have a grand and true consolation, if you maintain a good conscience, and know that you did not consent to the sins of those who were permitted to commit sinful outrage upon you. And if you should ask why this permission was granted, indeed it is a deep providence of the Creator and Governor of the world; and \"unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out.\"[fn-3-P356_123017:55-nf] Nevertheless, faithfully interrogate your own souls, whether ye have not been unduly puffed up by your integrity, and continence, and chastity; and whether ye have not been so desirous of the human praise that is accorded to these virtues, that ye have envied some who possessed them. I, for my part, do not know your hearts, and therefore I make no accusation; I do not even hear what your hearts answer when you question them. And yet, if they answer that it is as I have supposed it might be, do not marvel that you have lost that by which you can win men's praise, and retain that which cannot be exhibited to men. If you did not consent to sin, it was because God added His aid to His grace that it might not be lost, and because shame before men succeeded to human glory that it might not be loved. But in both respects even the faint-hearted among you have a consolation, approved by the one experience, chastened by the other; justified by the one, corrected by the other. As to those whose hearts, when interrogated, reply that they have never been proud of the virtue of virginity, widowhood, or matrimonial chastity, but, condescending to those of low estate, rejoiced with trembling in these gifts of God, and that they have never envied any one the like excellences of sanctity and purity, but rose superior to human applause, which is wont to be abundant in proportion to the rarity of the virtue applauded, and rather desired that their own number be increased, than that by the smallness of their numbers each of them should be conspicuous;-even such faithful women, I say, must not complain that permission was given to the barbarians so grossly to outrage them; nor must they allow themselves to believe that God overlooked their character when He permitted acts which no one with impunity commits. For some most flagrant and wicked desires are allowed free play at present by the secret judgment of God, and are reserved to the public and final judgment. Moreover, it is possible that those Christian women, who are unconscious of any undue pride on account of their virtuous chastity, whereby they sinlessly suffered the violence of their captors, had yet some lurking infirmity which might have betrayed them into a proud and contemptuous bearing, had they not been subjected to the humiliation that befell them in the taking of the city. As, therefore, some men were removed by death, that no wickedness might change their disposition, so these women were outraged lest prosperity should corrupt their modesty. Neither those women then, who were already puffed up by the circumstance that they were still virgins, nor those who might have been so puffed up had they not been exposed to the violence of the enemy, lost their chastity, but rather gained humility; the former were saved from pride already cherished, the latter from pride that would shortly have grown upon them.","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_08_iv_the_testament_of_judah_concerning_fortitude_and_love_of_money_and_fornication_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"ANF-08","text":"22.

Hence also the sevenfold operation of the Holy Ghost, of which Isaiah speaks,[fn-2-P265_50304:30-nf] seems to me to correspond to these stages and sentences. But there is a difference of order: for there the enumeration begins with the more excellent, but here with the inferior. For there it begins with wisdom, and closes with the fear of God: but \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" And therefore, if we reckon as it were in a gradually ascending series, there the fear of God is first, piety second, knowledge third, fortitude fourth, counsel fifth, understanding sixth, wisdom seventh. The fear of God corresponds to the humble, of whom it is here said, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit,\" i.e. those not puffed up, not proud: to whom the apostle says, \"Be not high-minded, but fear;\"[fn-2-P266_51026:31-nf] i.e. be not lifted up. Piety[fn-2-P267_51073:32-nf] corresponds to the meek: for he who inquires piously honours Holy Scripture, and does not censure what he does not yet understand, and on this account does not offer resistance; and this is to be meek: whence it is here said, \"Blessed are the meek.\" Knowledge corresponds to those that mourn who already have found out in the Scriptures by what evils they are held chained which they ignorantly have coveted as though they were good and useful. Fortitude corresponds to those hungering and thirsting: for they labour in earnestly desiring joy from things that are truly good, and in eagerly seeking to turn away their love from earthly and corporeal things: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst afterrighteousness.\" Counsel corresponds to the merciful: for this is the one remedy for escaping from so great evils, that we forgive, as we wish to be ourselves forgiven; and that we assist others so far as we are able, as we ourselves desire to be assisted where we are not able: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are the merciful.\" Understanding corresponds to the pure in heart, the eye being as it were purged, by which that may be beheld which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and what hath not entered into the heart of man:[fn-2-P268_52468:33-nf] and of them it is here said,\" Blessed are the pure in heart.\" Wisdom corresponds to the peacemakers, in whom all things are now brought into order, and no passion is in a state of rebellion against reason, but all things together obey the spirit of man, while he himself also obeys God: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\"[fn-2-P269_52851:34-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"25. But now of the clouds, and voices, and lightnings, and the trumpet, and the smoke on Mount Sinai, when it was said, \"And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire, and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and all the people that was in the camp trembled; and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\"[fn-5-P580_215091:89-nf] And a little after, when the Law had been given in the ten commandments, it follows in the text, \"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking.\" And a little after, \"And [when the people saw it,] they removed and stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness[fn-5-P581_215456:90-nf] where God was, and the Lord said unto Moses,\"[fn-5-P582_215517:91-nf] etc. What shall I say about this, save that no one can be so insane as to believe the smoke, and the fire, and the cloud, and the darkness, and whatever there was of the kind, to be the substance of the word and wisdom of God which is Christ, or of the Holy Spirit? For not even the Arians ever dared to say that they were the substance of God the Father. All these things, then, were wrought through the creature serving the Creator, and were presented in a suitable economy (dispensatio) to human senses; unless, perhaps, because it is said,\"And Moses drew near to the cloud where God was,\" carnal thoughts must needs suppose that the cloud was indeed seen by the people, but that within the cloud Moses with the eyes of the flesh saw the Son of God, whom doting heretics will have to be seen in His own substance. Forsooth, Moses may have seen Him with the eyes of the flesh, if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ, but even that of any man you please and howsoever wise, can be seen with the eyes of the flesh; or if, because it is written of the elders of Israel, that \"they saw the place where the God of Israel had stood,\" and that \"there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness,\"[fn-5-P583_216807:92-nf] therefore we are to believe that the word and wisdom of God in His own substance stood within the space of an earthly place, who indeed \"reacheth firmly from end to end, and sweetly ordereth all things;\"[fn-5-P584_217030:93-nf] and that the Word of God, by whom all things were made,[fn-5-P585_217106:94-nf] is in such wise changeable, as now to contract, now to expand Himself; (may the Lord cleanse the hearts of His faithful ones from such thoughts!)

For when in one and the same Scriptural authority we read: \"All things are of God,\"[fn-7-P764_387483:14-nf] and elsewhere: \"Ye are not of God,\" since it is wrong rashly to condemn books of Scripture, who would not have seen that a skilled teacher should be found who would know a solution of this problem, from whom assuredly if endowed with good intellectual powers, and a \"spiritual man,\" as is said by divine inspiration[fn-7-P765_387819:15-nf] (for he would necessarily have favored the true arguments concerning the intelligible and sensible nature, which, as far as I can, I have conducted and handled, nay he would have disclosed them far better and more convincingly); we should have heard nothing else concerning this problem, except, as might happen, that there is no class of souls but has its existence from God, and that it is yet rightly said to sinners and unbelievers: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we also, perchance, Divine aid having been implored, should have been able easily to see, that it is one thing to live and another to sin, and (although life in sin may be called death in comparison with just life,[fn-7-P766_388516:16-nf] and while in one man it may be found, that he is at the same time alive and a sinner) that so far as he is alive, he is of God, so far as he is a sinner he is not of God. In which division we use that alternative that suits our sentiment; so that when we wish to insist upon the omnipotence of God as Creator, we may say even to sinners that they are of God. For we are speaking to those who are contained in some class, we are speaking to those having animal life, we are speaking to rational beings, we are speaking lastly-and this applies especially to the matter in hand-to living beings, all which things are essentially divine functions. But when our purpose is to convict evil men, we rightly say: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we speak to them as averse to truth, unbelieving, criminal, infamous, and, to sum up all in one term-sinners, all of which things are undoubtedly not of God. Therefore what wonder is it, if Christ says to sinners, convicting them of this very thing that they were sinners and did not believe in Him: \"Ye are not of God;\" and on the other hand, without prejudice to the former statement: \"All things were made through Him,\" and \"All things are of God?\" For if not to believe Christ, to repudiate Christ's advent, not to accept Christ, was a sure mark of souls that are not of God; and so it was said: \"Ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God;\" how would that saying of the apostle be true that occurs in the memorable beginning of the gospel: \"He came unto his own things, and his own people did not receive him?\"[fn-7-P767_390086:17-nf] Whence his own if they did not receive him; or whence therefore not his own because they did not receive him, unless that sinners by virtue of being men belong to God, but by virtue of being sinners belong to the devil?

Either they have been delivered from their sins, in which case the power of Christ to save all men is proved; or they remain undelivered and as it were still under the charge of misdoing, in which case Christ is proved to be powerless.

For He is both said to dwell between the cherubims,[fn-10-P1048_422148:12-nf] which is spoken in respect to position; and to be covered with the deep as with a garment,[fn-10-P1049_422258:13-nf] which is said in respect to condition; and \"Thy years shall have no end,\"[fn-10-P1050_422349:14-nf] which is said in respect of time; and, \"If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there,\"[fn-10-P1051_422452:15-nf] which is said in respect to place. And as respects action (or making), perhaps it may be said most truly of God alone, for God alone makes and Himself is not made. Nor is He liable to passions as far as belongs to that substance whereby He is God. So the Father is omnipotent, the Son omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit is omnipotent; yet not three omnipotents, but one omnipotent:[fn-10-P1052_422851:16-nf] \"For of Him are all things, and through Him are all things, and in Him are all things; to whom be glory.\"[fn-10-P1053_423168:17-nf] Whatever, therefore, is spoken of God in respect to Himself, is both spoken singly of each person, that is, of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and together of the Trinity itself, not plurally but in the singular. For inasmuch as to God it is not one thing to be, and another thing to be great, but to Him it is the same thing to be, as it is to be great; therefore, as we do not say three essences, so we do not say three greatnesses, but one essence and one greatness. I say essence, which in Greek is called ousia, and which we call more usually substance.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now there is much significance in that He does not say, \"The wrath of God shall come upon him,\" but \"abideth on him.\" For from this wrath (in which we are all involved under sin, and of which the apostle says, \"For we too were once by nature the children of wrath, even as others \"[fn-4-P449_369682:88-nf] ) nothing delivers us but the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Therefore all these things which are made by divine skill, show in themselves a certain unity, and form, and order; for each of them is both some one thing, as are the several natures of bodies and dispositions of souls; and is fashioned in some form, as are the figures or qualities of bodies, and the various learning or skill of souls; and seeks or preserves a certain order, as are the several weights or combinations of bodies and the loves or delights of souls.

It will follow that we should next in order point out the character of the provision of blessings bestowed on us by the Father \"through him.\" Inasmuch as all created nature, both this visible world and all that is conceived of in the mind, cannot hold together without the care and providence of God, the Creator Word, the Only begotten God, apportioning His succour according to the measure of the needs of each, distributes mercies various and manifold on account of the many kinds and characters of the recipients of His bounty, but appropriate to the necessities of individual requirements. Those that are confined in the darkness of ignorance He enlightens: for this reason He is true Light.[fn-13-P1354_322518:171-nf] Portioning requital in accordance with the desert of deeds, He judges: for this reason He is righteous Judge.[fn-13-P1355_322649:172-nf] \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.\"[fn-13-P1356_322744:173-nf] Those that have lapsed from the lofty height of life into sin He raises from their fall: for this reason He is Resurrection.[fn-13-P1357_322890:174-nf] Effectually working by the much of His power and the will of His goodness He does all things. He shepherds; He enlightens; He nourishes; He heals; He guides; He raises up; He calls into being things that were not; He upholds what has been created. Thus the good things that come from God reach us \"through the Son,\" who works in each case with greater speed than speech can utter. For not lightnings, not light's course in air, is so swift; not eyes' sharp turn, not the movements of our very thought. Navy by the divine energy is each one of these in speed further surpassed than is the slowest of all living creatures outdone in motion by birds, or even winds, or the rush of the heavenly bodies: or, not to mention these, by our very thought itself.

I received \"a commandment what I should say and what I should speak.\"[fn-13-P1364_326639:181-nf] Through all these words He is guiding us to the knowledge of the Father, and referring our wonder at all that is brought into existence to Him, to the end that \"through Him\" we may know the Father.

In the meantime, however, I was told that a certain person, under the influence of an evil spirit, had asked why Martin, who was said to have raised the dead and to have rescued houses from the flames, had himself recently become subject to the power of fire, and thus been exposed to suffering of a dangerous character. Wretched man, whoever he is, that expressed himself thus! We recognize his perfidious talk in the words of the Jews of old, who reviled the Lord, when hanging upon the cross, in the following terms: \"He saved others; himself he cannot save.\"[fn-3-P325_89357:1-nf] Truly it is clear that, whoever be the person referred to, if he had lived in those times, he would have been quite prepared to speak against the Lord in these terms, inasmuch as he blasphemes a saint of the Lord, after a like fashion. How then, I askthee, whosoever thou art, how does the casestand? Was Martin really not possessed of power, and not a partaker of holiness, becausehe became exposed to danger from fire? O thou blessed man, and in all things like to the Apostles, even in the reproaches which are thus heaped upon thee! Assuredly those Gentiles are reported to have entertained the same sort of thought respecting Paul also, when the viper had bitten him, for they said, \"This man must be a murderer, whom, although saved from the sea, the fates do not permit to live.\"[fn-3-P326_91388:2-nf] But he, shaking off the viper into the fire, suffered no harm. They, however, imagined that he would suddenly fall down, and speedily die; but whenthey saw that no harm befell him, changing theirminds, they said that he was a God. But, O thou most miserable of men, you ought, even from that example to have yourself been convinced of your falsity; so that, if it had proved a stumbling-block to thee that Martin appeared touched by the flame of fire, you should, on the other hand, have ascribed his being merely touched to his merits and power, because, though surrounded by flames, he did not perish. For acknowledge, thou miserable man, acknowledge what you seem ignorant of, that almost all the saints have been more remarkable for[fn-3-P327_92149:3-nf] the dangers they encountered, than even for the virtues they displayed. I see, indeed, Peter strong in faith, walking over the waves of the sea, in opposition to the nature of things, and that he pressed the unstable waters with his footprints. But not on that account does the preacher of the Gentiles[fn-3-P328_92471:4-nf] seem to me a smaller man, whom the waves swallowed up; and, after three days[fn-3-P329_92645:5-nf] and three nights, the water restored him emerging from the deep. Nay, I am almost inclined to think that it was a greater thing to have lived in the deep, than to have walked along the depths of the sea. But, thou foolish man, you had not, as I suppose, read these things; or, having read them, had not understood them. For the blessed Evangelist would not have recorded in holy writ an incident of that kind -under divine guidance-(except that, from such cases, the human mind might be instructed as to the dangers connected with shipwrecks and serpents!) and, as the Apostle relates, who gloried in his nakedness, and hunger, and perils from robbers, all these things are indeed to be endured in common by holy men, but that it has always been the chief excellence of the righteous in enduring and conquering such things, while amid all their trials, being patient and ever unconquerable, they overcame them all the more courageously, the heavier was the burden which they had to bear. Hence this event which is ascribed to the infirmity of Martin is, in reality, full of dignity and glory, since indeed, being tried by a most dangerous calamity, he came forth a conqueror. But let no one wonder that the incident referred to was omitted by me in that treatise which I wrote concerning his life, since in that very work I openly acknowledged that I had not embraced all his acts; and that for the good reason that, if I had been minded to narrate them all, I must have presented an enormous volume to my readers. And indeed, his achievements were not of so limited a number that they could all be comprehended in a book. Nevertheless, I shall not leave this incident, about which a question has arisen, to remain in obscurity, but shall relate the whole affair as it occurred, lest I should appear perchance to have intentionally passed over that which might be put forward in calumniation of the saintly man.","title":"Letter I.

For how can it be that \"the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,\" if what follows is also true: \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man?\"[fn-13-P1363_675512:56-nf] For who but a righteous man lawfully uses the law? Yet it is not for him that it is made, but for the unrighteous. Must then the unrighteous man, in order that he may be justified,- that is, become a righteous man,- lawfully use the law, to lead him, as by the schoolmaster's hand,[fn-13-P1364_675812:57-nf] to that grace by which alone he can fulfil what the law commands? Now it is freely that he is justified thereby,-that is, on account of no antecedent merits of his own works; \"otherwise grace is no more grace,\"[fn-13-P1365_676042:58-nf] since it is bestowed on us, not because we have done good works, but that we may be able to do them,- in other words, not because we have fulfilled the law, but in order that we may be able to fulfil the law. Now He said, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-13-P1366_676335:59-nf] of whom it was said, \"We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-13-P1367_676474:60-nf] This is the glory which is meant in the words, \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\"[fn-13-P1368_676593:61-nf] and this the grace of which he speaks in the next verse, \"Being justified freely by His grace.\"[fn-13-P1369_676709:62-nf] The unrighteous man therefore lawfully uses the law, that he may become righteous; but when he has become so, he must no longer use it as a chariot, for he has arrived at his journey's end,- or rather (that I may employ the apostle's own simile, which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he is now fully learned. How then is the law not made for a righteous man, if it is necessary for the righteous man too, not that hemay be brought as an unrighteous man to the grace that justifies, but that he may use it lawfully, now that he is righteous? Does not the case perhaps stand thus, -nay, not perhaps, but rather certainly,- that the man who is become righteous thus lawfully uses the law, when he applies it to alarm the unrighteous, so that whenever the disease of some unusual desire begins in them, too, to be augmented by the incentive of the law's prohibition and an increased amount of transgression, they may in faith flee for refuge to the grace that justifies, and becoming delighted with the sweet pleasures of holiness, may escape the penalty of the law's menacing letter through the spirit's soothing gift? In this way the two statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each other: even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the law be not made for the righteous man; for it is not by the law that he becomes righteous, but by the law of faith, which led him to believe that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling the precepts which \"the law of works\"[fn-13-P1370_678276:63-nf] commanded, except to be assisted by the grace of God.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"161","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now he could not mean to contradict himself in saying, \"The doers of the law shall be justified,\"[fn-16-P1612_742018:218-nf] as if their justification came through their works, and not through grace; since he declares that a man is justified freely by His grace without the works of the law,[fn-16-P1613_742205:219-nf] intending by the term \"freely\" nothing else than that works do not precede justification. For in another passage he expressly says, \"If by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.\"[fn-16-P1614_742442:220-nf] But the statement that \"thedoers of the law shall be justified \"[fn-16-P1615_742526:221-nf] must be so understood, as that we may know that they are not otherwise doers of the law, unless they be justified, so that justification does not subsequently accrue to them as doers of the law, but justification precedes them as doers of the law. For what else does the phrase \"being justified\" signify than being made righteous, - by Him, of course, who justifies the ungodly man, that he may become a godly one instead? For if we were to express a certain fact by saying, \"The men will be liberated,\" the phrase would of course be understood as asserting that the liberation would accrue to those who were men already; but if we were to say, The men will be created, we should certainly not be understood as asserting that the creation would happen to those who were already in existence, but that they became men by the creation itself. If in like manner it were said, The doers of the law shall be honoured, we should only interpret the statement correctly if we supposed that the honour was to accrue to those who were already doers of the law: but when the allegation is, \"The doers of the law shall be justified,\" what else does it mean than that the just shall be justified? for of course the doers of the law are just persons. And thus it amounts to the same thing as if it were said, The doers of the law shall be created,- not those who were so already, but that they may become such; in order that the Jews who were hearers of the law might hereby understand that they wanted the grace of the Justifier, in order to be able to become its doers also. Or else the term \"They shall be justified\" is used in the sense of, They shall be deemed, or reckoned as just, as it is predicated of a certain man in the Gospel, \"But he, willing to justify himself,\"[fn-16-P1616_744310:222-nf] - meaning that he wished to be thought and accounted just. In like manner, we attach one meaning to the statement, \"God sanctifies His saints,\" and another to the words, \"Sanctified be Thy name; \"[fn-16-P1617_744526:223-nf] for in the former case we suppose the words to mean that He makes those to be saints who were not saints before, and in the latter, that the prayer would have that which is always holy in itself be also regarded as holy by men, - in a word, be feared with a hallowed awe.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":48,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"If therefore the apostle, when he mentioned that the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the law, and have the work of the law written in their hearts,[fn-16-P1621_745051:224-nf] intended those to be understood who believed in Christ, - who do not come to the faith like the Jews, through a precedent law,-there is no good reason why we should endeavour to distinguish them from those to whom the Lord by the prophet promises the new covenant, telling them that He will write His laws in their hearts,[fn-16-P1622_745398:225-nf] inasmuch as they too, by the grafting which he says had been made of the wild olive, belong to the self-same olive-tree,[fn-16-P1623_745542:226-nf] -in other words, to the same people of God. There is therefore a good agreement of this passage of the apostle with the words of the prophet so that belonging to the new testament means having the law of God not written on tables, but on the heart,- that is, embracing the righteousness of the law with innermost affection, where faith works by love.[fn-16-P1624_745913:227-nf] Because it isby faith that God justifies the Gentiles;\" and the Scripture foreseeing this, preached the gospel before to Abraham, saying, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed,\"[fn-16-P1625_746112:228-nf] in order that by this grace of promise the wild olive might be grafted into the good olive, and believing Gentiles might be made children of Abraham, \"in Abraham's seed, which is Christ,\"[fn-16-P1626_746335:229-nf] by following the faith of him who, without receiving the law written on tables, and not yet possessing even circumcision, \"believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.\"[fn-16-P1627_746539:230-nf] Now what the apostle attributed to Gentiles of this character,-how that \"they have the work of the law written in their hearts;\"[fn-16-P1628_746699:231-nf] must be some such thing as what he says to the Corinthians: \"not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.\"[fn-16-P1629_746840:232-nf] For thus do they become of the house of Israel, when their uncircumcision is accounted circumcision, by the fact that they do not exhibit the righteousness of the law by the excision of the flesh, but keep it by the charity of the heart. \"If,\" says he, \"the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?\"[fn-16-P1630_747230:233-nf] And therefore in the house of the true Israel, in which is no guile,[fn-16-P1631_747319:234-nf] they are partakers of the new testament, since God puts His laws into their mind, and writes them in their hearts with his own finger, the Holy Ghost, by whom is shed abroad in them the love[fn-16-P1632_747533:235-nf] which is the\" fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-16-P1633_747589:236-nf] ","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":62,"source_paragraph":"191","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Let this discussion suffice, if it satisfactorily meets the question we had to solve.

Let the objector, however, attentively observe that this will is to be ascribed to the divine gift, not merely because it arises from our free will, which was created naturally with us; but also because God acts upon us by the incentives of our perceptions, to will and to believe, either externally by evangelical exhortations, where even the commands of the law also do something, if they so far admonish a man of his infirmity that he betakes himself to the grace that justifies by believing; or internally, where no man has in his own control what shall enter into his thoughts, although it appertains to his own will to consent or to dissent. Since God, therefore, in such ways acts upon the reasonable soul in order that it may believe in Him (and certainly there is no ability whatever in free will to believe, unless there be persuasion or summons towards some one in whom to believe), it surely follows that it is God who both works in man the willing to believe, and in all things prevents us with His mercy. To yield our consent, indeed, to God's summons, or to withhold it, is (as I have said) the function of our own will. And this not only does not invalidate what is said, \"For what hast thou that thou didst not receive?\"[fn-17-P1798_790871:359-nf] but it really confirms it. For the soul cannot receive and possess these gifts, which are here referred to, except by yielding its consent. And thus whatever it possesses, and whatever it receives, is from God; and yet the act of receiving and having belongs, of course, to the receiver and possessor. Now, should any man be for constraining us to examine into this profound mystery, why this person is so persuaded as to yield, and that person is not, there are only two things occurring to me, which I should like to advance as my answer: \"O the depth of the riches!\"[fn-17-P1799_791463:360-nf] and \"Is there unrighteousness with God?\"[fn-18-P1800_791524:361-nf] If the man is displeased with such an answer, he must seek more learned disputants; but let him beware lest he find presumptuous ones.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":68,"source_paragraph":"203","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But let objectors find, if they can, any man, while living under the weight of this corruption, in whom God has no longer anything to forgive; unless nevertheless they acknowledge that such an individual has been aided in the attainment of his good character not merely by the teaching of the law which God gave, but also by the infusion of the Spirit of grace-they will incur the charge of ungodliness itself, not of this or that particular sin. Of course they are not at all able to discover such a man, if they receive in a becoming manner the testimony of the divine writings.

I am quite certain that, as nothing is impossible with God[fn-18-P1862_808758:405-nf] so also there is no iniquity with Him.[fn-18-P1863_808816:406-nf] Equally sure am I that He resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.[fn-18-P1864_808912:407-nf] I know also that to him who had a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should be exalted above measure, it was said, when he besought God for its removal once, twice, nay thrice: \"My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-18-P1865_809219:408-nf] There is, therefore, in the hidden depths of God's judgments, a certain reason why every mouth even of the righteous should be shut in its own praise, and only opened for the praise of God. But what this certain reason is, who can search, who investigate, who know? So \"unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.

Whence the apostle withal judges, and that in a case of fornication,[fn-13-P1328_361909:41-nf] that \"such a man must be surrendered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; \"[fn-13-P1329_362041:42-nf] chiding them likewise because \"brethren\" were not \"judged at the bar of the saints: \"[fn-13-P1330_362145:43-nf] for he goes on and says, \"To what (purpose is it) for me to judge those who are without? \"\"But you remit, in order that remission may be granted you by God.\" The sins which are (thus) cleansed are such as a man may have committed against his brother, not against God. We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

When you think that you have judiciously harmonized the proportions of the hues, and believe yourself to have succeeded in skilfully giving vividness to their mutual combination; presently, when each body (of colour) and (the various) lights are fully developed, the convicted diversity will expose all the error. In the self-same darkness, accordingly, with regard to the parable of the two, sons also, they are led by some figures (occurring in it), which harmonize in hue with the present (state of things), to wander out of the path of the true light of that comparison which the subject-matter of the parable presents. For they set down, as represented in the two sons, two peoples-the eider the Jewish, the younger the Christian: for they cannot in the sequel arrange for the Christian sinner, in the person of the younger son, to obtain pardon, unless in the person of the eider they first portray the Jewish. Now, if I shall succeed in showing that the Jewish fails to suit the comparison of the elder son, the consequence of course will be, that the Christian will not be admissible (as represented) by the joint figure of the younger son. For although the Jew withal be called \"a son,\" and an \"elder one,\" inasmuch as he had priority in adoption;[fn-13-P1398_391415:89-nf] although, too, he envy the Christian the reconciliation of God the Father,-a point which the opposite side most eagerly catches at,-still it will be no speech of a Jew to the Father: \"Behold, in how many years do I serve Thee, and Thy precept have I never transgressed.\" For when has the Jew not been a transgressor of the law; hearing with the ear, and not hearing;[fn-13-P1399_391816:90-nf] holding in hatred him who reproveth in the gates,[fn-14-P1400_391889:91-nf] and in scorn holy speech?[fn-14-P1401_391941:92-nf] So, too, it will be no speech of the Father to the Jew: \"Thou art always with Me, and all Mine are thine.\" For the Jews are pronounced \"apostate sons, begotten indeed and raised on high, but who have not understood the Lord, and who have quite forsaken the Lord, and have provoked unto anger the Holy One of Israel.\"[fn-14-P1402_392284:93-nf] That all things, plainly, were conceded to the Jew, we shall admit; but he has likewise had every more savoury morsel torn from his throat,[fn-14-P1403_392448:94-nf] not to say the very land of paternal promise. And accordingly the Jew at the present day, no less than the younger son, having squandered God's substance, is a beggar in alien territory, serving even until now its princes, that is, the princes of this world.[fn-14-P1404_392768:95-nf] Seek, therefore, the Christians some other as their brother; for the Jew the parable does not admit. Much more aptly would they have matched the Christian with the elder, and the Jew with the younger son, \"according to the analogy of faith,\"[fn-14-P1405_393055:96-nf] if the order of each people as intimated from Rebecca's womb[fn-14-P1406_393140:97-nf] permitted the inversion: only that (in that case) the concluding paragraph would oppose them; for it will he fitting for the Christian to rejoice, and not to grieve, at the restoration of Israel, if it he true, (as it is), that the whole of our hope is intimately united with the remaining expectation of Israel.[fn-14-P1407_393497:98-nf] Thus, even if some (features in the parable) are favourable, yet by others of a contrary significance the thorough carrying out of this comparison is destroyed; although (albeit all points be capable of corresponding with mirror-like accuracy) there he one cardinal danger in interpretations-the danger lest the felicity of our comparisons be tempered with a different aim from that which the subject-matter of each particular parable has bidden us (temper it). For we remember (to have seen) actors withal, white accommodating allegorical gestures to their ditties, giving expression to such as are far different from the immediate plot, and scene, and character, and yet with the utmost congruity. But away with extraordinary ingenuity, for it has nothing to do with our subject. Thus heretics, too, apply the self-same parables where they list, and exclude them (in other cases)-not where they ought-with the utmost aptitude. Why the utmost aptitude? Because from the very beginning they have moulded together the very subject-matters of their doctrines in accordance with the opportune incidences of the parables. Loosed as they are from the constraints of the rule of truth, they have had leisure, of course, to search into and put together those things of which the parables seem (to be symbolical).","title":"VII.

Our Lord himself says,[fn-66-P6613_2070547:23-nf] \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" And in the same place, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" If you reply that this was said before the Passion, we certainly say after the Passion, in the Lord's prayer,[fn-66-P6614_2070948:24-nf] \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\" If we do not sin after baptism, why do we ask that we may be forgiven our sins, which were already forgiven in baptism? Why do we pray that we may not enter into temptation, and that we may be delivered from the evil one, if the devil cannot tempt those who are baptized? The case is different if this prayer belongs to the Catechumens, and is not adapted to faithful Christians. Paul, the chosen vessel,[fn-66-P6615_2071498:25-nf] chastised his body, and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate, and[fn-66-P6616_2071645:26-nf] he tells that there was given to him \"a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet\" him. And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy. But they to whom He says: \"Remember from whence thou art fallen \"; and, \"Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried\"; and, \"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is\"; and, \"Remember how thou hast received, and didst hear, and keep it, and repent,\" and so on, were of course believers, and baptized, who once stood, but fell through sin.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_11_lecture_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"9.

It is not thus that we are taught by the lofty utterance of the Apostle, who says that having made void the law of commandments by His own doctrines, He is the mediator between God and man, declaring it by this saying, \"There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus[fn-11-P1174_635014:171-nf] ;\" where by the distinction implied in the word \"mediator\" he reveals to us the whole aim of the mystery of godliness. Now the aim is this. Humanity once revolted through the malice of the enemy, and, brought into bondage to sin, was also alienated from the true Life. After this the Lord of the creature calls back to Him His own creature, and becomes Man while still remaining God, being both God and Man in the entirety of the two several natures, and thus humanity was indissolubly united to God, the Man that is in Christ conducting the work of mediation, to Whom, by the first-fruits assumed for us, all the lump is potentially united[fn-11-P1175_635681:172-nf] .

But even by the idea of a mediator we are taught the godly doctrine enshrined in the Creed. For the Mediator between God and man entered as it were into fellowship with human nature, not by being merely deemed a man, but having truly become so: in like manner also, being very God, He has not, as Eunomius will have us consider, been honouredby the bare title of Godhead.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":11,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now the drift of Eunomius' excessive concern about the Ungenerate has been often ex plained before; and it shall here be briefly discovered yet again. For as the term Father points to no difference of nature from the Son, his impiety, if he had brought his statement to a close here, would have had no support, seeing that the natural sense of the names Father and Son excludes the idea of their being alien in essence. But as it is, by employing the terms \"generate\" and \"ungenerate,\" since the contradictory opposition between them admits of no mean, just like that between \"mortal\" and \"immortal,\" \"rational\" and \"irrational,\" and all those terms which are opposed to each other by the mutually exclusive nature of their meaning,-by the use of these terms, I repeat, he gives free course to his profanity, so as to contemplate as existing in the \"generate\" with reference to the \"ungenerate\" the same difference which there is between \"mortal\" and \"immortal\": and even as the nature of the mortal is one, and that of the immortal another, and as the special attributes of the rational and of the irrational are essentially incompatible, just so he wants to make out that the nature of the ungenerate is one, and that of the generate another, in order to show that as the irrational nature has been created in subjection to the rational, so the generate is by a necessity of its being in a state of subordination to the ungenerate. For which reason he attaches to the ungenerate the name of \"Almighty,\" and this he does not apply to express providential operation, as the argument led the way for him in suggesting, but transfers the application of the word to arbitrary sovereignty, so as to make the Son to be a part of the subject and subordinate universe, a fellow-slave with all the rest to Him Who with arbitrary and absolute sovereignty controls all alike. And that it is with an eye to this result that he employs these argumentative distinctions, will be clearly established from the passage before us. For after those sapient and carefully-considered expressions, that He is not like either as Father to Father, or as Son to Son,-and yet there is no necessity that father should invariably be like father or son like son: for suppose there is one father among the Ethiopians, and another among the Scythians, and each of these has a son, the Ethiopian's son black, but the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge, yet none the more because each is a father does the Scythian turn black on the Ethiopian's account, nor does the Ethiopian's body change to white on account of the Scythian,-after saying this, however, according to his own fancy, Eunomius subjoins that \"He is like as Son to Father[fn-11-P1182_645287:176-nf] .\" But although such a phrase indicates kinship in nature, as the inspired Scripture attests in the case of Seth and Adam, our doctor, with but small respect for his intelligent readers, introduces his idle exposition of the title \"Son,\" defining Him to be the image and seal of the energy[fn-11-P1183_645670:177-nf] of the Almighty. \"For the Son,\" he says, \"is the image and seal of the energy of the Almighty.\" Let him who hath ears to hear first, I pray, consider this particular point-What is \"the seal of the energy\"? Every energy is contemplated as exertion in the party who exhibits it, and on the completion of his exertion, it has no independent existence. Thus, far example, the energy of the runner is the motion of his feet, and when the motion has stopped there is no longer any energy. So too about every pursuit the same may be said;-when the exertion of him who is busied about anything ceases, the energy ceases also, and has no independent existence, either when a person is actively engaged in the exertion he undertakes, or when he ceases from that exertion. What then does he tell us that the energy is in itself, which is neither essence, nor image, nor person? So he speaks of the Son as the similitude of the impersonal, and that which is like the non-existent surely has itself no existence at all. This is what his juggling with idle opinions comes to,-belief in nonentity! for that which is like nonentity surely itself is not. O Paul and John and all you others of the band of Apostles and Evangelists, who are they that arm their venomous tongues against your words? who are they that raise their frog-like croakings against your heavenly thunder? What then saith the son of thunder? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-11-P1184_647260:178-nf] .\" And what saith he that came after him, that other who had been within the heavenly temple, who in Paradise had been initiated into mysteries unspeakable? \"Being,\" he says, \"the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His person[fn-11-P1185_647522:179-nf] .\" What, after these have thus spoken, are the words of our ventriloquist[fn-11-P1186_647614:180-nf] ? \"The seal,\" quoth he, \"of the energy of the Almighty.\" He makes Him third after the Father, with that non-existent energy mediating between them, or rather moulded at pleasure by non-existence. God the Word, Who was in the beginning, is \"the seal of the energy\":-the Only-begotten God, Who is contemplated in the eternity of the Beginning of existent things, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-11-P1187_648087:181-nf] , Who sustains all things, by the word of His power[fn-11-P1188_648161:182-nf] , the creator of the ages, from Whom and through Whom and in Whom are all things[fn-11-P1189_648264:183-nf] , Who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and hath meted out heaven with the span, Who measureth the water in the hollow of his hand[fn-11-P1190_648423:184-nf] , Who holdeth in His hand all things that are, Who dwelleth on high and looketh upon the things that are lowly[fn-11-P1191_648561:185-nf] , or rather did look upon them to make all the world to be His footstool[fn-11-P1192_648662:186-nf] , imprinted by the footmark of the Word-the form of God[fn-11-P1193_648744:187-nf] is \"the seal\" of an \"energy.\" Is God then an energy, not a Person? Surely Paul when expounding this very truth says He is \"the express image,\" not of His energy, but \"of His Person.\" Is the Brightness of His glory a seal of the energy of God? Alas for his impious ignorance! What is there intermediate between God and His own form? and Whom does the Person employ as mediator with His own express image? and what can be conceived as coming between the glory and its brightness? But while there are such weighty and numerous testimonies wherein the greatness of the Lord of the creation is proclaimed by those who were entrusted with the proclamation of the Gospel, what sort of language does this forerunner of the final apostasy hold concerning Him? What says he? \"As image,\" he says, \"and seal of all the energy and power of the Almighty.\" How does he take upon himself to emend the words of the mighty Paul? Paul says that the Son is \"the Power of God[fn-11-P1194_649722:188-nf] \"; Eunomius calls Him \"the seal of a power,\" not the Power. And then, repeating his expression, what is it that he adds to his previous statement? He calls Him \"seal of the Father's works and words and counsels.\" To what works of the Father is He like? He will say, of course, the world, and all things that are therein. But the Gospel has testified that all these things are the works of the Only-begotten. To what works of theFather, then, was He likened? of what works was He made the seal? what Scripture ever entitled Him \"seal of the Father's works\"? But if any one should grant Eunomius the right to fashion his words at his own will, as he desires, even though Scripture does not agree with him, let him tell us what works of the Father there are of which he says that the Son was made the seal, apart from those that have been wrought by the Son. All things visible and invisible are the work of the Son: in the visible are included the whole world and all that is therein; in the invisible, the supramundane creation. What works of the Father, then, are remaining to be contemplated by themselves, over and above things visible and invisible, whereof he says that the Son was made the \"seal\"? Will he perhaps, when driven into a corner, return once more to the fetid vomit of heresy, and say that the Son is a work of the Father? How then does the Son come to be he seal of these works when He Himself, as Eunomius says, is the work of the Father? Or does he say that the same Person is at once a work and the likeness of a work? Let this be granted: let us suppose him to speak of the other works of which he says the Father was the creator, if indeed he intends us to understand likeness by the term \"seal.\" But what other \"words\" of the Father does Eunomius know, besides that Word Who was ever in the Father, Whom he calls a \"seal\"-Him Who is and is called the Word in the absolute, true, and primary sense? And to what counsels can he possibly refer, apart from the Wisdom of God, to which the Wisdom of God is made like, in becoming a \"seal\" of those counsels? Look at the want of discrimination and circumspection, at the confused muddle of his statement, how he brings the mystery into ridicule, without understanding either what he says or what he is arguing about. For He Who has the Father in His entirety in Himself, and is Himself in His entirety in the Father, as Word and Wisdom and Power and Truth, as His express image and brightness, Himself is all things in the Father, and does not come to be the image and seal and likeness of certain other things discerned in the Father prior to Himself.

The fact that the Divine greatness has no limit is proclaimed by prophecy, which declares expressly that of His splendour, His glory, His holiness, \"there is no end[fn-13-P1399_766983:66-nf] :\" and if His surroundings have no limit, much more is He Himself in His essence, whatever it may be, comprehended by no limitation in any way.

Learning this, therefore, from Paul, we boldly declare that, not only are the judgments of God too high for those who try to search them out, but that the ways also that lead to the knowledge of Him are even until now untrodden and impassable. For this is what we understand that the Apostle wishes to signify, when he calls the ways that lead to the incomprehensible \"past finding out,\" showing by the phrase that that knowledge is unattainable by human calculations, and that no one ever yet set his understanding on such a path of reasoning, or showed any trace or sign of an approach, by way of perception, to the things incomprehensible.","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":11,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"The right will is, therefore, well-directed love, and the wrong will is ill-directed love.

But joy is used in a good sense: \"Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous.\"[fn-23-P2351_1324807:33-nf] And, \"Thou hast put gladness in my heart.\"[fn-23-P2352_1324871:34-nf] And, \"Thou wilt fill me with joy with Thy countenance.\"[fn-23-P2353_1324944:35-nf] Fear is used in a good sense by the apostle when he says, \"Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.\"[fn-23-P2354_1325071:36-nf] And, \"Be not high-minded, but fear.\"[fn-23-P2355_1325128:37-nf] And, \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.\"[fn-23-P2356_1325304:38-nf] But with respect to sadness, which Cicero prefer to calls sickness (oegritudo), and Virgil pain (dolor) (as he says, \"Dolent gaudentque\"[fn-23-P2357_1325460:39-nf] ), but which I prefer to call sorrow, because sickness and pain are more commonly used to express bodily suffering,-with respect to this emotion, I say, the question whether it can be used in a good sense is more difficult.","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_11_vii_the_testament_of_dan_concerning_anger_and_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-08","text":"6.

He is the first-born from the dead, Who first by Himself loosed the pains of death[fn-14-P1478_825316:28-nf] , that He might also make that birth of the resurrection a way for all men[fn-14-P1479_825409:29-nf] . Again, He becomes \"the first-born among many brethren,\" Who is born before us by the new birth of regeneration in water, for the travail whereof the hovering of the Dove was the midwife, whereby He makes those who share with Him in the like birth to be His own brethren, and becomes the first-born of those who after Him are born of water and of the Spirit[fn-14-P1480_825829:30-nf] : and to speak briefly, as there are in us three births, whereby human nature is quickened, one of the body, another in the sacrament of regeneration, another by that resurrection of the dead for which we look, He is first-born in all three:-of the twofold regeneration which is wrought by two (by baptism and by the resurrection), by being Himself the leader in each of them; while it, the flesh He is first-born, as having first and alone devised in His own case that birth unknown to nature, which no one in the many generations of men had originated. If these passages, then, have been rightly understood, neither will the signification of the \"creation,\" of which He is first-born, be unknown to as. For we recognize a twofold creation of our nature, the first that whereby we were made, the second that whereby we were made anew. But there would have been no need of the second creation had we not made the first unavailing by our disobedience. Accordingly, when the first creation had waxed old and vanished away, it was needful that there should be a new creation in Christ, (as the Apostle says, who asserts that we should no longer see in the second creation any trace of that which has waxed old, saying, \"Having put off the old man with his deeds and his lusts, put on the new man which is created according to God[fn-14-P1481_827405:31-nf] ,\" and \"If any man be in Christ,\" he says, \"he is a new creature: the old things are passed away, behold all things are become new[fn-14-P1482_827575:32-nf] :\") -for the maker of human nature at the first and afterwards is one and the same. Then He took dust from the earth and formed man: again, He took dust from the Virgin, and did not merely form man, but formed man about Himself: then, He created; afterwards, He was created: then, the Word made flesh; afterwards, the Word became flesh, that He might change our flesh to spirit, by being made partaker with us in flesh and blood. Of this new creation therefore in Christ, which He Himself began, He was called the first-born, being the first-fruits of all, both of those begotten into life, and of those quickened by resurrection of the dead, \"that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living[fn-14-P1483_828299:33-nf] ,\" and might sanctify the whole lump[fn-14-P1484_828354:34-nf] by means of its first-fruits in Himself. Now that the character of \"first-born\" does not apply to the Son in respect of His pre-temporal existence the appellation of \"Only-begotten\" testifies. For he who is truly only-begotten has no brethren, for bow could any one be only-begotten if numbered among brethren? but as He is called God and man, Son of God and Son of man,-for He has the form of God and the form of a servant[fn-14-P1485_828800:35-nf] , being some things according to His supreme nature, becoming other things in His dispensation of love to man,-so too, being the Only-begotten God, He becomes the first-born of all creation,-the Only-begotten, He that is in the bosom of the Father, yet, among the e who are saved by the new creation, both becoming and being called the first born of the creation. But if, as heresy will have it, He is called first-born because He was made before the rest of the creation, the name does not agree with what they maintain concerning the Only-begotten God. For they do not say this,-that the Son and the universe were from the Father in like manner,-but they say, that the Only-begotten God was made by the Father, and that all else was made by the Only-begotten. Therefore on the same ground on which, while they hold that the Son was created, they call God the Father of the created Being, on the same ground, while they say that all things were made by the Only-begotten God, they give Him the name not of the \"first-born\" of the things that were made by Him, but more properly of their \"Father,\" as the same relation existing in both cases towards the things created, logically gives rise to the same appellation. For if God, Who is over all, is not properly called the \"First-born,\" but the Father of the Being He Himself created, the Only-begotten God will surely also be called, by the same reasoning, the \"father,\" and not properly the \"first-born\" of His own creatures, so that the appellation of \"first-born\" will be altogether improper and superfluous, having no place in the heretical conception,","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":11,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_15_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A. I will requite like with like, and will show that, according to you, the little epistle of the Evangelist contradicts itself. For, if whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not because His seed abideth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God, how is it that the writer says in the same place:[fn-73-P7313_2420103:23-nf] \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\" You cannot explain. You hesitate and are confused. Listen to the same Evangelist telling us that[fn-73-P7314_2420301:24-nf] \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" We are then righteous when we confess that we are sinners, and our righteousness depends not upon our own merits, but on the mercy of God, as the Holy Scripture says,[fn-73-P7315_2420604:25-nf] \"The righteous man accuseth himself when he beginneth to speak,\" and elsewhere,[fn-73-P7316_2420720:26-nf] \"Tell thy sins that thou mayest be justified.\"[fn-73-P7317_2420793:27-nf] \"God hath shut up all under sin, that He may have mercy upon all.\" And the highest righteousness of man is this-whatever virtue he may be able to acquire, not to think it his own, but the gift of God. He then who is born of God does not sin, so long as the seed of God remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. But seeing that, while the householder slept, an enemy sowed tares, and that when we know not, a sower by night scatters in the Lord's field darnel and wild oats among the good corn, this parable of the householder in the Gospel should excite our fears. He cleanses his floor, and gathers the wheat into his garner, but leaves the chaff to be scattered by the winds, or burned by the fire. And so we read in Jeremiah,[fn-73-P7318_2421560:28-nf] \"What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord.\" The chaff, moreover, is separated from the wheat at the end of the world, a proof that, while we are in the mortal body, chaff is mixed with the wheat. But if you object, and ask why did the Apostle say \"and he cannot sin, because he is born of God,\" I reply by asking you what becomes of the reward of his choice? For if a man does not sin because he cannot sin, free will is destroyed, and goodness cannot possibly be due to his efforts, but must be part of a nature unreceptive of evil.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_15_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"134","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A.

As, therefore, he does not say, that God gives to whom He will, but that \"God gives to the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all these graces,\" I could not help being suspicious, when I read such words. For the very name of grace, and the thing that is meant by it, is taken away, if it is not bestowed gratuitously, but he only receives it who is worthy of it. Will anybody say that I do the apostle wrong, because I do not admit him to have been worthy of grace? Nay, I should indeed rather do him wrong, and bring on myself a punishment, if I refused to believe what he himself says. Well, now, has he not pointedly so defined grace as to show that it is so called because it is bestowed gratuitously? These are his own very words: \"And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-30-P3000_1164996:97-nf] In accordance with this, he says again: \"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.\"[fn-30-P3001_1165129:98-nf] Whosoever, therefore, is worthy, to him it is due; and if it is thus due to him, it ceases to be grace; for grace is given, but a debt is paid. Grace, therefore, is given to those who are unworthy, that a debt may be paid to them when they become worthy.

Now that He Who is God over all is also Spirit inseparable from the Father, learn also from that very utterance of the Apostle, of which we are now speaking.

Can He possibly be regarded as of a nature and spirit separable from Himself, He from Whom and through Whom are all things? For all things have come into being through the Son out of nothing, and the Apostle has referred them to God the Father, From Whom are all things, but also to the Son, through Whom are all things. And I find here no difference, since by Each is exercised the same power. For if with regard to the subsistence of the universe it was an exact sufficient statement that things created are from God, what need was there to state that the things which are from God are through Christ, unless it be one and the same thing to be through Christ and from God? But as it has been ascribed to Each of Them that They are Lord and God in such wise that each title belongs to Both, so too from Whom and through Whom is here referred to Both; and this to shew the unity of Both, not to make known God's singleness. The language of the Apostle affords no opening for wicked error, nor is his faith too exalted for careful statement. For he has guarded himself by those specially appropriate words from being understood to mean two Gods or a solitary God: for while he rejects oneness of person he yet does not divide the unity of Godhead. For this from Whom are all things and through Whom are all things, although it did not posit a solitary Deity in the sole possession of majesty, must yet set forth One not different in efficiency, since from Whom are all things and through Whom are all things must signify an Author of the same nature engaged in the same work. He affirms, moreover, that Each is properly of the same nature. For after announcing the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God, and after asserting the mystery of His inscrutable judgments and avowing our ignorance of His ways past finding out, he has yet made use of the exercise of human faith, and rendered this homage to the depth of the unsearchable and inscrutable mysteries of heaven, For of Him and through Him and in Him are all things: to Him be glory for ever.

Augustin replied: You say that the apostle, in leaving Judaism, passed from the bitter to the sweet. But the apostle himself says that the Jews, who would not believe in Christ, were branches broken off, and that the Gentiles, a wild olive tree, were grafted into the good olive, that is, the holy stock of the Hebrews, that they might partake of the fatness of the olive. For, in warning the Gentiles not to be proud on account of the fall of the Jews, he says: \"For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles. I magnify my office; if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches are broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches: but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and weft grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in; and so all Israel shall be saved.\"[fn-13-P1319_699252:1-nf] It appears from this, that you, who do not wish to be graffed into this root, though you are not broken off, like the carnal unbelieving Jews, remain still in the bitterness of the wild olive. Your worship of the sun and moon has the true Gentile flavor. You are none the less in the wild olive of the Gentiles, because you have added thorns of a new kind, and worship along with the sun and moon a false Christ, the fabrication not of your hands, but of your perverse heart. Come, then, and be grafted into the root of the olive tree, in his return to which the apostle rejoices, after by unbelief he had been among the broken branches. He speaks of himself as set free, when he made the happy transition from Judaism to Christianity. For Christ was always preached in the olive tree, and those who did not believe on Him when He came were broken off, while those who believed were grafted in. These are thus warned against pride: \"Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will He spare thee.\" And to prevent despair of those broken off, he adds: \"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou weft cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree.\" The apostle rejoices in being delivered from the condition of a broken branch, and in being restored to the fatness of the olive tree.

Lest, then, he make such a rejoinder, consider, some other words of his on this subject: \"The man,\" says he, \"who hastens to the Lord, and desires to be directed by Him, that is, who makes his own will depend upon God's, who moreover cleaves so closely to the Lord as to become (as the apostle says) 'one spirit' with Him,[fn-33-P3329_1288612:57-nf] does all this by nothing else than by his freedom of will.\" Observe how great a result he has here stated to be accomplished only by our freedom of will; and how, in fact, he supposes us to cleave to God without the help of God: for such is the force of his words, \"by nothing else than by his own freedom of will.\" So that, after we have cleaved to the Lord without His help, we even then, because of such adhesion of our own, deserve to be assisted. [XXIII.] For he goes on to say: \"Whosoever makes a right use of this\" (that is, rightly uses his freedom of will), \"does so entirely surrender himself to God, and does so completely mortify his own will, that he is able to say with the apostle, `Nevertheless it is already of I that live, but Christ liveth in me;'[fn-33-P3330_1289399:58-nf] and `He placeth his heart in the hand of God, so that He turneth it whithersoever He willeth.'\"[fn-33-P3331_1289513:59-nf] Great indeed is the help of the grace of God, so that He turns our heart in whatever direction He pleases. But according to this writer's foolish opinion, however great the help may be, we deserve it all at the moment when, without any assistance beyond the liberty of our will, we hasten to the Lord, desire His guidance and direction, suspend our own will entirely on His, and by close adherence to Him become one spirit with Him. Now all these vast courses of goodness we (according to him) accomplish, forsooth, simply by the freedom of our own free will; and by reason of such antecedent merits we so secure His grace, that He turns our heart which way soever He pleases. Well, now, how is that grace which is not gratuitously conferred? How can it be grace, if it is given in payment of a debt? How can that be true which the apostle says, \"It is not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast;\"[fn-33-P3332_1290473:60-nf] and again, \"If it is of grace, then is it no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace:\"[fn-33-P3333_1290588:61-nf] how, I repeat, can this be true, if such meritorious works precede as to procure for us the bestowal of grace? Surely, under the circumstances, there can be no gratuitous gift, but only the recompense of a due reward. Is it the case, then, that in order to find their way to the help of God, men run to God without God's help? And in order that we may receive God's help while cleaving to Him, do we without His help cleave to God? What greater gift, or even what similar gift, could grace itself bestow upon any man, if he has already without grace been able to make himself one spirit with the Lord by no other power than that of his own free will?","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But what is added, \"And it shall come to pass that he who is left in thine house shall come to worship him,\" is not said properly of the house of this Eli, but of that Aaron, the men of which remained even to the advent of Jesus Christ, of which race there are not wanting men even to this present.

With respect to the Holy Spirit, however, there has not been as yet, on the part of learned and distinguished investigators of the Scriptures, a discussion of the subject full enough or careful enough to make it possible for us to obtain an intelligent conception of what also constitutes His special individuality (proprium): in virtue of which special individuality it comes to be the case that we cannot call Him either the Son or the Father, but only the Holy Spirit; excepting that they predicate Him to be the Gift of God, so that we may believe God not to give a gift inferior to Himself. At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without beginning (ne duo constituamus principia isne principio), which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain heretics.[fn-32-P3275_1506357:92-nf] Some, however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead (deitatem), which the Greeks designate qeotha, is the Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each other,-to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by cleaving to the Father,[fn-32-P3276_1506799:93-nf] -should [thereby] be constituted equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other, they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which says, \"For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,\"[fn-32-P3277_1507383:94-nf] or many other proofs texts of a similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the express fact that it is through the Holy Spirit that we are reconciled unto God; whence also, when He is called the Gift of God, they will have it that sufficient indication is offered of the love of God and the Holy Spirit being identical. For we are not reconciled unto Him except through that love in virtue of which we are also called sons:[fn-32-P3278_1507839:95-nf] as we are no more \"under fear, like servants,\"[fn-32-P3279_1507954:96-nf] because \"love, when it is made perfect, casteth out fear;\"[fn-32-P3280_1508033:97-nf] and [as] \"we have received the spirit of liberty, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-32-P3281_1508134:98-nf] And inasmuch as, being reconciled and called back into friendship through love, we shall be able to become acquainted with all the secret things of God, for this reason it is said of the Holy Spirit that \"He shall lead you into all truth.\"[fn-32-P3282_1508394:99-nf] For the same reason also, that confidence in preaching the truth, with which the apostles were filled at His advent,[fn-32-P3283_1508531:100-nf] is rightly ascribed to love; because diffidence also is assigned to fear, which the perfecting of love excludes. Thus, likewise, the same is called the Gift of God,[fn-32-P3284_1508715:101-nf] because no one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to the same in love (ei dilectione cohaerere). Neither does any one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (Spiritus Sanctus), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned (sanciuntur)[fn-32-P3285_1509135:102-nf] are sanctioned with a view to their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity (sanctitatem) is derived from sanction (a sanciendo). Above all, however, that testimony is employed by the upholders of this opinion, where it is thus written, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;\"[fn-32-P3286_1509634:103-nf] \"for God is a Spirit.\"[fn-32-P3287_1509677:104-nf] For here He speaks of our regeneration,[fn-32-P3288_1509737:105-nf] which is not, according to Adam, of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit, when it is said, \"For God is a Spirit,\" they maintain that we must take note that it is not said, \"for the Spirit is God,\"[fn-32-P3289_1510223:106-nf] but, \"for God is a Spirit;\" so that the very Godhead of the Father and the Son is in this passage called God, and that is the Holy Spirit. To this is added another testimony which the Apostle John offers, when he says, \"For God is love.\"[fn-32-P3290_1510571:107-nf] For here, in like manner, what he says is not, \"Love is God,\"[fn-32-P3291_1510655:108-nf] but, \"God is love;\" so that the very Godhead is taken to be love. And with respect to the circumstance that, in that enumeration of mutually connected objects which is given when it is said, \"All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's,\"[fn-32-P3292_1511009:109-nf] as also, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God,\"[fn-32-P3293_1511143:110-nf] there is no mention of the Holy Spirit; this they affirm to be but an application of the principle that, in general, the connection itself is not wont to be enumerated among the things which are connected with each other. Whence, also, those who read with closer attention appear to recognize the express Trinity likewise in that passage in which it is said, \"For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things.\"[fn-32-P3294_1511582:111-nf] \"Of Him,\" as if it meant, of that One who owes it to no one that He is: \"through Him,\" as if the idea were, through a Mediator; \"in Him,\" as if it were, in that One who holds together, that is, unites by connecting.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"349","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Off-broken boughs![fn-37-P3745_705140:52-nf] should into parts divide","title":"5.

Now that the words addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and Father, of Whom are all things[fn-20-P2094_1268713:8-nf] .\" Accordingly human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of foresight[fn-20-P2095_1269055:9-nf] , imports a certain relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father's image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, \"by nature were no Gods[fn-20-P2096_1269960:10-nf] ,\" and in the place of the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, \"The partridge called, she gathered together what she hatched not[fn-20-P2097_1270174:11-nf] .\" Since, then, this was the sum of our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature[fn-20-P2098_1270575:12-nf] . For human nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us[fn-20-P2099_1271124:13-nf] , and frees us from the curse by taking on Him our curse as His own[fn-21-P2100_1271215:14-nf] , and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle, \"slain\" in Himself \"the enmity[fn-21-P2101_1271328:15-nf] \" which by means of sin had come between us and God,-(in fact sin was \"the enmity\")-and having become what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God[fn-21-P2102_1271640:16-nf] , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-21-P2103_1271716:17-nf] , He drew with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day become disciples of the Word,-the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is hallowed[fn-21-P2104_1272237:18-nf] . \"For behold,\" He says, \"I and the children whom God hath given Me[fn-21-P2105_1272327:19-nf] .\" He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin[fn-21-P2106_1272542:20-nf] . And so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ's Humanity is a common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also \"shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air[fn-21-P2107_1273219:21-nf] ,\" even so, when we hear that the true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt hat we shall come to the same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner[fn-21-P2108_1273533:22-nf] . And the fact too that this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we have given For since, as the Apostle tells us, \"the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression[fn-21-P2109_1273771:23-nf] ,\" and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering[fn-21-P2110_1274235:24-nf] to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":11,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"48. If any one, however, asserts that if this was the real state of the case, Mark might have mentioned the third hour explicitly at the point at which it really was the third hour, namely, when the voices of the Jews were lifted up demanding that the Lord should be crucified; and, further, that he might have told us plainly there that those vociferators did really crucify Him at that time,-such a reasoner is simply imposing laws upon the historians of truth in his own overweening pride. For he might as well maintain that if he were himself to be a narrator of these occurrences, they ought all to be recorded just in the same way and the same order by all other writers as they have been recorded by himself. Let him therefore be content to reckon his own notion inferior to that of Mark the evangelist, who has judged it right to insert the statement just at the point at which it was suggested to him by divine inspiration. For the recollections of those historians have been ruled by the hand of Him who rules the waters, as it is written, according to His own good pleasure.

The words are his; and after premising them, he propounded his question, by way of showing us the very rocks against which he struck and waswrecked. For to such lengths was he carried, and against such frightful reefs was he borne, drifted, and struck, that his escape was a perfect impossibility without a retreat-a correction, in short, of what he had said; since he was unable to show by what desert the soul was made sinful; though he was not afraid to say, that previous to any sin of its own it had deserved to become sinful. Now, who deserves, without committing any sin, so immense a punishment as to be conceived in the sin of another, before leaving his mother's womb, and then to be no longer free from sin? But from this punishment the free grace of God delivers the souls of such infants as are regenerated in Christ, with no previous merits of their own-\"otherwise grace is no grace.\"[fn-44-P4478_1703868:3-nf] With regard, then, to this person, who is so vastly intelligent, and who in the great depth of his wisdom is displeased at our hesitation, which, if not well informed, is at all events circumspect, let him tell us, if he can, what the merit was which brought the soul into such a punishment, from which grace delivers it without any merit. Let him speak, and, if he can, defend his assertion with some show of reason. I would not, indeed, require so much of him, if he had not himself declared that the soul deserved to become sinful. Let him tell us what the desert was-whether good desert or evil? If good, how could well-deserving lead to evil? If evil, whence could arise any ill desert previous to the commission of any sin? I have also to remark, that if there be a good desert, then the liberation of the soul would not be of free grace, but it would be due to the previous merit, and thus \"grace would be no more grace.\" If there be, however, an evil desert, then I ask what it is. Is it true that the soul has come into the flesh; and that it would not have so come unless He in whom there is no sin had Himself sent it? Never, therefore, except by floundering worse and worse, will he contrive to set up this view of his, in which he predicates of the soul that it deserved to be sinful. In the case of those infants, too, in whose baptism original sin is washed away, he found something to say after a fashion,-to the effect, that being involved in the sin of another could not possibly have been detrimental to them, predestinated as they were to eternal life in the foreknowledge of God. This might admit of a tolerably good sense, if he had not entangled himself in that formula of his, in which he asserts that the soul deserved to be sinful: from this difficulty he can only extricate himself by revoking his words, with regret at having expressed them.

At the same time, we do not hesitate to affirm, that the proposition which he advances, that the soul comes to man neither out of descent nor out of nothing, is certainly not true: this, I say, we affirm to be without doubt not true.

If, indeed, our human bodies are not of God, then that is false which the Scripture says: \"For of Him are all things, through Him are all things, and in Him are all things.\"[fn-45-P4566_1746493:37-nf] Again, with reference to the same apostle's statement, \"For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman,\"[fn-45-P4567_1746633:38-nf] let him explain to us what propagation he would choose to be meant in the process,-that of the soul, or of the body, or of both? But he will not allow that souls come by propagation: it remains, therefore, that, according to him and all who deny the propagation of souls, the apostle signified the masculine and feminine body only, when he said, \"As the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman;\" the woman having been made out of the man, in order that the man might afterwards, by the process of birth, come out of the woman. If, therefore, the apostle, when he said this, did not intend the soul and spirit also to be understood, but only the bodies of the two sexes, why does he immediately add, \"But all things are of God,\"[fn-45-P4568_1747395:39-nf] unless it be that bodies also are of God? For so runs his entire statement: \"As the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman; but all things are of God.\" Let, then, our disputant determine of what this is said. If of men's bodies, then, of course, even bodies are of God. How comes it to pass, therefore, that whenever this person reads in Scripture the phrase, \"of God,\" when man is in question, he will have the words understood, not in reference to men's bodies, but only as concerning their souls and spirits? But if the expression, \"All things are of God,\" was spoken both of the body of the two sexes, and of their soul and spirit, it follows that in all things the woman is of the man, for the woman comes from the man, and the man is by the woman: but all things of God. What \"all things\" are meant, except those he was speaking of, namely, the man of whom came the woman, and the woman who was of the man, and also the man who came by the woman? For that man came not by woman, out of whom came the woman; but only he who afterwards was born of man by woman, just as men are now born. Hence it follows that if the apostle, when he said the words we have quoted from him, spoke of men's bodies, undoubtedly the bodies of persons of both sexes are of God. Furthermore, if he insists that nothing in man comes from God except their souls and spirits, then, of course, the woman is of the man even as regards her soul and spirit; so that nothing is left to those who dispute against the propagation of souls. But if he is for dividing the subject in such a manner as to say that the woman is of the man as regards her body, but is of God in respect of her soul and spirit, how, then, will that be true which the apostle says, \"All things of God,\" if the woman's body is of the man in such a sense that it is not of God? Wherefore, allowing that the apostle is more likely to speak the truth than that this person must be preferred as an authority to the apostle, the woman is of the man, whether in regard to her body only, or in reference to the entire whole of which human nature consists (but we assert nothing on these points as an absolute certainty, but are still inquiring after their truth); and the man is through the woman, whether it be that his whole nature as man is derived to him from his father, and is born in him through the woman, or the flesh alone; about which points the question is still undecided. \"All things, however, are of God,\" and about this there is no question; and in this phrase are included the body, soul, and spirit, both of the man and the woman. For even if they were not born or derived from God, or emanated from Him as portions of His nature, yet they are of God, inasmuch as whatever is created, formed, and made by Him, has from Him the reality of its existence.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_32_book_i","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"5.

Because he would not have added the attribute \"sinful,\"[fn-78-P7838_2233365:652-nf] if he meant the \"likeness\" to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case he would only have used the word \"flesh,\" and omitted the \"sinful.\" But inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said \"sinful flesh,\" (or \"flesh of sin,\")[fn-78-P7839_2234360:653-nf] he has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose[fn-78-P7840_2234533:654-nf] that the likeness was predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition[fn-78-P7841_2234765:655-nf] with our own; but true still, as being of a nature[fn-78-P7842_2234831:656-nf] not really unlike ours.[fn-78-P7843_2235083:657-nf] And again, in contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness. The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he would not have us \"live in the flesh,\" although in the flesh-even by not living in the works of the flesh[fn-78-P7846_2236549:660-nf] -he shows that when he wrote the words, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-78-P7847_2236670:661-nf] it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,[fn-78-P7848_2236925:662-nf] not on the substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if \"the body indeed is dead because of sin\" (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the body), \"but the spirit is life because of righteousness,\"[fn-78-P7849_2237246:663-nf] it follows that this life accrues to that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the body[fn-78-P7850_2237401:664-nf] is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: \"He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\"[fn-78-P7851_2237664:665-nf] In these words he both affirmed the resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called[fn-78-P7852_2237793:666-nf] body, nor can anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God.

But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the Father \"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-78-P7832_2232206:646-nf] it must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom.

Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness. The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he would not have us \"live in the flesh,\" although in the flesh-even by not living in the works of the flesh[fn-78-P7846_2236549:660-nf] -he shows that when he wrote the words, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-78-P7847_2236670:661-nf] it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,[fn-78-P7848_2236925:662-nf] not on the substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if \"the body indeed is dead because of sin\" (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the body), \"but the spirit is life because of righteousness,\"[fn-78-P7849_2237246:663-nf] it follows that this life accrues to that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the body[fn-78-P7850_2237401:664-nf] is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: \"He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\"[fn-78-P7851_2237664:665-nf] In these words he both affirmed the resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called[fn-78-P7852_2237793:666-nf] body, nor can anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God.

Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law.

But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the Father \"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-78-P7832_2232206:646-nf] it must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom.

I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God. So says the Creator's Psalmist: \"It is better to hope in the Lord, than to hope even in princes.\"[fn-78-P7870_2243623:684-nf] \"Patient in tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7871_2243671:685-nf] You have (this in) the Psalm: \"The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7872_2243770:686-nf] \"Bless, and curse not,\"[fn-78-P7873_2243812:687-nf] (says your apostle.) But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things, and blessed them? \"Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\"[fn-78-P7874_2244046:688-nf] For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces a woe.[fn-78-P7875_2244123:689-nf] \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\"[fn-78-P7876_2244180:690-nf] (Like unto which is the Creator's precept: ) \"Thou shalt not remember thy brother's evil against thee.\"[fn-78-P7877_2244305:691-nf] (Again: ) \"Avenge not yourselves; \"[fn-78-P7878_2244366:692-nf] for it is written, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"[fn-78-P7879_2244457:693-nf] \"Live peaceably with all men.\"[fn-78-P7880_2244538:694-nf] The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense. Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion's god (after all).[fn-78-P7882_2245034:696-nf] If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator's Christ, what is the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it? \"[fn-78-P7883_2245389:697-nf] In vain has (our man of) Pontus laboured to deny this statement.[fn-78-P7884_2245474:698-nf] If the gospel has not fulfilled the law, then all I can say is,[fn-78-P7885_2245698:699-nf] the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"17. And this circumstance would assist rather than hinder the understanding of Scripture, if only readers were not careless. For the examination of a number of texts has often thrown light upon some of the more obscure passages; for example, in that passage of the prophet Isaiah,[fn-48-P4872_2636056:17-nf] one translator reads: \"And do not despise the domestics of thy seed;\"[fn-48-P4873_2636209:18-nf] another reads: \"And do not despise thine own flesh.\"[fn-48-P4874_2636308:19-nf] Each of these in turn confirms the other. For the one is explained by the other; because \"flesh\" may be taken in its literal sense, so that a man may understand that he is admonished not to despise his own body; and \"the domestics of thy seed\" may be understood figuratively of Christians, because they are spiritually born of the same seed as ourselves, namely, the Word. When now the meaning of the two translators is compared, a more likely sense of the words suggests itself, viz., that the command is not to despise our kinsmen, because when one brings the expression \"domestics of thy seed\" into relation with \"flesh,\" kinsmen most naturally occur to one's mind. Whence, I think, that expression of the apostle, when he says, \"If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them;\"[fn-48-P4875_2637175:20-nf] that is, that through emulation of those who had believed, some of them might believe too. And he calls the Jews his \"flesh,\" on account of the relationship of blood. Again, that passage from the same prophet Isaiah:[fn-48-P4876_2637410:21-nf] \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand,\"[fn-48-P4877_2637550:22-nf] another has translated: \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.\"[fn-48-P4878_2637663:23-nf] Now which of these is the literal translation cannot be ascertained without reference to the text in the original tongue. And yet to those who read with knowledge, a great truth is to be found in each. For it is difficult for interpreters to differ so widely as not to touch at some point. Accordingly here, as understanding consists in sight, and is abiding, but faith feeds us as babes, upon milk, in the cradles of temporal things (for now we walk by faith, not by sight);[fn-48-P4879_2638182:24-nf] as, moreover, unless we walk by faith, we shall not attain to sight, which does not pass away, but abides, our understanding being purified by holding to the truth;-for these reasons one says,\" If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand;\" but the other, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.\"","title":"Book II","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"313","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Isaiah: \"Thus saith the Lord God, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is the stool of my feet.

They are different sayings, \"Whither shall I go away from Thy Spirit, and from Thy face whither shall I flee?\"[fn-40-P4035_1913235:124-nf] and, \"One thing I have sought of the Lord, this I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord through all the days of my life, that I may consider the delight of the Lord, that I be protected in His temple:\"[fn-40-P4036_1913480:125-nf] and, \"Turn not away Thy face from me:\"[fn-40-P4037_1913540:126-nf] and, \"My soul longeth and fainteth unto the courts of the Lord.[fn-40-P4038_1913625:127-nf] Those sayings let him have had, who dared not to lift up his eyes to heaven; and she who was watering with tears His feet, in order to obtain pardon for her grievous sins; but these do thou have, who art careful about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit.

Remember then, that Jechonias, rejected without any fault of his, ceased to reign, and passed over unto the Gentiles, when the carrying away unto Babylon took place. Now observe the figure hereby manifested beforehand, of things to come in the Lord Jesus Christ. For the Jews would not that our Lord Jesus Christ should reign over them, yet found they no fault in Him. He was rejected in His own person, and in that of His servants also, and so they passed over unto the Gentiles as into Babylon in a figure. For this also did Jeremiah prophesy, that the Lord commanded them to go into Babylon: and whatever other prophets told the people not to go into Babylon, them he reproved as false prophets.[fn-29-P2944_1302934:37-nf] Let those who read the Scriptures, remember this as we do; and let those who do not, give us credit. Jeremiah then on the part of God threatened those who would not go into Babylon, whereas to them who should go he promised rest there, and a sort of happiness in the cultivation of their vines, and planting of their gardens, and the abundance of their fruits. How then does the people of Israel, not now in figure but in verity, pass over unto Babylon? Whence came the Apostles? Were they not of the nation of the Jews? Whence came Paul himself?for he saith, \"I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.\"[fn-29-P2945_1303587:38-nf] Many of the Jews then believed in the Lord; from them were the Apostles chosen; of them were the more than five hundred brethren, to whom it was vouchsafed[fn-29-P2946_1303760:39-nf] to see the Lord after His resurrection;[fn-29-P2947_1303816:40-nf] of them were the hundred and twenty in the house,[fn-29-P2948_1303885:41-nf] when the Holy Ghost came down. But what saith the Apostle in the Acts of the Apostles, when the Jews refused the word of truth? \"We were sent unto you, but seeing ye have rejected the word of God, lo! we turn unto the Gentiles.\"[fn-29-P2949_1304131:42-nf] The true passing over then into Babylon, which was then prefigured in the time of Jeremiah, took place in the spiritual dispensation of the time of the Lord's Incarnation. But what saith Jeremiah of these Babylonians, to those who were passing over to them? \"For in their peace shall be your peace.\"[fn-29-P2950_1304451:43-nf] When Israel then passed over also into Babylon by Christ and the Apostles, that is, when the Gospel came unto the Gentiles, what saith the Apostle, as though by the mouth of Jeremiah of old? \"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men. For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.\"[fn-29-P2951_1304904:44-nf] For they were not yet Christian kings, yet he prayed for them. Israel then praying in Babylon hath been heard; the prayers of the Church have been heard, and the kings have become Christian, and you see now fulfilled what was then spoken in figure; \"In their peace shall be your peace,\" for they have received the peace of Christ, and have left off to persecute Christians, that now in the secure quiet of peace, the Churches might be built up, and peoples planted in the garden[fn-29-P2952_1305405:45-nf] of God, and that all nations might bring forth fruit in faith, and hope, and love, which is in Christ.","title":"Sermon I.

For this is proved by Jeremiah when he says, \"God hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by His understanding.\"[fn-87-P8770_2445851:471-nf] These are the energies by the stress of which He made this universe.[fn-87-P8771_2445940:472-nf] His glory is greater if He laboured. At length on the seventh day He rested from His works. Both one and the other were after His manner. If, on the contrary,[fn-87-P8772_2446119:473-nf] He made this world simply by appearing and approaching it, did He, on the completion of His work, cease to appear and approach it any more. Nay rather,[fn-87-P8773_2446286:474-nf] God began to appear more conspicuously and to be everywhere accessible[fn-87-P8774_2446372:475-nf] from the time when the world was made. You see, therefore, how all things consist by the operation of that God who \"made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heaven by His understanding; \"not appearing merely, nor approaching, but applying the almighty efforts of His mind, His wisdom, His power, His understanding, His word, His Spirit, His might. Now these things were not necessary to Him, if He had been perfect by simply appearing and approaching. They are, however, His \"invisible things,\" which, according to the apostle, \"are from the creation of the world clearly seen by the things that are made;[fn-87-P8775_2447054:476-nf] they are no parts of a nondescript[fn-87-P8776_2447108:477-nf] Matter, but they are the sensible[fn-87-P8777_2447162:478-nf] evidences of Himself. \"For who hath known the mind of the Lord,\"[fn-87-P8778_2447245:479-nf] of which (the apostle) exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches both of His wisdom and knowledge! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! \"[fn-87-P8779_2447428:480-nf] Now what clearer truth do these words indicate, than that all things were made out of nothing? They are incapable of being found out or investigated, except by God alone. Otherwise, if they were traceable or discoverable in Matter, they would be capable of investigation. Therefore, in as far as it has become evident that Matter had no prior existence (even from this circumstance, that it is impossible[fn-87-P8780_2447849:481-nf] for it to have had such an existence as is assigned to it), in so far is it proved that all things were made by God out of nothing. It must be admitted, however,[fn-87-P8781_2448032:482-nf] that Hermogenes, by describing for Matter a condition like his own-irregular, confused, turbulent, of a doubtful and precipate and fervid impulse-has displayed a specimen of his own art, and painted his own portrait.

Augustin replied: You often speak in your discourses of two gods, as indeed you acknowledge, though at first you denied it. And you give as a reason for thus speaking the words of the apostle: \"The god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not.\" Most of us punctuate this sentence differently, and explain it as meaning that the true God has blinded the minds of unbelievers. They put a stop after the word God, and read the following words together. Or without this punctuation you may, for the sake of exposition, change the order of the words, and read, \"In whom God has blinded the minds of unbelievers of this world,\" which gives the same sense. The act of blinding the minds of unbelievers may in one sense be ascribed to God, as the effect not of malice, but of justice. Thus Paul himself says elsewhere, \"Is God unjust, who taketh vengeance?\"[fn-19-P1975_1149563:2-nf] and again, \"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For Moses saith, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\" Observe what he adds, after asserting the undeniable truth that there is no unrighteousness with God: \"But what if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, and that He might manifest the riches of His grace towards the vessels of mercy, which He hath before prepared unto glory?\"[fn-19-P1976_1150160:3-nf] etc. Here it evidently cannot be said that it is one God who shows his wrath, and makes known his power in the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, and another God who shows his riches in the vessels of mercy. According to the apostle's doctrine, it is one and the same God who does both. Hence he says again, \"For this cause God gave them up to the lusts of their own heart, to uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves;\" and immediately after, \"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;\" and again, \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.\"[fn-19-P1977_1150830:4-nf] Here we see how the true and just God blinds the minds of unbelievers. For in all these words quoted from the apostle no other God is understood than He whose Son, sent by Him, came saying, \"For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind.\"[fn-19-P1978_1151165:5-nf] Here, again, it is plain to the minds of believers how God blinds the minds of unbelievers. For among the secret things, which contain the righteous principles of God's judgment, there is a secret which determines that the minds of some shall be blinded, and the minds of some enlightened. Regarding this, it is well said of God, \"Thy judgments are a great deep.\"[fn-19-P1979_1151545:6-nf] The apostle, in admiration of the unfathomable depth of this abyss, exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!

Thus you assign to God the bestowal of blessings, and take from Him the infliction of judgments, as if He of whom Christ says that He has prepared everlasting fire for the wicked were a different being from Him who makes His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. Why do you not understand that this great goodness and great severity belong to one God, but because you have not learned to sing of mercy and judgment? Is not He who causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust, the same who also breaks off the natural branches, and engrafts contrary to nature the wild olive tree?

It is a profound mystery, impenetrable by human thought, how God both condemns the ungodly and justifies the ungodly; for both these things are said of Him in the truth of the Holy Scriptures. But is the mysteriousness of the divine judgments any reason for taking pleasure in cavilling against them? How much more becoming, and more suitable to the limitation of our powers, to feel the same awe which the apostle felt, and to exclaim, \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!

Thus the Egyptians deserved the punishment, and the Israelites were suitably employed in inflicting it. Perhaps, indeed, it was not so much a command as a permission to the Hebrews to act in the matter according to their own inclinations; and God, in sending the message by Moses, only wished that they should thus be informed of His permission. There may also have been mysterious reasons for what God said to the people on this matter. At any rate, God's commands are to be submissively received, not to be argued against.

For by doing good works thou hadst as it were the \"breadth,\" by persevering in them thou hadst as it were the \"length;\" but by seeking earthly things thou hast not had the \"height.\" Now observe the \"depth;\" it is the grace of God in the secret dispensation of His will. \"For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor?\"[fn-32-P3221_1414928:48-nf] and, \"Thy judgments are as a great depth.\"[fn-32-P3222_1414989:49-nf] ","title":"Sermon III.

His compassion for us compelled Him, who cannot be compelled, to be born in a human body at Bethlehem. But what necessity was there that He, when a suckling infant,[fn-60-P6032_1842735:24-nf] that He who, though both in time, was not limited by time, that He, who though wrapped in swaddling clothes, was not by them held fast, what necessity was there that He should be an exile and a stranger from His country? Should you, forsooth, wish to know this, ye congregation most holy, and upon whom the Spirit of God hath breathed, listen to Moses proclaiming plainly to the people, stimulating them, as it were, to the knowledge of this extraordinary nativity, and saying, \"Every male that openeth the womb, shall be called holy to the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6033_1843941:25-nf] O wondrous circumstance! \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\"[fn-60-P6034_1844056:26-nf] It became indeed the Lord of the law and the prophets to do all things in accordance with His own law, and not to make void the law, but to fulfil it, and rather to connect with the fulfilment of the law the beginning of His grace. Therefore it is that the mother, who was superior to the law, submits to the law. And she, the holy and undefiled one, observes that time of forty days that was appointed for the unclean. And He who makes us free from the law, became subject to the law; and there is offered for Him, who hath sanctified us, a pair of clean birds,[fn-60-P6035_1844637:27-nf] in testimony of those who approach clean and blameless. Now that that parturition was polluted, and stood not in need of expiatory victims, Isaiah is our witness, who proclaims distinctly to the whole earth under the sun: \"Before she travailed,\" he says, \"she brought forth before her pains came, she escaped, and brought forth a man-child.\"[fn-60-P6036_1844997:28-nf] Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? The must holy virgin mother, therefore, escaped entirely the manner of women even before she brought forth: doubtless, in order that the Holy Spirit, betrothing her unto Himself, and sanctifying her, she might conceive without intercourse with man. She hath brought forth her first-born Son, even the only-begotten Son of God, Him, I say, who in the heavens above shone forth as the only-begotten, without mother, froth out His Father's substance, and preserved the virginity of His natural unity undivided and inseparable; and who on earth, in the virgin's nuptial chamber, joined to Himself the nature of Adam, like a bridegroom, by an inalienable union, and preserved His mother's purity uncorrupt and un injured-Him, in short, who in heaven was begotten without corruption, and on earth brought forth in a manner quite unspeakable.

For how has the Lord commanded us to pray for those who persecute us? Do we pray thus that the grace of God may be recompensed them for the sake of their good will, and not rather that the evil will itself may be changed into a good one? Just as we believe that at that time the saints whom he was persecuting did not pray for Saul in vain, that his will might be converted to the faith which he was destroying. And indeed that his conversion was effected from above, appeared even by a manifest miracle. But how many enemies of Christ are at the present day suddenly drawn by God's secret grace to Christ! And if I had not set down this word from the gospel, what things would that man have said in this behalf concerning me, since even now he is stirring, not against me, but against Him who cries, \"No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him\"![fn-52-P5218_2046306:82-nf] For He does not say, \"except He lead him,\" so that we can thus in any way understand that his will precedes.

But against the Pelagians also, not without reason, we pronounce an anathema, for that they are so hostile to God's grace, which comes through Jesus Christ our Lord, as to say that it is given not freely, but according to our merits, and thus grace is no more grace;[fn-52-P5246_2054893:95-nf] and place so much in free will by which man is plunged into the abyss, as to say that by making good use of it man deserves grace,-although no man can make good use of it except by grace, which is not repaid according to debt, but is given freely by God's mercy. And they so contend that infants are already saved, that they dare deny that they are to be saved by the Saviour. And holding and disseminating these execrable dogmas, they still over and above constantly demand a hearing, when, as condemned, they ought to repent.

We now come to consider the next point in the work before us, How the Word was with God. To this end it will be of service to remember that what is called the Word came to certain persons; as \"The Word of the Lord[fn-64-P6424_1047093:1-nf] which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri,\" and \"The Word[fn-64-P6425_1047161:2-nf] which came to Isaiah, the son of Amos, concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem,\" and \"The Word which came to Jeremiah[fn-64-P6426_1047296:3-nf] concerning the drought.\" We must enquire how this Word came to Hosea, and how it came also to Isaiah the son of Amos, and again to Jeremiah concerning the drought; the comparison may enable us to dud out how the Word was with God. The generality will simply look at what the prophets said, as if that were the Word of the Lord or the Word, that came to them. May it not be, however, that as we say that this person comes to that, so the Son, the Word, of whom we are now theologizing, came to Hosea, sent to him by the Father; historically, that is to say, to the son of Beeri, the prophet Hosea, but mystically to him who is saved, for Hosea means, etymologically, Saved; and to the son of Beeri, which etymologically means wells, since every one who is saved becomes a son of that spring which gushes forth out of the depths, the wisdom of God. And it is nowise marvellous that the saint should be a son of wells. From his brave deeds he is often called a son, whether, from his works shining before men, of light, or from his possessing the peace of God which passes all understanding, of peace, or, once more, from the help which wisdom brings him, a child of wisdom; for wisdom,[fn-64-P6427_1048496:4-nf] it says, is justified of her children. Thus he who by the divine spirit searches all things, and even the deep things of God, so that he can exclaim,[fn-64-P6428_1048663:5-nf] \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!\" he can be a son of wells, to whom the Word of the Lord comes. Similarly the Word comes also to Isaiah, teaching the things which are coming upon Judaea and Jerusalem in the last days; and so also it comes to Jeremiah lifted up by a divine elation. For Iao means etymologically lifting up, elation. Now the Word comes to men who formerly could not receive the advent of the Son of God who is the Word; but to God it does not come, as if it had not been with Him before. The Word was always with the Father; and so it is said, \"And the Word was with God.\" He did not come to God, and this same word \"was\" is used of the Word because He was in the beginning at the same time when He was with God, neither being separated from the beginning nor being bereft of His Father. And again, neither did He come to be in the beginning after He had not been in it, nor did He come to be with God after not having been with Him. For before all time and the remotest age[fn-64-P6429_1049708:6-nf] the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God. Thus to find out what is meant by the phrase, \"The Word was with God,\" we have adduced the words used about the prophets, how He came to Hosea, to Isaiah, to Jeremiah, and we have noticed the difference, by no means accidental, between \"became\" and \"was.\" We have to add that in His coming to the prophets He illuminates the prophets with the light of knowledge, causing them to see things which had been before them, but which they had not understood till then. With God, however, He is God, just because He is with Him. And perhaps it was because he saw some such order in the Logos, that John did not place the clause \"The Word was God\" before the clause \"The Word was with God.\" The series in which he places his different sentences does not prevent the force of each axiom from being separately and fully seen. One axiom is, \"In the beginning was the Word,\" a second, \"The Word was with God,\" and then comes, \"And the Word was God.\" The arrangement of the sentences might be thought to indicate an order; we have first \"In the beginning was the Word,\" then, \"And the Word was with God,\" and thirdly, \"And the Word was God,\" so that it might be seen that the Word being with God makes Him God.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_32_on_infants_early_deaths","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For my part, in view of the difficulties of the subject proposed, I think the exclamation of the Apostle very suitable to the present case, just as he uttered it over unfathomable questions: \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!

I assert, too, that it is not well at once to confront and meet objections, as if we were pleading in court, but to introduce a certain order into the discussion and to lead the view on from one point to another. What, then, should this order be? First, we want to know the whence of human nature, and the wherefore of its ever having come into existence. If we hit the answer to these questions, we shall not fail in getting the required explanation. Now, that everything that exists, after God, in the intellectual or sensible world of beings owes that existence to Him, is a proposition which it is superfluous to prove; no one, with however little insight into the truth of things, would gainsay it. For every one agrees that the Universe is linked to one First Cause; that nothing in it owes its existence to itself, so as to be its own origin and cause; but that there is on the other hand a single uncreate eternal Essence, the same for ever, which transcends all our ideas of distance, conceived of as without increase or decrease, and beyond the scope of any definition; and that time and space with all their consequences, and anything previous to these that thought can grasp in the intelligible supramundane world, are all the productions of this Essence. Well, then, we affirm that human nature is one of these productions; and a word of the inspired Teaching helps us in this, which declares that when God had brought all things else upon the scene of life, man was exhibited upon the earth, a mixture from Divine sources, the godlike intellectual essence being in him united with the several portions of earthly elements contributed towards his formation, and that he was fashioned by his Maker to be the incarnate likeness of Divine transcendent Power. It would be better however to quote the very words: \"And God created man, in the image of God created He him[fn-29-P2930_1973672:15-nf] .\" Now the reason of the making of this animate being has been given by certain writers previous to us as follows. The whole creation is divided into two parts; that \"which is seen,\" and that \"which is not seen,\" to use the Apostle's words (the second meaning the intelligible and immaterial, the first, the sensible and material); and being thus divided, the angelic and spiritual natures, which are among \"the things not seen,\" reside in places above the world, and above the heavens, because such a residence is in correspondence with their constitution; for an intellectual nature is a fine, clear, unencumbered, agile kind of thing, and a heavenly body is fine and light, and perpetually moving, and the earth on the contrary, which stands last in the list of things sensible, can never be an adequate and congenial spot for creatures intellectual to sojourn in. For what correspondence can there possibly be between that which is light and buoyant, on the one hand, and that which is heavy and gravitating on the other? Well, in order that the earth may not be completely devoid of the local indwelling of the intellectual and the immaterial, man (these writers tell us) was fashioned by the Supreme forethought, and his earthy parts moulded over the intellectual and godlike essence of his soul; and so this amalgamation with that which has material weight enables the soul to live on this element of earth, which possesses a certain bond of kindred with the substance of the flesh. The design of all that is being born[fn-29-P2931_1975216:16-nf] , then, is that the Power which is above both the heavenly and the earthly universe may in all parts of the creation be glorified by means of intellectual natures, conspiring to the same end by virtue of the same faculty in operation in all, I mean that of looking upon God. But this operation of looking upon God is nothing less than the life-nourishment appropriate, as like to like, to an intellectual nature. For just as these bodies, earthy as they are, are preserved by nourishment that is earthy, and we detect in them all alike, whether brute or reasoning, the operations of a material kind of vitality, so it is right to assume that there is an intellectual life-nourishment as well, by which such natures[fn-29-P2932_1976033:17-nf] are maintained in existence. But if bodily food, coming and going as it does in circulation, nevertheless imparts a certain amount of vital energy to those who get it, how much more does the partaking of the real thing, always remaining and always the same, preserve the eater in existence? If, then, this is the life-nourishment of an intellectual nature, namely, to have a part in God, this part will not be gained by that which is of an opposite quality; the would-be partaker must? some degree be akin to that which is to be partaken of. The eye enjoys the light by virtue of having light within itself to seize its kindred light, and the finger or any other limb cannot effect the act of vision because none of this natural light is organized in any of them. The same necessity requires that in our partaking of God there should be some kinship in the constitution of the partaker with that which is partaken of. Therefore, as the Scripture says, man was made in the image of God; that like, I take it, might be able to see like; and to see God is, as was said above, the life of the soul. But seeing that ignorance of the true good is like a mist that obscures the visual keenness of the soul, and that when that mist grows denser a cloud is formed so thick that Truth's ray cannot pierce through these depths of ignorance, it follows further that with the total deprivation of the light the soul's life ceases altogether; for we have said that the real life of the soul is acted out in partaking of the Good; but when ignorance hinders this apprehension of God, the soul which thus ceases to partake of God, ceases also to live. But no one can force us to give the family history[fn-29-P2933_1978013:18-nf] of this ignorance, asking whence and from what father it is; let him be given to understand from the word itself that \"ignorance\" and \"knowledge\" indicate one of the relations of the soul;[fn-29-P2934_1978220:19-nf] but no relation, whether expressed or not, conveys the idea of substance; a relation and a substance are quite of different descriptions. If, then, knowledge is not a substance, but a perfected[fn-29-P2935_1978452:20-nf] operation of the soul, it must be conceded that ignorance must be much farther removed still from anything in the way of substance; but that which is not in that way does not exist at all; and so it would be useless to trouble ourselves about where it comes from. Now seeing that the Word[fn-29-P2936_1978836:21-nf] declares that the living in God is the life of the soul, and seeing that this living is knowledge according to each man's ability, and that ignorance does not imply the reality of anything, but is only the negation of the operation of knowing, and seeing that upon this partaking in God being no longer effected there follows at once the cancelling of the soul's life, which is the worst of evils,-because of all this the Producer of all Good would work in us the cure of such an evil. A cure is a good thing, but one who does not look to the evangelic mystery would still be ignorant of the manner of the cure. We have shown that alienation from God, Who is the Life, is an evil; the cure, then, of this infirmity is, again to be made friends with God, and so to be in life once more. When such a life, then, is always held up in hope before humanity, it cannot be said that the winning of this life is absolutely a reward of a good life, and that the contrary is a punishment (of a bad one); but what we insist on resembles the case of the eyes. We do not say that one who has clear eyesight is rewarded as with a prize by being able to perceive the objects of sight; nor on the other hand that he who has diseased eyes experiences a failure of optic activity as the result of some penal sentence. With the eye in a natural state sight follows necessarily; with it vitiated by disease failure of sight as necessarily follows. In the same way the life of blessedness is as a familiar second nature to those who have kept clear the senses of the soul; but when the blinding stream of ignorance prevents our partaking in the real light, then it necessarily follows that we miss that, the enjoyment of which we declare to be the life of the partaker.","title":"On Infants' Early Deaths","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":11,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_32_on_infants_early_deaths","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For my part, in view of the difficulties of the subject proposed, I think the exclamation of the Apostle very suitable to the present case, just as he uttered it over unfathomable questions: \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!

Whether, then, the early deaths of infants are to be attributed to the aforesaid causes, or whether there is some further cause of them beyond these, it befits us to acknowledge that these things happen for the best. I have another reason also to give which I have learnt from the wisdom of an Apostle; a reason, that is, why some of those who have been distinguished for their wickedness have been suffered to live on in their self-chosen course. Having expanded a thought of this kind at some length in his argument to the Romans[fn-29-P2965_2003630:46-nf] , and having retorted upon himself with the counter-conclusion, which thence necessarily follows, that the sinner could no longer be justly blamed, if his sinning is a dispensation of God, and that he would not have existed at all, if it had been contrary to the wishes of Him Who has the world in His power, the Apostle meets this conclusion and solves this counter-plea by means of a still deeper view of things. He tells us that God, in rendering to every one his due, sometimes even grants a scope to wickedness for good in the end. Therefore He allowed the King of Egypt, for example, to be born and to grow up such as he was; the intention was that Israel, that great nation exceeding all calculation by numbers, might be instructed by his disaster. God's omnipotence is to be recognized in every direction; it has strength to bless the deserving; it is not inadequate to the punishment of wickedness[fn-29-P2966_2004613:47-nf] ; and so, as the complete removal of that peculiar people out of Egypt was necessary in order to prevent their receiving any infection from the sins of Egypt in a misguided way of living, therefore that God-defying and infamous Pharaoh rose and reached his maturity in the lifetime of the very people who were to be benefited, so that Israel might acquire a just knowledge of the two-fold energy of God, working as it did in either direction; the more beneficent they learnt in their own persons, the sterner by seeing it exercised upon those who were being scourged for their wickedness; for in His consummate wisdom God can mould even evil into co-operation with good. The artisan (if the Apostle's argument may be confirmed by any words of ours)-the artisan who by his skill has to fashion iron to some instrument for daily use, has need not only of that which owing to its natural ductility lends itself to his art, but, be the iron never so hard, be it never so difficult to soften it in the fire, be it even impossible owing to its adamantine resistance to mould it into any useful implement, his art requires the co-operation even of this; he will use it for an anvil, upon which the soft workable iron may be beaten and formed into something useful. But some one will say, \"It is not all who thus reap in this life the fruits of their wickedness, any more than all those whose lives have been virtuous profit while living by their virtuous endeavours; what then, I ask, is the advantage of their existence in the case of these who live to the end unpunished?\" I will bring forward to meet this question of yours a reason which transcends all human arguments. Somewhere in his utterances the great David declares that some portion of the blessedness of the virtuous will consist in this; in contemplating side by side with their own felicity the perdition of the reprobate. He says, \"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the ungodly[fn-29-P2967_2006721:48-nf] \"; not indeed as rejoicing over the torments of those sufferers, but as then most completely realizing the extent of the well-earned rewards of virtue. He signifies by those words that it will be an addition to the felicity of the virtuous and an intensification of it, to have its contrary set against it. In saying that \"he washes his hands in the blood of the ungodly\" he would convey the thought that \"the cleanness of his own acting in life is plainly declared in the perdition of the ungodly.\" For the expression \"wash\" represents the idea of cleanness; but no one is washed, but is rather defiled, in blood; whereby it is clear that it is a comparison with the harsher forms of punishment that puts in a clearer light the blessedness of virtue. We must now summarize our argument, in order that the thoughts which we have expanded may be more easily retained in the memory. The premature deaths of infants have nothing in them to suggest the thought that one who so terminates his life is subject to some grievous misfortune, any more than they are to be put on a level with the deaths of those who have purified themselves in this life by every kind of virtue; the more far-seeing Providence of God curtails the immensity of sins in the case of those whose lives are going to be so evil. That some of the wicked have lived on[fn-29-P2968_2008075:49-nf] does not upset this reason which we have rendered; for the evil was in their case hindered in kindness to their parents; whereas, in the case of those whose parents have never imparted to them any power of calling upon God, such a form of the Divine kindness[fn-29-P2969_2008410:50-nf] , which accompanies such a power, is not transmitted to their own children; otherwise the infant now prevented by death from growing up wicked would have exhibited a far more desperate wickedness than the most notorious sinners, seeing that it would have been unhindered. Even granting that some have climbed to the topmost pinnacle of crime, the Apostolic view supplies a comforting answer to the question; for He Who does everything with Wisdom knows how to effect by means of evil some good. Still further, if some occupy a pre-eminence in crime, and yet for all that have never been a metal, to use our former illustration, that God's skill has used for any good, this is a case which constitutes an addition to the happiness of the good, as the Prophet's words suggest; it may be reckoned as not a slight element in that happiness, nor, on the other hand, as one unworthy of God's providing.

Having expanded a thought of this kind at some length in his argument to the Romans[fn-29-P2965_2003630:46-nf] , and having retorted upon himself with the counter-conclusion, which thence necessarily follows, that the sinner could no longer be justly blamed, if his sinning is a dispensation of God, and that he would not have existed at all, if it had been contrary to the wishes of Him Who has the world in His power, the Apostle meets this conclusion and solves this counter-plea by means of a still deeper view of things. He tells us that God, in rendering to every one his due, sometimes even grants a scope to wickedness for good in the end. Therefore He allowed the King of Egypt, for example, to be born and to grow up such as he was; the intention was that Israel, that great nation exceeding all calculation by numbers, might be instructed by his disaster. God's omnipotence is to be recognized in every direction; it has strength to bless the deserving; it is not inadequate to the punishment of wickedness[fn-29-P2966_2004613:47-nf] ; and so, as the complete removal of that peculiar people out of Egypt was necessary in order to prevent their receiving any infection from the sins of Egypt in a misguided way of living, therefore that God-defying and infamous Pharaoh rose and reached his maturity in the lifetime of the very people who were to be benefited, so that Israel might acquire a just knowledge of the two-fold energy of God, working as it did in either direction; the more beneficent they learnt in their own persons, the sterner by seeing it exercised upon those who were being scourged for their wickedness; for in His consummate wisdom God can mould even evil into co-operation with good. The artisan (if the Apostle's argument may be confirmed by any words of ours)-the artisan who by his skill has to fashion iron to some instrument for daily use, has need not only of that which owing to its natural ductility lends itself to his art, but, be the iron never so hard, be it never so difficult to soften it in the fire, be it even impossible owing to its adamantine resistance to mould it into any useful implement, his art requires the co-operation even of this; he will use it for an anvil, upon which the soft workable iron may be beaten and formed into something useful. But some one will say, \"It is not all who thus reap in this life the fruits of their wickedness, any more than all those whose lives have been virtuous profit while living by their virtuous endeavours; what then, I ask, is the advantage of their existence in the case of these who live to the end unpunished?\" I will bring forward to meet this question of yours a reason which transcends all human arguments. Somewhere in his utterances the great David declares that some portion of the blessedness of the virtuous will consist in this; in contemplating side by side with their own felicity the perdition of the reprobate. He says, \"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the ungodly[fn-29-P2967_2006721:48-nf] \"; not indeed as rejoicing over the torments of those sufferers, but as then most completely realizing the extent of the well-earned rewards of virtue. He signifies by those words that it will be an addition to the felicity of the virtuous and an intensification of it, to have its contrary set against it. In saying that \"he washes his hands in the blood of the ungodly\" he would convey the thought that \"the cleanness of his own acting in life is plainly declared in the perdition of the ungodly.\" For the expression \"wash\" represents the idea of cleanness; but no one is washed, but is rather defiled, in blood; whereby it is clear that it is a comparison with the harsher forms of punishment that puts in a clearer light the blessedness of virtue. We must now summarize our argument, in order that the thoughts which we have expanded may be more easily retained in the memory. The premature deaths of infants have nothing in them to suggest the thought that one who so terminates his life is subject to some grievous misfortune, any more than they are to be put on a level with the deaths of those who have purified themselves in this life by every kind of virtue; the more far-seeing Providence of God curtails the immensity of sins in the case of those whose lives are going to be so evil. That some of the wicked have lived on[fn-29-P2968_2008075:49-nf] does not upset this reason which we have rendered; for the evil was in their case hindered in kindness to their parents; whereas, in the case of those whose parents have never imparted to them any power of calling upon God, such a form of the Divine kindness[fn-29-P2969_2008410:50-nf] , which accompanies such a power, is not transmitted to their own children; otherwise the infant now prevented by death from growing up wicked would have exhibited a far more desperate wickedness than the most notorious sinners, seeing that it would have been unhindered. Even granting that some have climbed to the topmost pinnacle of crime, the Apostolic view supplies a comforting answer to the question; for He Who does everything with Wisdom knows how to effect by means of evil some good. Still further, if some occupy a pre-eminence in crime, and yet for all that have never been a metal, to use our former illustration, that God's skill has used for any good, this is a case which constitutes an addition to the happiness of the good, as the Prophet's words suggest; it may be reckoned as not a slight element in that happiness, nor, on the other hand, as one unworthy of God's providing.

Hath not the potter power of the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour \"[fn-53-P5322_2092551:26-nf] Then, following on, he opened up this great and hidden secret as far as he judged it fit that it should be disclosed to men, saying, \"But if God, willing to show His wrath and to demonstrate His power, endured in much patience the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, even that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for glory.\"[fn-53-P5323_2092953:27-nf] This is notonly the assistance, but, moreover, the proof of God's grace-the assistance, namely, in thevessels of mercy, but the proof in the vessels of wrath; for in these He shows His anger andmakes known His power, because His goodnessis so mighty that He even uses the evil well; andin those He makes known the riches of Hisglory on the vessels of mercy, because what thejustice of a punisher requires from the vessels ofwrath, the grace of the Deliverer remits to the i vessels of mercy. Nor would the kindnesswhich is bestowed on some freely appear, unless I to other equally guilty and from the same massGod showed what was really due to both, andcondemned them with a righteous judgment.\"For who maketh thee to differ?\"[fn-53-P5324_2093702:28-nf] says the same apostle to a man as it were boasting concerning himself and his own benefits. \"For who maketh thee to differ\" from the vessels of wrath; of course, from the mass of perdition which has sent all by one into damnation? \"Who maketh thee to differ?\" And as if he had answered, \"My faith maketh me to differ,-my purpose, my merit,\"-he says, \"For what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast as if thou receivedst it not?\"-that is, as if that by which thou art made to differ were of thine own. Therefore He maketh thee to differ who bestows that whence thou art made to differ, by removing the penalty that is due, by conferring the grace which is not due. He maketh to differ, who, when the darkness was upon the face of the abyss, said,\" Let there be light; and there was light, and divided\"-that is, made to differ-\"between the light and the darkness.\"[fn-53-P5325_2094635:29-nf] For when there was only darkness, He did not find what He should make to differ; but by making the light, He made to differ; so that it may be said to the justified wicked, \"For ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-53-P5326_2094891:30-nf] And thus he who glories must glory not in himself, but in the Lord.

But if by grace, then is itno more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-47-P4787_2358854:46-nf] This is election of grace; that is, election in which through the grace of God men are elected: this, I say, is election of grace which goes before all good merits of men. For if it be to any good merits that it is given, then is it no more gratuitously given, but is paid as a debt, and consequently is not truly called grace; where \"reward,\" as the same Apostle saith, \"is not imputed as grace, but as debt.\"[fn-47-P4788_2359285:47-nf] Whereas if, that it may be true grace, that is, gratuitous, it find nothing inman to which it is due of merit, (which thing is well understood in that saying, \"Thou wiltsave them for nothing,\"[fn-47-P4789_2359495:48-nf] ) then assuredly itself gives the merits, not to merits is given. Consequently it goes before even faith, from which it is that all good works begin. \"For the just,\" as is written, \"shall live by faith.\"[fn-47-P4790_2359822:49-nf] But, moreover, grace not only assists the just, but also justifies the ungodly. And therefore even when it does aid the just and seems to be rendered to his merits, not even then does it cease to be grace, because that which it aids it did itself bestow. With a view therefore to this grace, which precedes all good merits of man, not only was Christ put to death by the ungodly, but \"died for the ungodly.\"[fn-47-P4791_2360249:50-nf] And ere that He died, He elected the Apostles, not of course then just, but to be justified: to whom He saith, \"I have chosen you out of the world.\" For to whom He said, \"Ye are not of the world,\" and then, lest they should account themselves never to have been of the world, presently added, \"But I have chosen you out of the world;\" assuredly that they should not be of the world was by His own election of them conferred upon them. Wherefore, if it had been through their own righteousness, not through His grace, that they were elected, they would not have been chosen out of the world, because they would already not be of the world if already they were just. And again, if the reason why they were elected was, that they were already just, they had already first chosen the Lord. For who can be righteous but by choosing righteousness? \"But the end of the law is Christ, for righteousness is to every one that believeth.[fn-47-P4792_2361192:51-nf] Who is made unto us wisdom of God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-47-P4793_2361368:52-nf] He then is Himself our righteousness.","title":"On Patience","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"14.

Augustin replied: As to Enoch and Elias and Moses, our belief is determined not by Faustus' suppositions, but by the declarations of Scripture, resting as they do on foundations of the strongest and surest evidence. People in error, as you are, are unfit to decide what is natural, and what contrary to nature. We admit that what is contrary to the ordinary course of human experience is commonly spoken of as contrary to nature. Thus the apostle uses the words, \"If thou art cut out of the wild olive, and engrafted contrary to nature in the good olive.\"[fn-23-P2376_1439395:2-nf] Contrary to nature is here used in the sense of contrary to human experience of the course of nature; as that a wild olive engrafted in a good olive should bring forth the fatness of the olive instead of wild berries. But God, the Author and Creator of all natures, does nothing contrary to nature; for whatever is done by Him who appoints all natural order and measure and proportion must be natural in every case. And man himself acts contrary to nature only when he sins; and then by punishment he is brought back to nature again. The natural order of justice requires either that sin should not be committed or that it should not go unpunished. In either case, the natural order is preserved, if not by the soul, at least by God. For sin pains the conscience, and brings grief on the mind of the sinner, by the loss of the light of justice, even should no physical sufferings follow, which are inflicted for correction, or are reserved for the incorrigible. There is, however, no impropriety in saying that God does a thing contrary to nature, when it is contrary to what we know of nature. For we give the name nature to the usual common course of nature; and whatever God does contrary to this, we call a prodigy, or a miracle. But against the supreme law of nature, which is beyond the knowledge both of the ungodly and of weak believers, God never acts, any more than He acts against Himself. As regards spiritual and rational beings, to which class the human soul belongs, the more they partake of this unchangeable law and light, the more clearly they see what is possible, and what impossible; and again, the greater their distance from it, the less their perception of the future, and the more frequent their surprise at strange occurrences.","title":"Book XXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_39_book_iv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But wherefore does God make these men sheep, and those not, since with Him there is no acceptance of persons? This is the very question which the blessed apostle thus answers to those who propose it with more curiosity than propriety, \"O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Does the thing formed say to him that formed it, Wherefore hast thou made me thus?\"[fn-56-P5669_2225876:55-nf] This is the very question which belongs to that depth desiring to look into which the same apostle was in a certain measure terrified, and exclaimed, \"Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been His counsellor? Or who has first given to Him, that it should be recompensed to Him again? Because of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things: to Him be glory for ages of ages.\"[fn-56-P5670_2226422:56-nf] Let them not, then, dare to pry into that unsearchable question who defend merit before grace, and therefore even against grace, and wish first to give unto God, that it may be given to them again,-first, of course, to give something of free will, that grace may be given them again as a reward; and let them wisely understand or faithfully believe that even what they think that they have first given, they have received from Him, from whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things. But why this man should receive, and that should not receive, when neither of them deserves to receive, and whichever of them receives, receives undeserv-ingly,-let them measure their own strength, and not search into things too strong for them. Let it suffice them to know that there is no un-righteousness with God. For when the apostle could find no merits for which Jacob should take precedence of his twin-brother with God, he said, \"What, then, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? Away with the thought! For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion. Therefore it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.\"[fn-56-P5671_2227697:57-nf] Let, therefore, His free compassion be grateful to us, even although this profound question be still unsolved; which, nevertheless, is so far solved as the same apostle solves it, saying, \"But if God, willing to show His wrath, and to demonstrate His power, endured in much patience the vessels of wrath which are fitted to destruction; and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He has prepared for glory.\"[fn-56-P5672_2228167:58-nf] Certainly wrath is not repaid unless it is due, lest there be unrighteousness with God; but mercy, even when it is bestowed, and not due, is not unrighteousness with God. And hence, let the vessels of mercy understand how freely mercy is afforded to them, because to the vessels of wrath with whom they have common cause and measure of perdition, is repaid wrath, righteous and due. This is now enough in opposition to those who, by freedom of will, desire to destroy the liberality of grace.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":34,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But this very declaration of His they will hastily pervert into an argument of His singleness. \"I have,\" says He, \"stretched out the heaven alone.\" Undoubtedly alone as regards all other powers; and He thus gives a premonitory evidence against the conjectures of the heretics, who maintain that the world was constructed by various angels and powers, who also make the Creator Himself to have been either an angel or some subordinate agent sent to form external things, such as the constituent parts of the world, but who was at the same time ignorant of the divine purpose. If, now, it is in this sense that He stretches out the heavens alone, how is it that these heretics assume their position so perversely, as to render inadmissible the singleness of that Wisdom which says, \"When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him? \"[fn-106-P10657_2995058:223-nf] -even though the apostle asks, \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-106-P10658_2995185:224-nf] meaning, of course, to except that wisdom which was present with Him.[fn-106-P10659_2995275:225-nf] In Him, at any rate, and with Him, did (Wisdom) construct the universe, He not being ignorant of what she was making. \"Except Wisdom,\" however, is a phrase of the same sense exactly as \"except the Son,\" who is Christ, \"the Wisdom and Power of God,\"[fn-106-P10660_2995547:226-nf] according to the apostle, who only knows the mind of the Father. \"For who knoweth the things that be in God, except the Spirit which is in Him? \"[fn-106-P10661_2995714:227-nf] Not, observe, without Him. There was therefore One who caused God to be not alone, except \"alone\" from all other gods. But (if we are to follow the heretics), the Gospel itself will have to be rejected, because it tells us that all things were made by God through the Word, without whom nothing was made.[fn-106-P10662_2996040:228-nf] And if I am not mistaken, there is also another passage in which it is written: \"By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hosts of them by His Spirit.\"[fn-106-P10663_2996228:229-nf] Now this Word, the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, must be the very Son of God. So that, if (He did) all things by the Son, He must have stretched out the heavens by the Son, and so not have stretched them out alone, except in the sense in which He is \"alone\" (and apart) from all other gods. Accordingly He says, concerning the Son, immediately afterwards: \"Who else is it that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad, turning wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish, and confirming the words[fn-106-P10664_2996783:230-nf] of His Son? \"[fn-106-P10665_2996819:231-nf] -as, for instance, when He said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-106-P10666_2996986:232-nf] By thus attaching the Son to Himself, He becomes His own interpreter in what sense He stretched out the heavens alone, meaning alone with His Son, even as He is one with His Son. The utterance, therefore, will be in like manner the Son's, \"I have stretched out the heavens alone,\"[fn-106-P10667_2997289:233-nf] because by the Word were the heavens established.[fn-106-P10668_2997361:234-nf] Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when Wisdom was present in the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because He alone ministered to the Father's work. It must also be He who says, \"I am the First, and to all futurity I AM.\"[fn-106-P10669_2997707:235-nf] The Word, no doubt, was before all things. \"In the beginning was the Word; \"[fn-106-P10670_2997811:236-nf] and in that beginning He was sent forth[fn-106-P10671_2997869:237-nf] by the Father. The Father, however, has no beginning, as proceeding from none; nor can He be seen, since He was not begotten. He who has always been alone could never have had order or rank. Therefore, if they have determined that the Father and the Son must be regarded as one and the same, for the express purpose of vindicating the unity of God, that unity of His is preserved intact; for He is one, and yet He has a Son, who is equally with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures. Since they are unwilling to allow that the Son is a distinct Person, second from the Father, lest, being thus second, He should cause two Gods to be spoken of, we have shown above[fn-106-P10672_2998556:238-nf] that Two are actually described in Scripture as God and Lord. And to prevent their being offended at this fact, we give a reason why they are not said to be two Gods and two Lords, but that they are two as Father and Son; and this not by severance of their substance, but from the dispensation wherein we declare the Son to be undivided and inseparable from the Father,-distinct in degree, not in state. And although, when named apart, He is called God, He does not thereby constitute two Gods, but one; and that from the very circumstance that He is entitled to be called God, from His union with the Father.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And hence there arises no small question, which must be solved by the Lord's gift.

This ought to be the fixed and immoveable conviction of your heart, that there is no unrighteousness with God. Therefore, whenever you read in the Scriptures of Truth, that men are led aside, or that their hearts are blunted and hardened by God, never doubt that some ill deserts of their own have first occurred, so that they justly suffer these things.

But, moreover, it is not less marvellous, and still true, and so manifest that not even the enemies of God's grace can find any means of denying it, that some children of His friends, that is, of regenerated and good believers, departing this life as infants without baptism,although He certainly might provide the grace of this laver if He willed, since in His power are all things,-He alienates from His kingdom into which He introduces their parents; and some children of His enemies He causes to come into the hands of Christians, and by means of this laver introduces into the kingdom, from which their parents are aliens; although, as well to the former infants there is no evil deserving, as to the latter there is no good, of their own proper will.

This might moreover be the word of the Apostle Peter, because he also had said in his abundance, \"I will lay down my life for Thy sake;\"[fn-64-P6494_2480493:102-nf] attributing to himself, in his eagerness, what was afterwards to be bestowed on him by his Lord.

The aid without which a thing does not come to pass is one thing, and the aid by which a thing comes to pass is another. For without food we cannot live; and yet although food should be at hand, it would not cause a man to live who should will to die. Therefore the aid of food is that without which it does not come to pass that we live, not that by which it comes to pass that we live. But, indeed, when the blessedness which a man has not is given him, he becomes at once blessed. For the aid is not only that without which that does not happen, but also with which that does happen for the sake of which it is given. Wherefore this is an assistance both by which it comes to pass, and without which it does not come to pass; because, on the one hand, if blessedness should be given to a man, he becomes at once blessed; and, on the other, if it should never be given he will never be so. But food does not of necessity cause a man to live, and yet without it he cannot live. Therefore to the first man, who, in that good in which he had been made upright, had received the ability not to sin, the ability not to die, the ability not to forsake that good itself, was given the aid of perseverance,-not that by which it should be brought about that he should persevere, but that without which he could not of free will persevere. But now to the saints predestinated to the kingdom of God by God's grace, the aid of perseverance that is given is not such as the former, but such that to them perseverance itself is bestowed; not only so that without that gift they cannot persevere, but, moreover, so that by means of this gift they cannot help persevering. For not only did He say, \"Without me ye can do nothing,\"[fn-65-P6543_2501473:121-nf] but He also said, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.\"[fn-65-P6544_2501651:122-nf] By which words He showed that He had given them not only righteousness, but perseverance therein. For when Christ thus ordained them that they should go and bring forth fruit, and that their fruit should remain, who would dare to say, It shall not remain? Who would dare to say, Perchance it will not remain? \"For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;\"[fn-65-P6545_2502040:123-nf] but the calling is of those who are called according to the purpose.

If this had happened to none of these, men would have that very wholesome fear, by which the sin of presumption is kept down, only so long as until they should attain to the grace of Christ by which to live piously, and afterwards would for time to come be secure that they would never fall away from Him. And such presumption in this condition of trials is not fitting, where there is so great weakness, that security may engender pride. Finally, this also shall be the case; but it shall be at that time, in men also as it already is in the angels, when there cannot be any pride.

Oh the proof of cruelty, which has slain for this reason, that he whom it may have slain may not die! And therefore what follows? Wisdom is praised in hymns, in the places of egress; for the death of martyrs also is praised in song. Wisdom behaves with firmness in the streets, for with good results does she murder her own sons.[fn-110-P11024_3112947:44-nf] Nay, on the top of the walls she speaks with assurance, when indeed, according to Esaias, this one calls out, \"I am God's; \"and this one shouts, \"In the name of Jacob; \"and another writes, \"In the name of Israel.\"[fn-110-P11025_3113211:45-nf] O good mother!

And if thou hast received it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received it?\"[fn-66-P6697_2549667:22-nf] And it was chiefly by this testimony that I myself also was convinced when I was in a similar error, thinking that faith whereby we believe on God is not God's gift, but that it is in us from ourselves, and that by it we obtain the gifts of God, whereby we may live temperately and righteously and piously in this world. For I did not think that faith was preceded by God's grace, so that by its means would be given to us what we might profitably ask, except that we could not believe if the proclamation of the truth did not precede; but that we should consent when the gospel was preached to us I thought was our own doing, and came to us from ourselves. And this my error is sufficiently indicated in some small works of mine written before my episcopate. Among these is that which you have mentioned in your letters[fn-66-P6698_2550507:23-nf] wherein is an exposition of certain propositions from the Epistle to the Romans. Eventually, when I was retracting all my small works, and was committing that retractation to writing,of which task I had already completed two books before I had taken up your more lengthy letters,-when in the first volume I had reached the retractation of this book, I then spoke thus:-\"Also discussing, I say, `what God could have chosen in him who was as yet unborn, whom He said that the elder should serve; and what in the same elder, equally as yet unborn, He could have rejected; concerning whom, on this account, the prophetic testimony is recorded, although declared long subsequently, \"Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,\"'[fn-66-P6699_2551301:24-nf] I carried out my reasoning to the point of saying: `God did not therefore choose the works of any one in foreknowledge of what He Himself would give them, but he chose the faith, in the foreknowledge that He would choose that very person whom He foreknew would believe on Him,-to whom He would give the Holy Spirit, so that by doing good works he might obtain eternal life also.' I had not yet very carefully sought, nor had I as yet found, what is the nature of the election of grace, of which the apostle says, `A remnant are saved according to the election of grace.'[fn-67-P6700_2551909:25-nf] Which assuredly is not grace if any merits precede it; lest what is now given, not according to grace, but according to debt, be rather paid to merits than freely given. And what I next subjoined: `For the same apostle says, \"The same God which worketh all in all;\"[fn-67-P6701_2552192:26-nf] but it was never said, God believeth all in all;' and then added, `Therefore what we believe is our own, but what good thing we do is of Him who giveth the Holy Spirit to them that believe:' I certainly could not have said, had I already known that faith itself also is found among those gifts of God which are given by the same Spirit. Both, therefore, are ours on account of the choice of the will, and yet both are given by the spirit of faith and love, For faith is not alone but as it is written, `Love with faith, from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.'[fn-67-P6702_2552781:27-nf] And what I said a little after, `For it is ours to believe and to will, but it is His to give to those who believe and will, the power of doing good works through the Holy Spirit, by whom love is shed abroad in our hearts,'-is true indeed; but by the same rule both are also God's, because God prepares the will; and both are ours too, because they are only brought about with our good wills. And thus what I subsequently said also: `Because we are not able to will unless we are called; and when, after our calling, we would will, our willing is not sufficiently nor our running, unless God gives strength to us that run, and leads us whither He calls us;' and thereupon added:' It is plain, therefore, that it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy, that we do good works'-this is absolutely most true. But I discovered little concerning the calling itself, which is according to God's purpose; for not such is the calling of all that are called, but only of the elect. Therefore what I said a little afterwards: `For as in those whom God elects it is not works but faith that begins the merit so as to do good works by the gift of God, so in those whom He condemns, unbelief and impiety begin the merit of punishment, so that even by way of punishment itself they do evil works'-I spoke most truly. But that even the merit itself of faith was God's gift, I neither thought of inquiring into, nor did I say. And in another place I say: `For whom He has mercy upon, He makes to do good works, and whom He hardeneth He leaves to do evil works; but that mercy is bestowed upon the preceding merit of faith, and that hardening is applied to preceding iniquity.' And this indeed is true; but it should further have been asked, whether even the merit of faith does not come from God's mercy,-that is, whether that mercy is manifested in man only because he is a believer, or whether it is also manifested that he may be a believer? For we read in the apostles words: `I obtained mercy to be a believer.'[fn-67-P6703_2554843:28-nf] He does not say, `Because I was a believer.' Therefore although it is given to the believer, yet it has been given also that he may be a believer. Therefore also, in another place in the same book I most truly said: `Because, if it is of God's mercy, and not of works, that we are even called that we may believe and it is granted to us who believe to do good works, that mercy must not be grudged to the heathen;'-although I there discoursed less carefully about that calling which is given according to God's purpose.\"[fn-67-P6704_2555385:29-nf] ","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\" Many hear the word of truth; but some believe, while others contradict.

For when he had said, \"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in yourselves, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel should be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Sion one who shall deliver, and turn away impiety from Jacob: and this is the covenant to them from me, when I shall take away their sins;\"[fn-68-P6857_2620641:104-nf] he immediately added, what is to be very carefully understood, \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes: but as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sake.\"[fn-68-P6858_2620869:105-nf] What is the meaning of, \"as concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake,\" but that their enmity wherewith they put Christ to death was, without doubt, as we see, an advantage to the gospel? And he shows that this came about by God's ordering, who knew how to make a good use even of evil things; not that the vessels of wrath might be of advantage to Him, but that by His own good use of them they might be of advantage to the vessels of mercy. For what could be said more plainly than what is actually said, \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes\"? It is, therefore, in the power of the wicked to sin; but that in sinning they should do this or that by that wickedness is not in their power, but in God's, who divides the darkness and regulates it; so that hence even what they do contrary to God's will is not fulfilled except it be God's will. We read in the Acts of the Apostles that when the apostles had been sent away by the Jews, and had come to their own friends, and shown them what great things the priests and elders said to them, they all with one consent lifted up their voices to the Lord and said, \"Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who, by the mouth of our father David, thy holy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For in truth, there have assembled together in this city against Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, Herod and Pilate, and the people of Israel, to do whatever Thy hand and counsel predestinated to be done.\"[fn-68-P6859_2622614:106-nf] See what is said: \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes.\" Because God's hand and counsel predestinated such things to be done by the hostile Jews as were necessary for the gospel, for our sakes. But what is it that follows? \"But as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sakes.\" For are those enemies who perished in their enmity and those of the same people who still perish in their opposition to Christ,-are those chosen and beloved? Away with the thought! Who is so utterly foolish as to say this? But both expressions, although contrary to one another-that is, \"enemies\" and \"beloved\"-are appropriate, though not to the same men, yet to the same Jewish people, and to the same carnal seed of lsrael, of whom some belonged to the falling away, and some to the blessing of Israel himself. For the apostle previously explained this meaning more dearly when he said, \"That which lsrael wrought for, he hath not obtained; but the election hath obtained in and the rest were blinded?[fn-68-P6860_2623671:107-nf] Yet in both cases it was the very same Israel. Where, therefore, we hear, \"lsrael hath not obtained,\" or, \"The rest were blinded,\" there are to be understood the enemies for our sakes; but where we hear, \"that the election hath obtained it,\" there are to be understood the beloved for their father's sakes, to which fathers those things were assuredly promised; because \"the promises were made to Abraham and his seed,\"[fn-68-P6861_2624110:108-nf] whence also in that olive-tree is grafted the wild olive-tree of the Gentiles. Now subsequently we certainly ought to fall in with the election, of which he says that it is according to grace, not according to debt, because \"there was made a remnant by the election of grace\"[fn-68-P6862_2624407:109-nf] This election obtained it, the rest bring blinded. As concerning this election, the Israelites were beloved for the sake of their fathers. For they were not called with that calling of which it is said, \"Many are called,\" but with that whereby the chosen are called. Whence also after he had said, \"But as concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes,\" he went on to add those words whence this discussion arose: \"For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,\"-that is, they are firmly established without change. Those who belong to this calling are alI teachable by God; nor can any of them say, \"I believed in order to bring thus called,\" because the mercy of God anticipated him, because he was so called in order that he might believe. For all who are teachable of God come to the Son because they have heard and learned from the Father through the Son, who most clearly says, \"Every one who has heard of the Father, and has learned, cometh unto me.\"[fn-68-P6863_2625413:110-nf] But of such as these none perishes, because \"of all that the Father hath given Him, He will lose honed.\"[fn-68-P6864_2625538:111-nf] Whoever, therefore, is of these does not perish at all; nor was any who perishes ever of these.

For if, when I began my books concerning Free Will as a layman, and finished them as a\npresbyter, I still doubted of the condemnation of infants not born again, and of the deliverance of\ninfants that were born again, no one, as I think, would be so unfair and envious as to hinder my\nprogress, and judge that I must continue in that uncertainty.

Therefore, also, grace precedes faith; otherwise, if faith precedes\ngrace, beyond a doubt will also precedes it, because there cannot be faith without will. But if grace\nprecedes faith because it precedes will, certainly it precedes all obedience; it also precedes love,\nby which alone God is truly and pleasantly obeyed.

[XVII.] Among these benefits there remains\nperseverance unto the end, which is daily asked for in vain from the Lord, if the Lord by His grace\ndoes not effect it in him whose prayers He hears. See now how foreign it is from the truth to deny\nthat perseverance even to the end of this life is the gift of God; since He Himself puts an end to\nthis life when He wills, and if He puts an end before a fall that is threatening, He makes the man to\npersevere even unto the end. But more marvellous and more manifest to believers is the largess of\nGod's goodness, that this grace is given even to infants, although there is no obedience at that age\nto which it may be given.

Nay, rather, his love rejoices, and he is not puffed\nup as if he had not received it. Not only, therefore, is he not hindered from this work by the\npreaching of predestination, but he is even assisted to it, so that although he glories he may glory\nin the Lord.","title":"A Treatise on the Gift of\nPerseverance, Being the Second Book","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"170","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"These gifts, therefore, of God, which are given to the elect who are called according to\nGod's purpose, among which gifts is both the beginning of belief and perseverance in the faith to the\ntermination of this life, as I have proved by such a concurrent testimony of reasons and\nauthorities,-these gifts of God, I say, if there is no such predestination as I am maintaining, are\nnot foreknown by God.

He has put away the coats of skin[fn-41-P4130_2734521:36-nf] ; no need is there now for the dwellers in paradise of such I garments as these; but he wears the raiment which the purity of his life has woven into a glorious dress. \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death[fn-41-P4131_2734756:37-nf] \" of such a man, or rather it is not death, but the breaking of bonds, as it is said, \"Thou hast broken my bonds asunder.\" Simeon has been let depart[fn-41-P4132_2734940:38-nf] . He has been freed from the bondage of the body. The \"snare is broken and the bird hath flown away[fn-41-P4133_2735077:39-nf] .\" He has left Egypt behind, this material life. He has crossed[fn-41-P4134_2735160:40-nf] , not this Red Sea of ours, but the black gloomy sea of life. He has entered upon the land of promise, and holds high converse with God upon the mount. He has loosed the sandal of his soul, that with the pure step of thought he may set foot upon that holy land where there is the Vision of God. Having therefore, brethren, this consolation, do ye, who are conveying the bones of our Joseph to the place of blessing, listen to the exhortation of Paul: \"Sorrow not as others who have no hope[fn-41-P4135_2736017:41-nf] .\" Speak to the people there; relate the glorious tale; speak of the incredible wonder, how the people in their myriads, so densely crowded together as to look like a sea of heads, became all one continuous body, and like some watery flood surged around the procession bearing his remains.

Tell them of the eager zeal of all the people, of his joining \"the company of Apostles[fn-41-P4139_2737363:45-nf] ,\" and how the napkins that bound his face were plucked away to make amulets for the faithful. Let it be added to your narration how the Emperor[fn-41-P4140_2738008:46-nf] showed in his countenance his sorrow for this misfortune, and rose from his throne, and how the whole city joined the funeral procession of the Saint. Moreover console each other with the following words; it is a good medicine that Solomon[fn-41-P4141_2738265:47-nf] has for sorrow; for he bids wine be given to the sorrowful; saying this to us, the labourers in the vineyard: \"Give,\" therefore, \"your wine to those that are in sorrow[fn-41-P4142_2738887:48-nf] ,\" not that wine which produces drunkenness, plots against the senses, and destroys the body, but such as gladdens the heart, the wine which the Prophet recommends when he says: \"Wine maketh glad the heart of man[fn-41-P4143_2739241:49-nf] .\" Pledge each other in that liquor undiluted[fn-41-P4144_2739500:50-nf] and with the unstinted goblets of the word, that thus our grief may be turned to joy and gladness, by the grace of the Only-begotten Son of God, through Whom be glory to God, even the Father, for ever and ever.

And, because He of His own free-will is both liberal and kind, lest the whole of this globe, being turned away from the streams of His grace, should wither, He willed the apostles, as founders of our family, to be sent by His Son into the whole world, that the condition of the human race might be conscious of its Founder; and, if it should choose to follow Him, might have One whom even in its supplications it might now call Father instead of God.[fn-101-P10152_3158909:39-nf] And His providence has had or has its course among men, not only individually, but also among cities themselves, and states whose destructions have been announced by the words of prophets; yea, even through the whole world itself; whose end, whose miseries, and wastings, and sufferings on account of unbelief He has allotted. And lest moreover any one should think that such an indefatigable providence of God does not reach to even the very least things, \"One of two sparrows,\" says the Lord, \"shall not fall without the will of the Father; but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\"[fn-101-P10153_3159686:40-nf] And His care and providence did not permit even the clothes of the Israelites to be worn out, nor even the vilest shoes on their feet to be wasted; nor, moreover, finally, the very garments of the captive young men to be burnt. And this is not without reason; for if He embraces all things, and contains all things,-and all things, and the whole, consist of individuals,-His care will consequently extend even to every individual thing, since His providence reaches to the whole, whatever it is. Hence it is that He also sitteth above the Cherubim; that is, He presides over the variety of His works, the living creatures which hold the control over the rest being subjected to His throne:[fn-101-P10154_3160398:41-nf] a crystal covering being thrown over all things; that is, the heaven covering all things, which at the command of God had been consolidated into a firmament[fn-101-P10155_3160592:42-nf] from the fluent material of the waters, that the strong hardness that divides the midst of the waters that covered the earth before, might sustain as if on its back the weight of the superincumbent water, its strength being established by the frost.

So entirely did they do all by way of trade! Observe: vagabond, or, itinerant, Jewish exorcists. And to believe indeed, they had no mind; but by that Name they wished to cast out the demons. \"By Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.\" Only see what a name Paul had got! \"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.\" (v. 14-16.) They did it in secret: then their impotence is publicly exposed. (f) Then not the Name does anything, unless it be spoken with faith. (h) See how they used their weapons against themselves! (j) So far were they from thinking Jesus to be anything great: no, they must needs add Paul, as thinking him to be something great. Here one may marvel how it was that the demon did not cooperate with the imposture of the exorcists, but on the contrary exposed them, and laid open their stage-play. He seems to me (to have done this) in exceeding wrath: just as it might be, if a person being in uttermost peril, should be exposed by some pitiful creature, and wish to vent all his rage upon him. \"Jesus I know, and Paul I know.\" For, that there may not seem to be any slight put upon the Name of Jesus, (the demon) first confesses (Him), and then has permission given him. For, to show that it was not any weakness of the Name, but all owing to the imposture of those men, why did not the same take place in the case of Paul? \"They fled out of that house naked and wounded:\" he sorely battered their heads, perhaps rent their garments. (e) \"And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. And many of them that had believed came confessing and making known their practices.\" (v. 17, 18.) For since they had got to possess such power as, by means of the demons, to do such things, well might this be the consequence. \"And many of them that practised curious arts, brought their books together, and burnt them in the presence of all men;\"-having seen that there was no more use of them now that the demons themselves do these things-\"and reckoned up the price of them, and found the amount fifty thousand pieces of silver.[fn-15-P1569_1512187:5-nf] So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.\" (v. 19, 20.)

Thou shall not worship idols. Thou shalt not corrupt boys. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shall not bear false witness. Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-46-P4617_1419570:179-nf] And so forth. These things are to be observed, and whatever else is commanded in reading the Bible. And He enjoins on us by Isaiah: \"Wash you, and make you clean. Put away iniquities from your souls before mine eyes. Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Deliver the wronged. Judge for the orphan, and justify the widow. And come, and let us reason together, saith the Lord.\"[fn-46-P4618_1419966:180-nf] And we shall find many examples also in other places,-as, for instance, respecting prayer: \"Good works are an acceptable prayer to the Lord,\" says the Scripture.[fn-46-P4619_1420155:181-nf] And the manner of prayer is described. \"If thou seest,\" it is said, \"the naked, cover him; and thou shalt not overlook those who belong to thy seed. Then shall thy light spring forth early, and thy healing shall spring up quickly; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall encompass thee.\" What, then, is the fruit of such prayer? \"Then shall thou call, and God will hear thee; whilst thou art yet speaking, He will say, I am here.\"[fn-46-P4620_1420645:182-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":11,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_48_oration_xxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XV.

Even as Esaias saith, \"The children of Jacob shall strike root, and Israel shall flourish, and the whole world shall be filled with his fruit.\"[fn-80-P8044_2217972:38-nf] The fruit, therefore, having been sown throughout all the world, she (Jerusalem) was deservedly forsaken, and those things which had formerly brought forth fruit abundantly were taken away; for from these, according to the flesh, were Christ and the apostles enabled to bring forth fruit. But now these are no longer useful for bringing forth fruit.

For as these men did not impute unto us (the Gentiles) our transgressions, which we wrought before Christ was manifested among us, so also it is not right that we should lay blame upon those who sinned before Christ's coming.

For if these men of old time, who preceded us in the gifts [bestowed upon them], and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they committed any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such disgrace, what shall the men of the present day suffer, who have despised the Lord's coming, and become the slaves of their own lusts? And truly the death of the Lord became [the means of] healing and remission of sins to the former, but Christ shall not die again in behalf of those who now commit sin, for death shall no more have dominion over Him; but the Son shall come in the glory of the Father, requiring from His stewards and dispensers the money which He had entrusted to them, with usury; and from those to whom He had given most shall He demand most. We ought not, therefore, as that presbyter remarks, to be puffed up, nor be severe upon those of old time, but ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have come to] the knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no further forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom.[fn-85-P8533_2403564:387-nf] And therefore it was that Paul said, \"For if [God] spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest He also spare not thee, who, when thou wert a wild olive tree, wert grafted into the fatness of the olive tree, and wert made a partaker of its fatness.\"[fn-85-P8534_2404102:388-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":11,"verse":36,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_61_book_vi_","source_chapter":66,"source_paragraph":"222","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Celsus proceeds to say of God that \"of Him are all things,\" abandoning (in so speaking), I know not how, all his principles;[fn-107-P10726_2859623:339-nf] while our Paul declares, that \"of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things,\"[fn-107-P10727_2859829:340-nf] showing that He is the beginning of the substance of all things by the words \"of Him,\" and the bond of their subsistence by the expression \"through Him,\" and their final end by the terms \"to Him.\" Of a truth, God is of nothing.

By which things, and by many deeds of this kind tending to His glory, it appeared to follow as a consequence, that in whatever manner the Jews think about Christ, and although they do not believe concerning Jesus Christ our Lord, that even they themselves thought that such and so great a one would without any death endure to eternity, and would possess the kingdom of Israel, and of the whole world for ever; and that it should not be destroyed. Whence, moreover, the Jews dared to seize Him by force, and anoint Him for the kingdom, which indeed He was compelled to evade; and therefore His disciples thought that in no other way would He bestow upon them eternal life, except He Himself had first continued this temporal life into that eternal one in His own experience. In fine, when they were passing through Galilee, Jesus said to them, \"The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and after three days He shall rise again.\"[fn-107-P10750_3400636:21-nf] and they were greatly grieved, because, as we have said, they had formed a very different notion previously in their minds and hearts. And again, this also was the speech of the Jews, in contradiction against Him, when He taught them of Himself, and announced future things to them, and they said, \"We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? \"[fn-107-P10751_3401073:22-nf] And so there was this same presumption concerning Christ in the mind of the disciples, even as Peter himself, the leader and chief of the apostles, broke forth into that expression of his own incredulity. For when he, together with the others, had been asked by the Lord what he thought about Him, that is, whom he thought Him to be, and had first of all confessed the truth, saying that He was the Christ the Son of the living God, and therefore was judged blessed by Him because he had arrived at this truth, not after the flesh, but by the revelation of the heavenly Father; yet this same Peter, when Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after the third day rise again from the dead; nevertheless that true confessor of Christ, after a few days, taking Him aside, began to rebuke Him, saying, \"Be propitious to Thyself: this shall not be; \"[fn-107-P10752_3402048:23-nf] so that on that account he deserved to hear from the Lord, \"Get thee behind me, Satan;[fn-107-P10753_3402155:24-nf] thou art an offence unto me, because he savoured not the things which are of God, but those things which are of men.\" Which rebuke against Peter became more and more apparent when the Lord was apprehended, and, frightened by the damsel, he said, \"I know not what thou sayest, neither know I thee; \"[fn-107-P10754_3402761:25-nf] and again when, using an oath, he said this same thing; and for the third time, cursing and swearing, he affirmed that he knew not the man, and not once, but frequently, denied Him.[fn-107-P10755_3402964:26-nf] And this disposition, because it was to continue to him even to the Lord's passion, was long before made manifest by the Lord, that we also might not be ignorant of it. Again, after the Lord's resurrection, one of His disciples, Cleopas, when he was, according to the error of all his fellow-disciples, sorrowfully telling what had happened to the Lord Himself, as if to some unknown person, spoke thus, saying of Jesus the Nazarene, \"who was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people; how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and fastened Him to the cross. But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel.\"[fn-107-P10756_3403932:27-nf] And in addition to these things, all the disciples also judged the declaration of the women who had seen the Lord after the resurrection to be idle tales; and some of themselves, when they had seen Him, believed not, but doubted; and they who were not then present believed not at all until they had been subsequently by the Lord Himself in all ways rebuked and reproached; because His death had so offended them that they thought that He had not risen again, who they had believed ought not to have died, because contrary to their belief He had died once. And thus, as far as concerns the disciples themselves, they are found to have had a faith neither sound nor perfect in such matters as we have referred to; and what is much more serious, they moreover baptized others, as it is written in the Gospel according to John.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":11,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_65_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"257","folder":"ANF-02","text":"To these statements the apostle will testify: \"I know a man in Christ, caught up into the third heaven, and thence into Paradise, who heard unutterable words which it is not lawful for a man to speak,\"-intimating thus the impossibility of expressing God, and indicating that what is divine is unutterable by human[fn-75-P7586_2288678:142-nf] power; if, indeed, he begins to speak above the third heaven, as it is lawful to initiate the elect souls in the mysteries there.

For such is the Victim, That was offered for us, Who is both in Name and fact the Garment of incorruption.

A Male, because offered for Adam; or rather the Stronger for the strong, when the first Man had fallen under sin; and chiefly because there is in Him nothing feminine, nothing unmanly; but He burst from the bonds of thee Virgin-Mother's womb with much power, and a Male was brought forth by the Prophetess,[fn-59-P5905_2038352:17-nf] as Isaiah declares the good tidings.

And this too we can prove by the instances of calls in the gospels. For He chose Andrew and Peter and the rest of the apostles by the free compassion of His grace when they were thinking nothing of their healing and salvation. Zacchaeus, when in his faithfulness he was struggling to see the Lord, and making up for his littleness of stature by the height of the sycamore tree, He not only received, but actually honoured by the blessing of His dwelling with him. Paul even against his will and resisting He drew to Him. Another He charged to cleave to Him so closely that when he asked for the shortest possible delay in order to bury his father He did not grant it. To Cornelius when constantly attending to prayers and alms the way of salvation was shown by way of recompense, and by the visitation of an angel he was bidden to summon Peter, and learn from him the words of salvation, whereby he might be saved with all his. And so the manifold wisdom of God grants with manifold and inscrutable kindness salvation to men; and imparts to each one according to his capacity the grace of His bounty, so that He wills to grant His healing not according to the uniform power of His Majesty but according to the measure of the faith in which He finds each one, or as He Himself has imparted it to each one.

When another believed that what was essential for his salvation depended on His command, and answered: \"Speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed,\"[fn-54-P5401_1936263:100-nf] He restored to their former strength the limbs that were relaxed, by the power of a word, saying: \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee.\"[fn-54-P5402_1936440:101-nf] To others hoping for restoration from the touch of His hem, He granted rich gifts of healing. To some, when asked, He bestowed remedies for their diseases. To others He afforded the means of healing unasked: others He urged on to hope, saying: \"Willest thou to be made whole?\"[fn-54-P5403_1936737:102-nf] to others when they were without hope He brought help spontaneously. The desires of some He searched out before satisfying their wants, saying: \"What will ye that I should do for you?\"[fn-54-P5404_1936943:103-nf] To another who knew not the way to obtain what he desired, He showed it in His kindness, saying: \"If thou believest thou shalt see the glory of God.\"[fn-54-P5405_1937117:104-nf] Among some so richly did He pour forth the mighty works of His cures that of them the Evangelist says' \"And He healed all their sick.\"[fn-54-P5406_1937276:105-nf] But among others the unfathomable depth of Christ's beneficence was so stopped up, that it was said: \"And Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their unbelief.\"[fn-54-P5407_1937472:106-nf] And so the bounty of God is actually shaped according to the capacity of man's faith, so that to one it is said:\" According to thy faith be it unto thee:\"[fn-54-P5408_1937652:107-nf] and toanother: \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee;\"[fn-54-P5409_1937751:108-nf] to another \"Be it unto thee according as thou wilt,\"[fn-54-P5410_1937830:109-nf] and again to another: \"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\"[fn-54-P5411_1937910:110-nf] ","title":"XIII.

And that at one time He gives his assistance for the fulfilment of those things which he sees that we desire for our good, while at another time He puts into us the very beginnings of holy desire, and grants both the commencement of a good work and perseverance in it. Hence it comes that in our prayers we proclaim God as not only our Protector and Saviour, but actually as our Helper and Sponsor. For whereas He first calls us to Him, and while we are still ignorant and unwilling, draws us towards salvation, He is our Protector and Saviour, but whereas when we are already striving, He is wont to bring us help, and to receive and defend those who fly to Him for refuge, He is termed our Sponsor and Refuge. Finally the blessed Apostle when revolving in his mind this manifold bounty of God's providence, as he sees that he has fallen into some vast and boundless ocean of God's goodness, exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are the judgments of God and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord?\"[fn-54-P5424_1942912:115-nf] Whoever then imagines that he can by human reason fathom the depths of that inconceivable abyss, will be trying to explain away the astonishment at that knowledge, at which that great and mighty teacher of the gentiles was awed. For if a man thinks that he can either conceive in his mind or discuss exhaustively the dispensation of God whereby He works salvation in men, he certainly impugns the truth of the Apostle's words and asserts with profane audacity that His judgments can be scrutinized, and His ways searched out. This providence and love of God therefore, which the Lord in His unwearied goodness vouchsafes to show us, He compares to the tenderest heart of a kind mother, as He wishes to express it by a figure of human affection, and finds in His creatures no such feeling of love, to which he could better compare it. And He uses this example, because nothing dearer can be found in human nature, saying: \"Can a mother forget her child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?\" But not content with this comparison He at once goes beyond it, and subjoins these words: \"And though she may forget, yet will not I forget thee.\"[fn-54-P5425_1944097:116-nf] ","title":"XIII.

But with God this cannot be; for He is not composed of parts, but being impassible and simple, He is impassibly and indivisibly Father of the Son. This again is strongly evidenced and proved by divine Scripture. For the Word of God is His Son, and the Son is the Father's Word and Wisdom; and Word and Wisdom is neither creature nor part of Him whose Word He is, nor an offspring passibly begotten. Uniting then the two titles, Scripture speaks of `Son,' in order to herald the natural and true offspring of His essence; and, on the other hand, that none may think of the Offspring humanly, while signifying His essence, it also calls Him Word, Wisdom, and Radiance; to teach us that the generation was impassible, and eternal, and worthy of God.[fn-54-P5484_2162798:167-nf] What affection then, or what part of the Father is the Word and the Wisdom and the Radiance?

Enough was said above to shew that the offspring from God is not an affection; and now it has been shewn in particular that the Word is not begotten according to affection. The same may be said of Wisdom; God is not as man; nor must they here think humanly of Him.

Senseless are these Arians; for what likeness is there between Son and work, that they should parallel a father's with a maker's function? How is it that, with that difference between offspring and work, which has been shewn, they remain so ill-instructed? Let it be repeated then, that a work is external to the nature, but a son is the proper offspring of the essence; it follows that a work need not have been always, for the workman frames it when he will; but an offspring is not subject to will, but is proper to the essence[fn-54-P5487_2167059:170-nf] .

For such are the words of the Apostle; \"Attend,\" he says, \"to what Elias saith: Lord, they have killed Thy Prophets, they have overthrown Thine altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of God to him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee before Baal.\"[fn-52-P5234_2228100:13-nf] Thou thinkest that thou art the only servant who is working faithfully: there are others too who fear Me, and they not few. For I have \"seven thousand\" there. And then he added, \"Even so then at this present time also.\" For some Jews believed, though the most were reprobate; like him who carried holes for foxes in his heart. \"Even so then,\" saith he, \"at this present time also, there is a remnant saved through the election of grace:\" that is, there is the same Christ even now, as then, who also then said to that Elias, \"I have reserved to Myself.\" What is, \"I have reserved to Myself\"? I have chosen them, because I saw their hearts that they trusted in Me, and not in themselves,nor in Baal. They are not changed, they are as they were made by Me. And thou who art speaking, except thou hadst placed thy trust in Me, where wouldest thou be? Except thou wert replenished by My grace, wouldest not thou too be bowing the knee before Baal? But thou art replenished by My grace; because thou hast not put thy trust at all in thine own strength, but wholly in My grace. Do not therefore glory in this, as to suppose thou hast no fellow-servants in thy service; there are others whom I have chosen, as I have chosen thee, those, namely, who put their trust in Me; as the Apostle says, \"Even now also a remnant is saved through the election of grace.\"","title":"Sermon L.

They, however, for whatever reason, still do not succumb; but, as swine and dogs wallow[fn-58-P5802_2311534:1-nf] in their own vomit and their own mire, rather invent new expedients for their irreligion. Thus they misunderstand the passage in the Proverbs, `The Lord hath created me a beginning of His ways for His works[fn-58-P5803_2311771:2-nf] ,' and the words of the Apostle, `Who was faithful to Him that made Him[fn-58-P5804_2311889:3-nf] ,' and straightway argue, that the Son of God is a work and a creature. But although they might have learned from what is said above, had they not utterly lost their power of apprehension, that the Son is not from nothing nor in the number of things originate at all, the Truth witnessing[fn-58-P5805_2312194:4-nf] it (for, being God, He cannot be a work, and it is impious to call Him a creature, and it is of creatures and works that we say, `out of nothing,' and `it was not before its generation'), yet since, as if dreading to desert their own fiction, they are accustomed to allege the aforesaid passages of divine Scripture, which have a good meaning, but are by them practised on, let us proceed afresh to take up the question of the sense of these, to remind the faithful, and to shew from each of these passages that they have no knowledge at all of Christianity. Were it otherwise, they would not have shut themselves up in the unbelief[fn-58-P5806_2312853:5-nf] of the present Jews[fn-58-P5807_2312893:6-nf] , but would have inquired and learned[fn-58-P5808_2313227:7-nf] that, whereas `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,' in consequence, it was when at the good pleasure of the Father the Word became man, that it was said of Him, as by John, `The Word became flesh[fn-58-P5809_2313562:8-nf] ;' so by Peter, `He hath made Him Lord and Christ[fn-58-P5810_2313627:9-nf] ';-as by means of Solomon in the Person of the Lord Himself, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works[fn-58-P5811_2313764:10-nf] ;' so by Paul, `Become so much better than the Angels[fn-58-P5812_2313839:11-nf] ;' and again, `He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant[fn-58-P5813_2313930:12-nf] ;' and again, `Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Jesus, who was faithful to Him that made Him[fn-58-P5814_2314125:13-nf] .' For all these texts have the same force and meaning, a religious one, declarative of the divinity of the Word, even those of them which speak humanly concerning Him, as having become the Son of man. But, though this distinction is sufficient for their refutation, still, since from a misconception of the Apostle's words (to mention them first), they consider the Word of God to be one of the works, because of its being written, `Who was faithful to Him that made Him,' I have thought it needful to silence this further argument of theirs, taking in hand[fn-58-P5815_2314728:14-nf] , as before, their statement.

The Jews then, most of them[fn-59-P5914_2361288:93-nf] , hearing this, came to themselves and forthwith acknowledged the Christ, as it is written in the Acts. But, the Ario-maniacs on the contrary choose to remain Jews, and to contend with Peter; so let us proceed to place before them some parallel phrases; perhaps it may have some effect upon them, to find what the usage is of divine Scripture. Now that Christ is everlasting Lord and King, has become plain by what has gone before, nor is there a man to doubt about it; for being Son of God, He must be like Him[fn-59-P5915_2361857:94-nf] , and being like, He is certainly both Lord and King, for He says Himself, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.' On the other hand, that Peter's there words, `He hath made Him both Lord and Christ,' do not imply the Son to be a creature, may be seen from Isaac's blessing, though this illustration is but a faint one for our subject. Now he said to Jacob, `Become thou lord over thy brother;' and to Esau, `Behold, I have made him thy lord[fn-59-P5916_2362321:95-nf] .' Now though the word `made' had implied Jacob's essence and the coming into being, even then it would not be right in them as much as to imagine the same of the Word of God, for the Son of God is no creature as Jacob was; besides, they might inquire and so rid themselves of that extravagance. But if they, do not understand it of his essence nor of his coming into being, though Jacob was by nature creature and work, is not their madness worse than the Devil's[fn-59-P5917_2362823:96-nf] , if what they dare not ascribe in consequence of a like phrase even to things by nature originate, that they attach to the Son of God, saying that He is a creature?

Now why it was that, though He knew, He did not tell His disciples plainly at that time, no one may be curious[fn-68-P6869_2724104:315-nf] where He has been silent; for `Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor[fn-68-P6870_2724226:316-nf] ?' but why, though He knew, He said, `no, not the Son knows,' this I think none of the faithful is ignorant, viz. that He made this as those other declarations as man by reason of the flesh. For this as before is not the Word's deficiency[fn-68-P6871_2724485:317-nf] , but of that human nature[fn-68-P6872_2724530:318-nf] whose property it is to be ignorant. And this again will be weIl seen by honestly examining into the occasion, when and to whom the Saviour spoke thus. Not then when the heaven was made by Him, nor when He was with the Father Himself, the Word `disposing all things[fn-68-P6873_2724821:319-nf] ,' nor before He became man did He say it, but when `the Word became flesh[fn-68-P6874_2724924:320-nf] .' On this account it is reasonable to ascribe to His manhood everything which, after He became man, He speaks humanly. For it is proper to the Word to know what was made, nor be ignorant either of the beginning or of the end of these (for the works are His), and He knows how many things He wrought, and the limit of their consistence. And knowing of each the beginning and the end, He knows surely the general and common end of all. Certainly when He says in the Gospel concerning Himself in His human character, `Father, the hour is come, glorify Thy Son[fn-68-P6875_2725501:321-nf] ,' it is plain that He knows also the hour of the end of all things, as the Word, though as man He is ignorant of it, for ignorance is proper to man[fn-68-P6876_2725670:322-nf] , and especially ignorance of these things. Moreover this is proper to the Saviour's love of man; for since He was made man, He is not ashamed, because of the flesh which is ignorant[fn-68-P6877_2727888:323-nf] , to say `I know not,' that He may shew that knowing as God, He is but ignorant according to the flesh[fn-68-P6878_2728007:324-nf] . And therefore He said not, `no, not the Son of God knows,' test the Godhead should seem ignorant, but simply, `no, not the Son,' that the ignorance might be the Son's as born from among men.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":11,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_85_homily_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Since then he had sufficiently comforted them, he wishes also to make them vie with each other,[fn-30-P3004_2830312:1-nf] and labor more in earnest, by showing that it is themselves that give the grounds for their receiving more or less.

But consider, I pray you, the great punishment we shall suffer, if we give offence at all. For if in a case where the thing was against law, yet, as they rebuked unseasonably, he forbade their doing it, in order that a brother might not be made to offend and stumble; when we give an offence without having anything to set right even, what treatment shall we deserve? For if not saving others be a crime (and that it is so, he who buried the talent proves), what will be the effect of giving him offence also? But what if he gives himself the offence, you may say, by being weak? Why this is just why thou oughtest to be patient. For if he were strong, then he would not require so much attention. But now, since he is of the feebler sort, he does on this ground need considerable care. Let us then yield him this, and in all respects bear his burdens, as it is not of our own sins only that we shall have to give an account, but for those also wherein we cause others to offend. For if that account, were even by itself hard to pass, when these be added too, how are we to be saved? And let us not suppose, that if we can find accomplices in our sins, that will be an excuse; as this will prove an addition to our punishment. Since the serpent too was punished more than the woman, as was the woman likewise more than the man (1 Tim. ii. 14); and Jezebel also was punished more severely than Ahab, who had seized the vineyard; for it was she that devised the whole matter, and caused the king to offend. (1 Kings xxi. 23, 1 Kings xxi. 25, 1 Kings xxi. 29.) And therefore thou, when thou art the author of destruction to others, wilt suffer more severely[fn-31-P3169_2957565:8-nf] than those who have been subverted by thee. For sinning is not so ruinous as leading others also into the same. Wherefore he speaks of those who \"not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.\" (Rom. i. 32) And so when we see any sinning, let us, so far from thrusting them on, even pull them back from the pit of iniquity, that we may not have to be punished for the ruin of others besides ourselves. And let us be continually in mind of the awful judgment-seat, of the stream of fire, of the chains never to be loosed, of the darkness with no light, the gnashing of teeth, and the venomous worm. \"Ah, but God is merciful!\" Are these then mere words? and was not that rich man punished for despising Lazarus? Are not the foolish[fn-31-P3170_2958437:9-nf] virgins cast out of the Bride-chamber? Do not they who did not feed Him go away into \"the fire prepared for the devil?\" (Matt. xxv. 41.) Will not he that hath soiled garments be \"bound hand and foot\" (ib. xxii. 13), and go to ruin? Will, not he that demanded the hundred pence to be paid, be given over to the tormentors? Is not that said of the adulterers[fn-31-P3171_2958896:10-nf] true, that \"their worm shall not die, nor their fire be quenched?\"[fn-31-P3172_2959073:11-nf] (Mark ix. 43.) Are these but mere threats then? Yea, it is answered. And from what source pray dost thou venture to make such an assertion, and that too when thou passest judgment of thine own opinion? Why, I shall be able to prove the contrary, both from what He said, and from what He did. (See John v. 22.) For if you will not believe by the punishments that are to come, at least believe by those that have happened already. For what have happened, and have come forth into reality, surely are not threats and words. Who then was it that flooded the whole world, and affected that baleful wreck, and the utter destruction of our whole race! Who was it that after this hurled those thunders and lightnings upon the land of Sodom? Who that drowned all Egypt in the sea? Who that consumed the six hundred thousand men in the wilderness? Who that burnt up the synagogue of Abiram? Who that bade the earth open her mouth for the company of Core and Dathan, and swallow them up? Who that carried off the threescore and ten thousand at one sweep in David's time? Shall I mention also those that were punished individually! Cain, who was given up to a continual vengeance? (the son of) Charmi,[fn-31-P3173_2960773:12-nf] who was stoned with his whole family? Or him, that suffered the same thing for gathering sticks on the sabbath? The forty children who were consumed by those beasts, and obtained no pardon even on the score of their age? And if you would see these same things even after the times of grace, just consider what great suffering the Jews had, how the women ate their children, some roasting them, and some consuming them in other ways:[fn-31-P3174_2961293:13-nf] how after being given up to irremediable famine, and wars varied and severe, they threw all previous catastrophes into the shade by the exceeding greatness of their own calamities. For that it was Christ Who did these things unto them, hear Him declaring as much, both by parables, and clearly and explicitly. By parables, as when He says. \"But those that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay them\" (Luke xix. 27); and by that of the vineyard, and that of the marriage. But clearly and explicitly, as when He threatens that they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into the nations, and there shall be upon the earth \"distress of nations with perplexity, at the roaring of the sea and waves;[fn-31-P3175_2962101:14-nf] men's hearts failing them for fear.\" (ib. xxi. 24, 25, 26.) \"And there shall be tribulation, such as there never was, no, nor ever shall be.\" (Matt. xxiv. 21.) And what a punishment Ananias too and Sapphira suffered, for the theft of a few pieces of money, ye all know. Seest thou not the daily calamities also? Or have these too not taken place? Seest thou not now men that are pining with famine? those that suffer elephantiasis, or are maimed in body? those that live in constant poverty, those that suffer countless irreparable evils? Now then will it be reasonable for some to be punished, and some not? For if God be not unjust (and unjust He is not), thou also wilt assuredly suffer punishment, if thou sinnest. But if because He is merciful He doth not punish, then ought not these either to have been punished.

But now that some are punished, and some are not, though they be the worse sinners, how can it be reasonable that there be not the same punishments for the same sins? How can those punished appear to be else than wronged? What reason is there then why all are not punished here? Hear His own defence for these things. For when some had died by the falling of a tower on them: He said to those who raised a question upon this, \"Suppose ye that they were sinners above all men?

For except we change our conduct, we assuredly shall suffer. And how, it may be said, is it that we are to be punished without end for sinning a short time here? how, I ask, is it that in this world,[fn-31-P3179_2964883:17-nf] those who in a short moment of time have done one murder, are condemned to constant punishment in the mines? \"But it is not God that does this,\" it may be said. How then came He to keep the man with a palsy for thirty and eight years in so great punishments? For that it was for sins that He punished him, hear what He says, \"Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more.\" (John v. 14.) Still it is said, he found a release. But the case is not so with the other life. For that there, there will never be any release,[fn-31-P3180_2965458:18-nf] hear from His own mouth, \"Their worm will not die, nor their fire be quenched.\" (Mark ix. 44.) And \"these shall go into everlasting life, but these into everlasting punishment.\" (Matt. xxv. 46.) Now if the life be eternal, the punishment is eternal. Seest thou not how severely He threatened the Jews? Then have the things threatened come to pass, or were those that were told them a mere talk? \"One stone shall not remain upon another.\" (Luke xxi. 6.) And has it remained? But what, when He says, \"There shall be tribulation such as hath not been?\" (Matt. xxiv. 21.) Has it not come then? Read the history of Josephus, and thou wilt not be able to draw thy breath even, at only hearing what they suffered for their doings. This I say, not that I may pain you, but that I may make you secure, and lest by having humored you overmuch, I should but make a way for the endurance of sorer punishments. For why, pray, dost thou not deem it right thou shouldest be punished for sinning? Hath He not told thee all beforehand? Hath He not threatened thee? not come to thy aid?[fn-31-P3181_2966587:19-nf] not done things even without number for thy salvation's sake? Gave He thee not the laver of Regeneration, and forgave He not all thy former sins? Hath He not after this forgiveness, and the laver, also given thee the succor of repentance if thou sin? Hath He not made the way to forgiveness of sins, even after all this, easy[fn-31-P3182_2966954:20-nf] to thee? Hear then what He hath enjoined: \"If thou forgive thy neighbor, I also will forgive thee\" (ib. vi. 14), He says. What hardship is there in this? \"If ye judge the cause of the fatherless, and see that the widow have right, come and let us converse together,\" He saith, \"and if your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow.\" (Is. i. 17, 18.) What labor is there here? \"Tell thy sins, that thou mayest be justified.\" (Is. xliii. 26 LXX.) What hardship is there in this? \"Redeem thy sins with alms.\" (Dan. iv. 24.) What toilsomeness is there in this? The Publican said, \"Be merciful to me a sinner,\" and \"went down home justified.\" (Luke xviii. 13, 14.) What labor is it to imitate the Publican? And wilt thou not be persuaded even after this that there is punishment and vengeance? At that rate thou wilt deny that even the devil is punished For, \"Depart,\" He says, \"into the fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\" (Matt. xxv. 41.) Now if there be no hell, then neither is he punished. But if he is punished, it is plain that we shall also. For we also have disobeyed, even if it be not in the same way. And how comest thou not to be afraid to speak such daring things? For when thou sayest that God is merciful, and doth not punish, if He should punish he will be found in thy case to be no longer merciful. See then unto what language the devil leadeth you? And what are the monks that have taken up with the mountains, and yield examples of such manifold self-denial,[fn-31-P3183_2969776:21-nf] to go away without their crown? For if the wicked are not to be punished, and there is no recompense made to any one, some one else will say, perhaps, that neither are the good crowned. Nay, it will be said, For this is suitable with God, that there should be a kingdom only, and not a hell. Well then, shall the whoremonger, and the adulterer, and the man who hath done evils unnumbered, enjoy the same advantages with the man who has exhibited soberness and holiness, and Paul is to stand with Nero, or rather even the devil with Paul? For if there be no hell and yet there will be a Resurrection of all, then the wicked will attain to the same good things! And who would say this? Who even of men that were quite crazed? or rather, which of the devils even would say this? For even they confess that there is a hell.

And how, it may be said, is it that we are to be punished without end for sinning a short time here? how, I ask, is it that in this world,[fn-31-P3179_2964883:17-nf] those who in a short moment of time have done one murder, are condemned to constant punishment in the mines? \"But it is not God that does this,\" it may be said. How then came He to keep the man with a palsy for thirty and eight years in so great punishments? For that it was for sins that He punished him, hear what He says, \"Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more.\" (John v. 14.) Still it is said, he found a release. But the case is not so with the other life. For that there, there will never be any release,[fn-31-P3180_2965458:18-nf] hear from His own mouth, \"Their worm will not die, nor their fire be quenched.\" (Mark ix. 44.) And \"these shall go into everlasting life, but these into everlasting punishment.\" (Matt. xxv. 46.) Now if the life be eternal, the punishment is eternal. Seest thou not how severely He threatened the Jews? Then have the things threatened come to pass, or were those that were told them a mere talk? \"One stone shall not remain upon another.\" (Luke xxi. 6.) And has it remained? But what, when He says, \"There shall be tribulation such as hath not been?\" (Matt. xxiv. 21.) Has it not come then? Read the history of Josephus, and thou wilt not be able to draw thy breath even, at only hearing what they suffered for their doings. This I say, not that I may pain you, but that I may make you secure, and lest by having humored you overmuch, I should but make a way for the endurance of sorer punishments. For why, pray, dost thou not deem it right thou shouldest be punished for sinning? Hath He not told thee all beforehand? Hath He not threatened thee? not come to thy aid?[fn-31-P3181_2966587:19-nf] not done things even without number for thy salvation's sake? Gave He thee not the laver of Regeneration, and forgave He not all thy former sins? Hath He not after this forgiveness, and the laver, also given thee the succor of repentance if thou sin? Hath He not made the way to forgiveness of sins, even after all this, easy[fn-31-P3182_2966954:20-nf] to thee? Hear then what He hath enjoined: \"If thou forgive thy neighbor, I also will forgive thee\" (ib. vi. 14), He says. What hardship is there in this? \"If ye judge the cause of the fatherless, and see that the widow have right, come and let us converse together,\" He saith, \"and if your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow.\" (Is. i. 17, 18.) What labor is there here? \"Tell thy sins, that thou mayest be justified.\" (Is. xliii. 26 LXX.) What hardship is there in this? \"Redeem thy sins with alms.\" (Dan. iv. 24.) What toilsomeness is there in this? The Publican said, \"Be merciful to me a sinner,\" and \"went down home justified.\" (Luke xviii. 13, 14.) What labor is it to imitate the Publican? And wilt thou not be persuaded even after this that there is punishment and vengeance? At that rate thou wilt deny that even the devil is punished For, \"Depart,\" He says, \"into the fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\" (Matt. xxv. 41.) Now if there be no hell, then neither is he punished. But if he is punished, it is plain that we shall also. For we also have disobeyed, even if it be not in the same way. And how comest thou not to be afraid to speak such daring things? For when thou sayest that God is merciful, and doth not punish, if He should punish he will be found in thy case to be no longer merciful. See then unto what language the devil leadeth you? And what are the monks that have taken up with the mountains, and yield examples of such manifold self-denial,[fn-31-P3183_2969776:21-nf] to go away without their crown? For if the wicked are not to be punished, and there is no recompense made to any one, some one else will say, perhaps, that neither are the good crowned. Nay, it will be said, For this is suitable with God, that there should be a kingdom only, and not a hell. Well then, shall the whoremonger, and the adulterer, and the man who hath done evils unnumbered, enjoy the same advantages with the man who has exhibited soberness and holiness, and Paul is to stand with Nero, or rather even the devil with Paul? For if there be no hell and yet there will be a Resurrection of all, then the wicked will attain to the same good things! And who would say this? Who even of men that were quite crazed? or rather, which of the devils even would say this? For even they confess that there is a hell.

Now the cause of this to them was the slaying of the Lord, and that they did not reverence the Only-Begotten.

Such, as you have just heard, brethren, is the question that comes before us, and you can perceive how profound it is; but we shall give what answer we can. \"They could not believe,\" because that Isaiah the prophet foretold it; and the prophet foretold it because God foreknew that such would be the case. But if I am asked why they could not, I reply at once, because they would not; for certainly their depraved will was foreseen by God, and foretold through the prophet by Him from whom nothing that is future can be hid. But the prophet, sayest thou, assigns another cause than that of their will. What cause does the prophet assign? That \"God hath given them the spirit of remorse, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear; and hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart.\" This also, I reply, their will deserved. For God thus blinds and hardens, simply by letting alone and withdrawing His aid: and God can do this by a judgment that is hidden, although not by one that is unrighteous. This is a doctrine which the piety of the God-fearing ought to preserve unshaken and inviolable in all its integrity: even as the apostle, when treating of the same intricate question, says, \"What shall we say then? is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.\"[fn-23-P2311_1412012:3-nf] If, then, we must be far from thinking that there is unrighteousness with God, this only can it be,that, when He giveth His aid, He acteth mercifully; and, when He withholdeth it, He acteth righteously: for in all He doeth, He acteth not rashly, but in accordance with judgment. And still further, if the judgments of the saints are righteous, how much more those of the sanctifying and justifying God? They are therefore righteous, although hidden. Accordingly, when questions of this sort come before us, why one is dealt with in such a way, and another in such another way; why this one is blinded by being forsaken of God, and that one is enlightened by the divine aid vouchsafed to him: let us not take upon ourselves to pass judgment on the judgment of so mighty a judge, but tremblingly exclaim with the apostle, \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"[fn-23-P2312_1412984:4-nf] As it is also said in the psalm, \"Thy judgments are as a great deep.\"[fn-23-P2313_1413070:5-nf] ","title":"Tractate LIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":34,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_35_book_v_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"ANF-08","text":"\"But you say: Then those who adore what ought not to be adored, should be immediately destroyed by God, to prevent others doing the like.

Let us, brethren, let us understand, and may the Lord enable us to understand, and enable us also to do what we understand. And if we know this, we know of a truth what the Lord doeth; for it is only the Lord that so enables us, and by such means only do we attain to His friendship. For just as there are two kinds of fear, which produce two classes of fearers; so there are two kinds of service, which produce two classes of servants. There is a fear, which perfect love casteth out;[fn-29-P2959_1690430:3-nf] and there is another fear, which is clean, and endureth for ever.[fn-29-P2960_1690514:4-nf] The fear that lies not in love, the apostle pointed to when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\"[fn-29-P2961_1690662:5-nf] But he referred to the clean fear when he said, \"Be not high-minded, but fear.\"[fn-29-P2962_1690760:6-nf] In that fear which love casteth out, there has also to be cast out the service along with it: for both were joined together by the apostle, that is, the service and the fear, when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\" And it was the servant connected with this kind of service that the Lord also had in His eye when He said, \"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.\" Certainly not the servant characterized by the clean fear, to whom it is said, \"Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy lord;\" but the servant who is characterized by the fear which love casteth out, of whom He elsewhere saith, \"The servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever.\"[fn-29-P2963_1691547:7-nf] Since, therefore, He hath given us power to become the sons of God,[fn-29-P2964_1691634:8-nf] let us not be servants, but sons: that, in some wonderful and indescribable but real way, we may as servants have the power not to be servants; servants, indeed, with that clean fear which distinguishes the servant that enters into the joy of his lord, but not servants with the fear that i has to be cast out, and which marketh him that abideth not in the house for ever. But let us bear in mind that it is the Lord that enableth us to serve so as not to be servants. And this it is that is unknown to the servant, who knoweth not what his Lord doeth; and who, when he doeth any good thing, is lifted up as if he did it himself, and not his Lord; and so, glories not in the Lord, but in himself, thereby deceiving himself, because glorying, as if he had not received.[fn-29-P2965_1692419:9-nf] But let us, beloved, in order that we may be the friends of the Lord, know what our Lord doeth. For it is He who makes us not only men, but also righteous, and not we ourselves. And who but He is the doer, in leading us to such a knowledge? For \"we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-29-P2966_1692829:10-nf] Whatever good there is, is freely given by Him. And so because this also is good, by Him who graciously imparteth all good is this gift of knowing likewise bestowed; that, in respect of all good things whatever, he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.[fn-29-P2967_1693101:11-nf] But the words that follow, \"But I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you,\" are so profound, that we must by no means compress them within the limits of the present discourse, but leave them over till another.","title":"Tractate LXXXV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_91_tractate_lxxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. \"Ye have not chosen me,\" He says, \"but I have chosen you.\" Grace such as that is ineffable. For what were we so long as Christ had not yet chosen us, and we were therefore still destitute of love? For he who hath chosen Him, how can he love Him? Were we, think you, in that condition which is sung of in the psalm: \"I had rather be an abject in the house of the Lord, than dwell in the tents of wickedness\"?[fn-29-P2985_1697298:11-nf] Certainly not. What were we then, but sinful and lost? We had not yet come to believe on Him, in order to lead to His choosing us; for if it were those who already believed that He chose, then was He chosen Himself, prior to His choosing. But how could He say, \"Ye have not chosen me,\" save only because His mercy anticipated us?[fn-29-P2986_1697649:12-nf] Here surely is at fault the vain reasoning of those who defend the foreknowledge of God in opposition to His grace, and with this view declare that we were chosen before the foundation of the world,[fn-29-P2987_1697866:13-nf] because God foreknew that we should be good, but not that He Himself would make us good. So says not He, who declares, \"Ye have not chosen me.\" For had Hechosen us on the ground that He foreknew that we should be good, then would He also have foreknown that we would not be the first to make choice of Him. For in no other way could we possibly be good: unless, forsooth, one could be called good who has never made good his choice. What was it then that He chose in those who were not good? For they were not chosen because of their goodness, inasmuch as they could not be good without being chosen. Otherwise grace is no more grace, if we maintain the priority of merit. Such, certainly, is the election of grace, whereof the apostle says: \"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.\" To which he adds: \"And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-29-P2988_1698826:14-nf] Listen, thou ungrateful one, listen: \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.\" Not that thou mayest say, I am chosen because I already believed. For if thou wert believing in Him, then hadst thou already chosen Him. But listen: \"Ye have not chosen me.\" Not that thou mayest say, Before I believed I was already doing good works, and therefore was I chosen. For what good work can be prior to faith, when the apostle says, \"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin\"?[fn-29-P2989_1699311:15-nf] What, then, are we to say on hearing such words, \"Ye have not chosen me,\" but that we were evil, and were chosen in order that we might be good through the grace of Him who chose us? For it is not by grace, if merit preceded: but it is of grace: and therefore that grace did not find, but effected the merit.","title":"Tractate LXXXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_92_tractate_lxxxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. But that world which God is in Christ reconciling unto Himself, which is saved by Christ, and has all its sins freely pardoned by Christ, has been chosen out of the world that is hostile, condemned, and defiled. For out of that mass, which has all perished in Adam, are formed the vessels of mercy, whereof that world of reconciliation is composed, that is hated by the world which belongeth to the vessels of wrath that are formed out of the same mass and fitted to destruction.[fn-30-P3006_1705905:7-nf] Finally, after saying, \"If ye were of the world, the world would love its own,\" He immediately added, \"But because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\" And so these men were themselves also of that world, and, that they might no longer be of it, were chosen out of it, through no merit of their own, for no good works of theirs had preceded; and not by nature, which through free-will had become totally corrupted at its source: but gratuitously, that is, of actual grace. For He who chose the world out of the world, effected for Himself, instead of finding, what He should choose: for \"there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.

And then He expressly declares what they were to suffer: \"They shall put you out of the synagogues.\" But what harm was it for the apostles to be expelled from the Jewish synagogues, as if they were not to separate themselves therefrom, although no one expelled them? Doubtless He meant to announce with reprobation, that the Jews would refuse to receive Christ, from whom they as certainly would refuse to withdraw; and so it would come to pass that the latter, who could not exist without Him, would also be cast out along with Him by those who would not have Him as their place of abode. For certainly, as there was no other people of God than that seed of Abraham, they would, had they only acknowledged and received Christ, have remained as the natural branches in the olive tree;[fn-31-P3116_1749069:5-nf] nor would the churches of Christ have been different from the synagogues of the Jews, for they would have been one and the same, had they also desired to abide in Him. But having refused, what remained but that, continuing themselves out of Christ, they put out of the synagogues those who would not abandon Christ? For having received the Holy Spirit, and so become His witnesses, they would certainly not belong to the class of whom it is said: \"Many of the chief rulers of the Jews believed on Him; but for fear of the Jews they dared not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.\"[fn-31-P3117_1749749:6-nf] And so they believed on Him, but not in the way He wished them to believe when He said: \"How can ye believe, who expect honor one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?\"[fn-31-P3118_1749964:7-nf] It is, therefore, with those disciples who so believe in Him, that, filled with the Holy Spirit, or, in other words, with the gift of divine grace, they no longer belong to those who, \"ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going about to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God;\"[fn-31-P3119_1750303:8-nf] nor to those of whom it is said, \"They loved the praise of men more than the praise of God:\" that the prophecy harmonizes, which finds its fulfillment in their own case: \"They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of Thy countenance: and in Thy name shall they rejoice all the day; and in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted: for Thou art the glory of their strength.\"[fn-31-P3120_1750685:9-nf] Rightly enough is it said to such, \"They shall cast you out of the synagogues;\" that is, they who \"have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge;\" because, \"ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own,\"[fn-31-P3121_1750945:10-nf] they expel those who are exalted, not in their own righteousness, but in God's, and have no cause to be ashamed at being expelled by men, since He is the glory of their strength.","title":"Tractate XCIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_98_tractate_xciii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. Such, then, is the meaning of these words: \"They will put you out of the synagogues;\" but have no fear of solitude: inasmuch as, when separated from their assembly, you will assemble so many in my name, that they, in very fear lest the temple, that was with them, and all the sacraments of the old law, should be deserted, will slay you: actually, in thus shedding your blood, full of the notion that they are doing God service. An illustration surely of the apostle's words, \"They have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge;\"[fn-31-P3128_1755843:15-nf] when they imagine that they are doing God service in slaying His servants. Appalling mistake! Is it thus thou wouldst please God by striking down the God-pleaser; and is the living temple of God by thy blows laid level with the ground, that God's temple of stone may not be deserted? Accursed blindness! But it is in part that it has happened to Israel, that the fullness of the Gentiles might come in: in part, I say, and not totally, has it happened. For not all, but only some of the branches have been broken off, that the wild olive might be ingrafted.[fn-31-P3129_1756417:16-nf] For just at the time when the disciples of Christ, filled with the Holy Spirit, were speaking in the tongues of all nations, and performing many divine miracles, and scattering divine utterances on every side, Christ, even though slain, was so beloved, that His disciples, when expelled from the congregations of the Jews, gathered into a congregation of their own a vast multitude of those very Jews, and had no fear of being left to solitude.[fn-31-P3130_1756884:17-nf] hereupon, accordingly, the others, reprobate and blind, being inflamed with wrath, and having a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, and believing that they were doing God service, put them to death. But He, who was slain for them, gathered those together; just as He had also, before He was slain, instructed them in what was to happen, lest their minds, left ignorant and unprepared, should be cast into trouble by evils, however transient, that were unexpected and unprovided for; but rather by knowing of them beforehand, and sustaining them with patience, might be led onward to everlasting blessing. For that such was the cause of His making these announcements to them beforehand, is shown also by His words that followed: \"But these things have I told you, that, when their time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.\" Their hour was an hour of darkness, a midnight hour. But the Lord commanded His loving-kindness in the daytime, and made them sing of it in the night:[fn-31-P3131_1757902:18-nf] when the Jewish night threw no confusion of darkness into the day of the Christians, separated as it was from themselves; and when that which could slay the flesh had no power to darken their faith.","title":"Tractate XCIII.","author":"Augustine"}]
