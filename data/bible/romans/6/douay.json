{"verses":["What shall we say, then?  Shall we continue in sin, that grace may\nabound?","God forbid!  For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any\nlonger therein?","Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are\nbaptized in his death?","For we are buried together with him by baptism into death:  that,\nas Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also\nmay walk in newness of life.","For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,\nwe shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.","Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the\nbody of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no\nlonger.","For he that is dead is justified from sin.","Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also\ntogether with Christ.","Knowing that Christ, rising again from the dead, dieth now no\nmore.  Death shall no more have dominion over him.","For in that he died to sin, he died once:  but in that he liveth,\nhe liveth unto God.","So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive unto\nGod, in Christ Jesus our Lord.","Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey\nthe lusts thereof.","Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto\nsin:  but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the\ndead; and your members as instruments of justice unto God.","For sin shall not have dominion over you:  for you are not under\nthe law, but under grace.","What then?  Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but\nunder grace?  God forbid!","Know you not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey,\nhis servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death or\nof obedience unto justice.","But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin but have\nobeyed from the heart unto that form of doctrine into which you have\nbeen delivered.","Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.","I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh.\nFor as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity,\nunto iniquity:  so now yield your members to serve justice, unto\nsanctification.","For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to\njustice.","What fruit therefore had you then in those things of which you\nare now ashamed?  For the end of them is death.","But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, you\nhave your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting.","For the wages of sin is death.  But the grace of God, life\neverlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord."]}
