{"verses":["Let every soul be subject to higher powers.  For there is no power\nbut from God:  and those that are ordained of God.","Therefore, he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of\nGod.  And they that resist purchase to themselves damnation.","For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.\nWilt thou then not be afraid of the power?  Do that which is good:  and\nthou shalt have praise from the same.","For he is God's minister to thee, for good.  But if thou do that\nwhich is evil, fear:  for he beareth not the sword in vain.  For he is\nGod's minister:  an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.","Wherefore be subject of necessity:  not only for wrath, but also\nfor conscience' sake.","For therefore also you pay tribute.  For they are the ministers of\nGod, serving unto this purpose.","Render therefore to all men their dues.  Tribute, to whom tribute\nis due:  custom, to whom custom:  fear, to whom fear:  honour, to whom\nhonour.","Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.  For he that loveth\nhis neighbour hath fulfilled the law.","For:  Thou shalt not commit adultery:  Thou shalt not kill:  Thou\nshalt not steal:  Thou shalt not bear false witness:  Thou shalt not\ncovet.  And if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this\nword:  Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.","The love of our neighbour worketh no evil.  Love therefore is the\nfulfilling of the law.","And that, knowing the season, that it is now the hour for us to\nrise from sleep.  For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.","The night is passed And the day is at hand.  Let us, therefore\ncast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.","Let us walk honestly, as in the day:  not in rioting and\ndrunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and\nenvy.","But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ:  and make not provision for\nthe flesh in its concupiscences."]}
