{"verses":["I speak the truth in Christ:  I lie not, my conscience bearing me\nwitness in the Holy Ghost:","That I have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart.","For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my\nbrethren:  who are my kinsmen according to the flesh:","Who are Israelites:  to whom belongeth the adoption as of children\nand the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the\nservice of God and the promises:","Whose are the fathers and of whom is Christ, according to the\nflesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever.  Amen.","Not as though the word of God hath miscarried.  For all are not\nIsraelites that are of Israel.","Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children:  but\nin Isaac shall thy seed be called.","That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh are\nthe children of God:  but they that are the children of the promise are\naccounted for the seed.","For this is the word of promise:  According to this time will I\ncome.  And Sara shall have a son.","And not only she.  But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of\nIsaac our father.","For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or\nevil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand):","Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her:  The\nelder shall serve the younger.","As it is written:  Jacob I have loved:  but Esau I have hated.","What shall we say then?  Is there injustice with God?  God forbid!","For he saith to Moses:  I will have mercy on whom I will have\nmercy.  And I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.","So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,\nbut of God that sheweth mercy.","For the scripture saith to Pharao:  To this purpose have I raised\nthee, that I may shew my power in thee and that my name may be declared\nthroughout all the earth.","Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will.  And whom he will, he\nhardeneth.","Thou wilt say therefore to me:  Why doth he then find fault?  For\nwho resisteth his will?","O man, who art thou that repliest against God?  Shall the thing\nformed say to him that formed it:  Why hast thou made me thus?","Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to\nmake one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?","What if God, willing to shew his wrath and to make his power\nknown, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for\ndestruction,","That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of\nmercy which he hath prepared unto glory?","Even us, whom also he hath called, not only of the Jews but also\nof the Gentiles.","As in Osee he saith:  I will call that which was not my people, my\npeople; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not\nobtained mercy; one that hath obtained mercy.","And it shalt be in the place where it was said unto them:  you are\nnot my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.","And Isaias cried out concerning Israel:  If the number of the\nchildren of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.","For he shall finish his word and cut it short in justice:  because\na short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.","And Isaias foretold:  Unless the Lord of Sabbath had left us a\nseed, we had been made as Sodom and we had been like unto Gomorrha.","What then shall we say?  That the Gentiles who followed not after\njustice have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.","But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come\nunto the law of justice.","Why so?  Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of\nworks.  For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.","As it is written:  Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and a\nrock of scandal.  And whosoever believeth in him shall not be\nconfounded."]}
