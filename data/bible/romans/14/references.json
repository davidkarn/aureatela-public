With all this, no one is pressed to endure hardships for which he is unfit; nothing is imposed on any one against his will; nor is he condemned by the rest because he confesses himself too feeble to imitate them: for they bear in mind how strongly Scripture enjoins charity on all: they bear in mind \"To the pure all things are pure,\"[fn-5-P539_241192:98-nf] and \"Not that which entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out of it.\"[fn-5-P540_241302:99-nf] Accordingly, all their endeavors are concerned not about the rejection of kinds of food as polluted, but about the subjugation of inordinate desire and the maintenance of brotherly love. They remember, \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them;\"[fn-5-P541_241612:100-nf] and again, \"Neither if we eat shall we abound, nor if we refrain from eating shall we be in want;\"[fn-5-P542_241733:101-nf] and, above all, this: \"It is good, my brethren, not to eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother is offended;\" for this passage shows that love is the end to be aimed at in all these things. \"For one man,\" he says, \"believes that he can eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. He that eateth, let him not despise him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath approved him. Who art thou that thou shouldest judge another man's servant? To his own master he stands or fails; but he shall stand: for God is able to make him to stand.\" And a little after: \"He that eateth, to the Lord he eateth, and giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.\" And also in what follows: \"So every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not, then, any more judge one another: but judge this rather, that ye place no stumbling-block, or cause of offence, in the way of a brother. I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing common in itself: but to him that thinketh anything to be common, to him it is common.\" Could he have shown better that it is not in the things we eat, but in the mind, that there is a power able to pollute it, and therefore that even those who are fit to think lightly of these things, and know perfectly that they are not polluted if they take any food in mental superiority, without being gluttons, should still have regard to charity?

But, you reply, the apostle says, \"It is good, brethren, neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine.\"[fn-6-P646_298668:13-nf] No one denies that this is good, provided that it is for the end already mentioned, of which it is said,\" Make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof;\"[fn-6-P647_298857:14-nf] or for the ends pointed out by the apostle, namely, either to check the appetite, which is apt to go to a more wild and uncontrollable excess in these things than in others, or lest a brother should be offended, or lest the weak should hold fellowship with an idol. For at the time when the apostle wrote, the flesh of sacrifices was often sold in the market. And because wine, too, was used in libations to the gods of the Gentiles, many weaker brethren, accustomed to purchase such things, preferred to abstain entirely from flesh and wine rather than run the risk of having fellowship, as they considered it, with idols, even ignorantly. And, for their sakes, even those who were stronger, and had faith enough to see the insignificance of these things, knowing that nothing is unclean except from an evil conscience, and holding by the saying of the Lord, \"Not that which entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out of it,\"[fn-6-P648_299826:15-nf] still, lest these weaker brethren should stumble, were bound to abstain from these things. And this is not a mere theory, but is clearly taught in the epistles of the apostle himself. For you are in the habit of quoting only the words, \"It is good, brethren, neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine,\" without adding what follows, \"nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended or is made weak.\" These words show the intention of the apostle in giving the admonition.","title":"On the Morals of the Manichaeans.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_11_the_epistle_of_polycarp_to_the_philippians","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And let the presbyters be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those that wander, visiting all the sick, and not neglecting the widow, the orphan, or the poor, but always \"providing for that which is becoming in the sight of God and man; \"[fn-8-P828_152914:38-nf] abstaining from all wrath, respect of persons, and unjust judgment; keeping far off from all covetousness, not quickly crediting [an evil report] against any one, not severe in judgment, as knowing that we are all under a debt of sin.

For wine is the first weapon used by demons against the young. Greed does not shake, nor pride puff up, nor ambition infatuate so much as this. Other vices we easily escape, but this enemy is shut up within us, and wherever we go we carry him with us. Wine and youth between them kindle the fire of sensual pleasure. Why do we throw oil on the flame-why do we add fresh fuel to a miserable body which is already ablaze. Paul, it is true, says to Timothy \"drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and for thine often infirmities.\"[fn-6-P656_126857:393-nf] But notice the reasons for which the permission is given, to cure an aching stomach and a frequent infirmity. And lest we should indulge ourselves too much on the score of our ailments, he commands that but little shall be taken; advising rather as a physician than as an apostle (though, indeed, an apostle is a spiritual physician). He evidently feared that Timothy might succumb to weakness, and might prove unequal to the constant moving to and fro involved in preaching the Gospel. Besides, he remembered that he had spoken of \"wine wherein is excess,\"[fn-6-P657_127436:394-nf] and had said, \"it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine.\"[fn-6-P658_127522:395-nf] Noah drank wine and became intoxicated; but living as he did in the rude age after the flood, when the vine was first planted, perhaps he did not know its power of inebriation. And to let you see the hidden meaning of Scripture in all its fulness (for the word of God is a pearl and may be pierced on every side) after his drunkenness came the uncovering of his body; self-indulgence culminated in lust.[fn-6-P659_127947:396-nf] First the belly is crammed; then the other members are roused.

And, although they may have acted as they did more from a desire of offspring than from love of sinful pleasure-for the human race seemed in danger of extinction-yet they were well aware that the righteous man would not abet their design unless intoxicated. In fact he did not know what he was doing, and his sin was not wilful. Still his error was a grave one, for it made him the father of Moab and Ammon,[fn-6-P661_128719:398-nf] Israel's enemies, of whom it is said: \"Even to the fourteenth generation they shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever.\"[fn-6-P662_128881:399-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"356","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"37.

You have, therefore, Salvina, those to nurse who may well represent to you your absent husband: \"Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is his reward.\"[fn-33-P3354_879844:2434-nf] In the place of one husband you have received two children, and thus your affection has more objects than before. All that was due to him you can give to them. Temper grief with love, for if he is gone they are still with you. It is no small merit in God's eyes to bring up children well. Hear the apostle's counsel: \"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.\"[fn-33-P3355_880507:2435-nf] Here you learn the roll of the virtues which God requires of you, what is due to the name of widow which you bear, and by what good deeds you can attain to that second degree of chastity[fn-33-P3356_880730:2436-nf] which is still open to you. Do not be disturbed because the apostle allows none to be chosen as a widow under threescore years old, neither suppose that he intends to reject those who are still young. Believe that you are indeed chosen by him who said to his disciple, \"Let no man despise thy youth,\"[fn-33-P3357_881114:2437-nf] your want of age that is, not your want of continence. If this be not his meaning, all who become widows under threescore years will have to take husbands. He is training a church still untaught in Christ, and making provision for people of all stations but especially for the poor, the charge of whom had been committed to himself and Barnabas.[fn-33-P3358_881484:2438-nf] Thus he wishes only those to be supported by the exertions of the church who cannot labour with their own hands, and who are widows indeed,[fn-33-P3359_881658:2439-nf] approved by their years and by their lives. The faults of his children made Eli the priest an offence to God. On the other hand He is appeased by the virtues of such as \"continue in faith and charity and holiness with chastity.\"[fn-33-P3360_881913:2440-nf] \"O Timothy,\" cries the apostle, \"keep thyself pure.\"[fn-33-P3361_882029:2441-nf] Far be it from me to suspect you capable of doing anything wrong; still it is only a kindness to admonish one whose youth and opulence lead her into temptation. You must take what I am going to say as addressed not to you but to your girlish years. A widow \"that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-33-P3362_882361:2442-nf] So speaks the \"chosen vessel\"[fn-33-P3363_882413:2443-nf] and the words are brought out from his treasure who could boldly say: \"Do ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?\"[fn-33-P3364_882552:2444-nf] Yet they are the words of one who in his own person admitted the weakness of the human body, saying: \"The good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not that I do.\"[fn-33-P3365_882760:2445-nf] And again: Therefore \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway.\"[fn-33-P3366_882941:2446-nf] If Paul is afraid, which of us can venture to be confident? If David the friend of God and Solomon who loved God[fn-33-P3367_883078:2447-nf] were overcome like other men, if their fall is meant to warn us and their penitence to lead us to salvation, who in this slippery life can be sure of not falling? Never let pheasants be seen upon your table, or plump turtledoves or black cock from Ionia, or any of those birds so expensive that they fly away with the largest properties. And do not fancy that you eschew meat diet when you reject pork, hare, and venison and the savoury flesh of other quadrupeds.[fn-33-P3368_883564:2448-nf] It is not the number of feet that makes the difference but delicacy of flavour. I know that the apostle has said: \"every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-33-P3369_883906:2449-nf] But the same apostle says: \"it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine,\"[fn-33-P3370_884009:2450-nf] and in another place: \"be not drunk with wine wherein is excess.\"[fn-33-P3371_884098:2451-nf] \"Every creature of God is good\"-the precept is intended for those who are careful how they may please their husbands.[fn-33-P3372_884237:2452-nf] Let those feed on flesh who serve the flesh, whose bodies boil with desire, who are tied to husbands, and who set their hearts on having offspring.

If all the members of my body were to be converted into tongues, and if each of my limbs were to be gifted with a human voice, I could still do no justice to the virtues of the holy and venerable Paula. Noble in family, she was nobler still in holiness; rich formerly in this world's goods, she is now more distinguished by the poverty that she has embraced for Christ. Of the stock of the Gracchi and descended from the Scipios, the heir and representative of that Paulus whose name she bore, the true and legitimate daughter of that Martia Papyria who was mother to Africanus, she yet preferred Bethlehem to Rome, and left her palace glittering with gold to dwell in a mud cabin.

For \"all live unto\" God,[fn-38-P3845_1040663:2730-nf] and they who return unto the Lord are still to be reckoned members of his family. We have lost her, it is true, but the heavenly mansions have gained her; for as long as she was in the body she was absent from the Lord[fn-38-P3846_1040904:2731-nf] and would constantly complain with tears:-\"Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar; my soul hath been this long time a pilgrim.\"[fn-38-P3847_1041086:2732-nf] It was no wonder that she sobbed out that even she was in darkness (for this is the meaning of the word Kedar) seeing that, according to the apostle, \"the world lieth in the evil one;\"[fn-38-P3848_1041337:2733-nf] and that, \"as its darkness is, so is its light;\"[fn-38-P3849_1041409:2734-nf] and that \"the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.\"[fn-38-P3850_1041524:2735-nf] She would frequently exclaim: \"I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were,\"[fn-38-P3851_1041642:2736-nf] and again, I desire \"to depart and to be with Christ.\"[fn-38-P3852_1041721:2737-nf] As often too as she was troubled with bodily weakness (brought on by incredible abstinence and by redoubled fastings), she would be heard to say: \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway;\"[fn-38-P3853_1042029:2738-nf] and \"It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine;\"[fn-38-P3854_1042110:2739-nf] and \"I humbled my soul with fasting;\"[fn-38-P3855_1042171:2740-nf] and \"thou wilt make all\" my \"bed in\" my \"sickness;\"[fn-38-P3856_1042246:2741-nf] and \"Thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.\"[fn-38-P3857_1042351:2742-nf] And when the pain which she bore with such wonderful patience darted through her, as if she saw the heavens opened[fn-38-P3858_1042489:2743-nf] she would say \"Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away and be at rest.\"[fn-38-P3859_1042607:2744-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1335","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9.

For if you set out upon a road that is new to you without a guide, you are sure to turn aside immediately either to the right or to the left, to lay yourself open to the assaults of error, to go too far or else not far enough, to weary yourself with running too fast or to loiter by the way and to fall asleep. In loneliness pride quickly creeps upon a man: if he has fasted for a little while and has seen no one, he fancies himself a person of some note; forgetting who he is, whence he comes, and whither he goes, he lets his thoughts riot within and outwardly indulges in rash speech. Contrary to the apostle's wish he judges another man's servants,[fn-48-P4823_1321636:3439-nf] puts forth his hand to grasp whatever his appetite desires, sleeps as long he pleases, fears nobody, does what he likes, fancies everyone inferior to himself, spends more of his time in cities than in his cell, and, while with the brothers he affects to be retiring, rubs shoulders with the crowd in the streets. What then, you will say? Do I condemn a solitary life? By no means: in fact I have often commended it. But I wish to see the monastic schools turn out soldiers who have no fear of the rough training of the desert, who have exhibited the spectacle of a holy life for a considerable time, who have made themselves last that they might be first, who have not been overcome by hunger or satiety, whose joy is in poverty, who teach virtue by their garb and mien, and who are too conscientious to invent-as some silly men do-monstrous stories of struggles with demons, designed to magnify their heroes in the eyes of the crowd and before all to extort money from it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":14,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1517","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"\"A most trying time has come upon us[fn-54-P5483_1516915:3898-nf] in which I have found it better to hold my peace than to speak.

Let us now turn our attention to the next best advice, in regard of human infirmity; admonished hereto by the examples of certain, who, when an opportunity for the practice of Continence has been offered them, by divorce, or by the decease of the husband, have not only thrown away the opportunity of attaining so great a good, but not even in their remarriage have chosen to be mindful of the rule that \"above all[fn-8-P840_200607:1-nf] they marry in the Lord.\" And thus my mind has been thrown into confusion, in the fear that, having exhorted you myself to perseverance in single husbandhood and widowhood, I may now, by the mention of precipitate[fn-8-P841_200864:2-nf] marriages, put \"an occasion of falling\"[fn-8-P842_200919:3-nf] in your way. But if you are perfect in wisdom, you know, of course, that the course which is the more useful is the course which you must keep. But, inasmuch as that course is difficult, and not without its embarrassments,[fn-8-P843_201292:4-nf] and on this account is the highest aim of (widowed) life, I have paused somewhat (in my urging you to it); nor would there have been any causes for my recurring to that point also in addressing you, had I not by this time taken up a still graver solicitude. For the nobler is the continence of the flesh which ministers to widowhood, the more pardonable a thing it seems if it be not persevered in. For it is then when things are difficult that their pardon is easy. But in as far as marrying \"in the Lord\" is permissible, as being within our power, so far more culpable is it not to observe that which you can observe. Add to this the fact that the apostle, with regard to widows and the unmarried, advises them to remain permanently in that state, when he says, \"But I desire all to persevere in (imitation of) my example: \"[fn-8-P844_202138:5-nf] but touching marrying \"in the Lord,\" he no longer advises, but plainly[fn-8-P845_202229:6-nf] bids.[fn-8-P846_202306:7-nf] Therefore in this case especially, if we do not obey, we run a risk, because one may with more impunity neglect an \"advice\" than an \"order; \"in that the former springs from counsel, and is proposed to the will (for acceptance or rejection): the other descends from authority, and is bound to necessity.

He raises the objection that when God gave his second blessing, permission was granted to eat flesh, which had not in the first benediction been allowed.

Whence the apostle withal judges, and that in a case of fornication,[fn-13-P1328_361909:41-nf] that \"such a man must be surrendered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; \"[fn-13-P1329_362041:42-nf] chiding them likewise because \"brethren\" were not \"judged at the bar of the saints: \"[fn-13-P1330_362145:43-nf] for he goes on and says, \"To what (purpose is it) for me to judge those who are without? \"\"But you remit, in order that remission may be granted you by God.\" The sins which are (thus) cleansed are such as a man may have committed against his brother, not against God. We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

At length we have arrived at the question of food, and are confronted by our third difficulty. \"All things were created to serve for the use of mortal men.' And as man, a rational animal, in a sense the owner and tenant of the world, is subject to God, and worships his Creator, so all things living were created either for the food of men, or for clothing, or for tilling the earth, or conveying the fruits thereof, or to be the companions of man, and hence, because they are man's[fn-66-P6659_2087831:67-nf] helpers, they have their name jumenta.[fn-66-P6660_2087952:68-nf] `What is man,' says David, `that thou art mindful of him?

Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thine hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field: the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.' Granted, he says, that the ox was created for ploughing, the horse for riding, the dog for watching, goats for their milk, sheep for their fleeces. What is the use of swine if we may not eat their flesh? of roes, stags, fallow-deer, boars, hares, and such like game? of geese, wild and tame? of wild ducks and[fn-66-P6661_2088738:69-nf] fig-peckers? of woodcocks? of coots? of thrushes? Why do hens run about our houses? If they are not eaten, all these creatures were created by God for nothing. But what need is there of argument when Scripture clearly teaches that every moving creature, like herbs and vegetables, were given to us for food, and the Apostle cries aloud[fn-66-P6662_2089103:70-nf] `All things are clean to the clean, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving,' and[fn-66-P6663_2089247:71-nf] tells us that men will come in the last days, forbidding to marry, and to eat meats, which God created for use? The Lord himself was called by the Pharisees a wine-bibber and a glutton, the friend of publicans and sinners, because he did not decline the invitation of Zacchaeus to dinner, and went to the marriage-feast. But it is a different matter if, as you may foolishly contend, he went to the dinner intending to fast, and after the manner of deceivers said, I eat this, not that; I do not drink the wine which I created out of water. He did not make water, but wine, the type of his blood. After the resurrection he ate a fish and part of a honey-comb, not sesame nuts and service-berries. The apostle, Peter, did not wait like a Jew for the stars to peep, but went upon the house-top to dine at the sixth hour. Paul in the ship broke bread, not dried figs. When Timothy's stomach was out of order, he advised him to drink wine, not perry.

For both the flood and the fire from heaven found fulness as well as marriage ready for destruction. Nor need we wonder if the Apostle commands that everything sold in the market be bought and eaten, since with idolaters, and with those who still ate in the temples of the idols meats offered to idols as such, it passed for the highest abstinence to abstain only from food eaten by the Gentiles.

But what is the good of calling a[fn-68-P6811_2158250:195-nf] one-eyed man Old One-eye, and of showing the inconsistency of an assailant, when we have to refute a whole series of statements? That the sheep and the goats on the right hand and on the left are the two classes of the righteous and the wicked, I do not deny. That a good tree does not bring forth evil fruit, nor an evil one good fruit, no one doubts. The ten virgins also, wise and foolish, we divide into good and bad. We are not ignorant that at the deluge the righteous were delivered, and sinners overwhelmed with the waters. That at Sodom and Gomorrha the just man was rescued, while the sinners were consumed by fire, is clear to everyone. We are also aware that Egypt was stricken with the ten plagues, and that Israel was saved. Even little children in our schools sing how the righteous passed through the Red Sea, and Pharaoh with his host was drowned. That six hundred thousand fell in the desert because they were unbelieving, and that two only entered the land of promise, is taught by Scripture; and so is the rest of your description of the two classes, good and bad, down to the labourers in the vineyard. But what are we to think of your assertion, that because there is a division into good and bad, the good, or the bad it may be, are not distinguished one from another, and that it makes no difference whether one is a ram in the flock or a poor little sheep? whether the sheep have the first or the second fleece? whether the flock is diseased and covered with the scab, or full of life and vigour?[fn-68-P6812_2159820:196-nf] especially when by the authoritative utterances of His own prophet Ezekiel God clearly points out the difference between flock and flock of His rational sheep, saying, \"Behold I judge between cattle and cattle, and between the rams and the he-goats, and between the fat cattle and the lean. Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, until they were scattered abroad.\" And that we might know what the cattle were, He immediately added:[fn-68-P6813_2160368:197-nf] \"Ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men.\" Will Paul and that penitent who had lain with his father's wife be on an equality, because the latter repented and was received into the Church: and shall the offender because he is with him on the right hand shine with the same glory as the Apostle?How is it then that tares and wheat grow side by side in the same field until the harvest, that is the end of the world?What is the significance of good and bad fish being contained in the Gospel net? Why, in Noah's ark, the type of the Church, are there different animals with different abodes according to their rank?Why standeth the queen upon the Lord's right hand, in raiment of wrought gold, in a vesture of gold? Why had Joseph, representing Christ, a coat of many colours? Why does the Apostle say to the Romans:[fn-68-P6814_2161212:198-nf] \"According as God had dealt to each man a measure of faith. For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office: so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching; or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence,\" and so on. And elsewhere:[fn-68-P6815_2161855:199-nf] \"One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.\" To the Corinthians he says:[fn-68-P6816_2162031:200-nf] \"I have planted, Apollos watered: but God gave the increase. So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. For we are labourers together with God, ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" And again elsewhere:[fn-68-P6817_2162457:201-nf] \"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master-builder I laid a foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay, than thai which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if any man buildeth on the foundation, gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble: each man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall reveal it, because it is revealed in fire: and the fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.\" If the man whose work is burnt and is to suffer the loss of his labour, while he himself is saved, yet not without proof of fire: it follows that if a man's work remains which he has built upon the foundation, he will be saved without probation by fire, and consequently a difference is established between one degree of salvation and another. Again in another place be says:[fn-68-P6818_2163584:202-nf] \"Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.\" Would you be assured that between one steward and another there is a great difference (I am not speaking of bad and good, but of the good themselves who stand on the right hand)? then listen to the sequel:[fn-68-P6819_2163994:203-nf] \"Know ye not that they which minister about the sacrifices, eat of the sacrifices, and they which wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? Even so did the Lord ordain that they which proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. But I have used none of these things: and I wrote not these things that it may be so done in my case: for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel. For if l do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a steward-ship intrusted to me. What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. For though I was free from all men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that [ might gain the more.\" You surely cannot say that men commit sin by living by the Gospel, and partaking of the sacrifices. Of course not. The Lord himself made the rule that they who preach the Gospel, should live by the Gospel. But an Apostle who does not abuse this freedom, but labours with his hands that he may not be a burden to anyone, and toils. night and day and ministers to his companions of course does this, that for his greater toil he may receive a greater reward.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":14,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_12_against_vigilantius","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"7. As to the question of tapers, however, we do not, as you in vain misrepresent us, light them in the daytime, but by their solace we would cheer the darkness of the night, and watch for the dawn, lest we should be blind like you and sleep in darkness.

Once upon a thee even the Apostles[fn-69-P6964_2238064:25-nf] pleaded that the ointment was wasted, but they were rebuked by the voice of the Lord. Christ did not need the ointment, nor do martyrs need the light of tapers; and yet that woman poured out the ointment in honour of Christ, and her heart's devotion was accepted. All those who light these tapers have their reward according to their faith, as the Apostle says:[fn-69-P6965_2238459:26-nf] \"Let every one abound in his own meaning.\" Do you call men of this sort idolaters? I do not deny, that all of us who believe in Christ have passed from the error of idolatry. For we are not born Christians, but become Christians by being born again. And because we formerly worshipped idols, does it follow that we ought not now to worship God lest we seem to pay like honour to Him and to idols? In the one case respect was paid to idols, and therefore the ceremony is to be abhorred; in the other the martyrs are venerated, and the same ceremony is therefore to be allowed. Throughout the whole Eastern Church, even when there are no relics of the martyrs, whenever the Gospel is to be read the candles are lighted, although the dawn may be reddening the sky, not of course to scatter the darkness, but by way of evidencing our joy.[fn-69-P6966_2239365:27-nf] And accordingly the virgins in the Gospel always have their lamps lighted.

He is the first-born from the dead, Who first by Himself loosed the pains of death[fn-14-P1478_825316:28-nf] , that He might also make that birth of the resurrection a way for all men[fn-14-P1479_825409:29-nf] . Again, He becomes \"the first-born among many brethren,\" Who is born before us by the new birth of regeneration in water, for the travail whereof the hovering of the Dove was the midwife, whereby He makes those who share with Him in the like birth to be His own brethren, and becomes the first-born of those who after Him are born of water and of the Spirit[fn-14-P1480_825829:30-nf] : and to speak briefly, as there are in us three births, whereby human nature is quickened, one of the body, another in the sacrament of regeneration, another by that resurrection of the dead for which we look, He is first-born in all three:-of the twofold regeneration which is wrought by two (by baptism and by the resurrection), by being Himself the leader in each of them; while it, the flesh He is first-born, as having first and alone devised in His own case that birth unknown to nature, which no one in the many generations of men had originated. If these passages, then, have been rightly understood, neither will the signification of the \"creation,\" of which He is first-born, be unknown to as. For we recognize a twofold creation of our nature, the first that whereby we were made, the second that whereby we were made anew. But there would have been no need of the second creation had we not made the first unavailing by our disobedience. Accordingly, when the first creation had waxed old and vanished away, it was needful that there should be a new creation in Christ, (as the Apostle says, who asserts that we should no longer see in the second creation any trace of that which has waxed old, saying, \"Having put off the old man with his deeds and his lusts, put on the new man which is created according to God[fn-14-P1481_827405:31-nf] ,\" and \"If any man be in Christ,\" he says, \"he is a new creature: the old things are passed away, behold all things are become new[fn-14-P1482_827575:32-nf] :\") -for the maker of human nature at the first and afterwards is one and the same. Then He took dust from the earth and formed man: again, He took dust from the Virgin, and did not merely form man, but formed man about Himself: then, He created; afterwards, He was created: then, the Word made flesh; afterwards, the Word became flesh, that He might change our flesh to spirit, by being made partaker with us in flesh and blood. Of this new creation therefore in Christ, which He Himself began, He was called the first-born, being the first-fruits of all, both of those begotten into life, and of those quickened by resurrection of the dead, \"that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living[fn-14-P1483_828299:33-nf] ,\" and might sanctify the whole lump[fn-14-P1484_828354:34-nf] by means of its first-fruits in Himself. Now that the character of \"first-born\" does not apply to the Son in respect of His pre-temporal existence the appellation of \"Only-begotten\" testifies. For he who is truly only-begotten has no brethren, for bow could any one be only-begotten if numbered among brethren? but as He is called God and man, Son of God and Son of man,-for He has the form of God and the form of a servant[fn-14-P1485_828800:35-nf] , being some things according to His supreme nature, becoming other things in His dispensation of love to man,-so too, being the Only-begotten God, He becomes the first-born of all creation,-the Only-begotten, He that is in the bosom of the Father, yet, among the e who are saved by the new creation, both becoming and being called the first born of the creation. But if, as heresy will have it, He is called first-born because He was made before the rest of the creation, the name does not agree with what they maintain concerning the Only-begotten God. For they do not say this,-that the Son and the universe were from the Father in like manner,-but they say, that the Only-begotten God was made by the Father, and that all else was made by the Only-begotten. Therefore on the same ground on which, while they hold that the Son was created, they call God the Father of the created Being, on the same ground, while they say that all things were made by the Only-begotten God, they give Him the name not of the \"first-born\" of the things that were made by Him, but more properly of their \"Father,\" as the same relation existing in both cases towards the things created, logically gives rise to the same appellation. For if God, Who is over all, is not properly called the \"First-born,\" but the Father of the Being He Himself created, the Only-begotten God will surely also be called, by the same reasoning, the \"father,\" and not properly the \"first-born\" of His own creatures, so that the appellation of \"first-born\" will be altogether improper and superfluous, having no place in the heretical conception,","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":14,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"147","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He will perhaps say to this: \"It was not because of his works, but in consequence of his faith, that I said the apostle was worthy of having all those great graces bestowed upon him.

And inasmuch as each is the gift of God (although one is less, and the other greater), he must not extol our righteousness above the praise which is due to Him who justifies us, in such a way as to assign to the lesser of these two gifts the help of divine grace, and to claim the greater one for the human will. And should he consent that we receive love from the grace of God, he must not suppose that any merits of our own preceded our reception of the gift. For what merits could we possibly have had at the time when we loved not God? In order, indeed, that we might receive that love whereby we might love, we were loved while as yet we had no love ourselves.

For the soul and the body, and all the natural endowments which are implanted in the soul and the body, even in the persons of sinful men, are still gifts of God; for it is God who made them, and not they themselves. When it is said, \"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,\" only those things are meant which men themselves do. When men, therefore, do without faith those things which seem to appertain to conjugal chastity, they do them either to please men, whether themselves or others, or to avoid incurring such troubles as are incidental to human nature in those things which they corruptly desire, or to pay service to devils. Sins are not really resigned, but some sins are overpowered by other sins.

But he makes a bad use of this good who uses it bestially, so that his intention is on the gratification of lust, intend of the desire of offspring. Nevertheless, in sundry animals unendowed with reason, as, for instance, in most birds, there is both preserved a certain kind of confederation of pairs, and a social combination of skill in nest-building; and their mutual division of the periods for cherishing their eggs and their alternation in the labor of feeding their young, give them the appearance of so acting, when they mate, as to be intent rather on securing the continuance of their kind than on gratifying lust. Of these two, the one is the likeness of man in a brute; the other, the likeness of the brute in man. With respect, however, to what I ascribed to the nature of marriage, that the male and the female are united together as associates for procreation, and consequently do not defraud each other (forasmuch as every associated state has a natural abhorrence of a fraudulent companion), although even men without faith possess this palpable blessing of nature, yet, since they use it not in faith, they only turn it to evil and sin. In like manner, therefore, the marriage of believers converts to the use of righteousness that carnal concupiscence by which \"the flesh lusteth against the Spirit.\"[fn-38-P3849_1459277:11-nf] For they entertain the firm purpose of generating offspring to be regenerated-that the children who are born of them as \"children of the world\" may be born again and become \"sons of God.\" Wherefore all parents who do not beget children with this intention, this will this purpose, of transferring them from bring members of the first man into being members of Christ, but boast as unbelieving parents over unbelieving children,-however circumspect they be in their cohabitation, studiously limiting it to the begetting of children,-really have no conjugal chastity in themselves. For inasmuch as chastity is a virtue, hating unchastity as its contrary vice, and as all the virtues (even those whose operation is by means of the body) have their seat in the soul, how can the body be in any true sense said to be chaste, when the soul itself is committing fornication against the true God? Now such fornication the holy psalmist censures when he says: \"For, lo, they that are far from Thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from Thee.\"[fn-38-P3850_1460356:12-nf] There is, then, no true chastity, whether conjugal, or vidual, or virginal, except that which devotes itself to true faith. For though consecrated virginity is rightly preferred to marriage, yet what Christian in his sober mind would not prefer catholic Christian women who have been even more than once married, to not only vestals, but also to heretical virgins? So great is the avail of faith, of which the apostle says, \"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin;\"[fn-38-P3851_1460839:13-nf] and of which it is written in the Epistle to the Hebrews, \"Without faith it is impossible to please God.\"[fn-38-P3852_1460964:14-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"3.

Finally, He here commits His sheep to the care of Peter, who loves Him, and thrice confesses that love, and then He states that He wills this very John so to tarry until He comes.[fn-28-P2856_1263485:78-nf] In which utterance, again, He seems to me to have conveyed in a profound and mystical way the fact that this[fn-28-P2857_1263635:79-nf] evangelical stewardship of John's, in which he is borne aloft into the most liquid light of the Word,[fn-28-P2858_1263926:80-nf] where it is possible to behold the equality and unchangeableness of the Trinity, and in which, above all, we see at what a distance from all others in respect of essential character that humanity stands by whose assumption it occurred that the Word was made flesh, cannot be clearly discerned and recognised until the Lord Himself comes. Consequently, it will tarry thus until He comes. At present it will tarry in the faith of believers, but hereafter it will be possible to contemplate it face to face,[fn-28-P2859_1264453:81-nf] when He, our Life, shall appear, and when we shall appear with Him in glory.[fn-28-P2860_1264548:82-nf] But if any one supposes that with man, living, as he still does, in this mortal life, it may be possible for a person to dispel and clear off every obscurity induced by corporeal and carnal fancies, and to attain to the serenest light of changeless truth, and to cleave constantly and unswervingly to that with a mind thoroughly estranged from the course of this present life, that man understands neither what he asks, nor who he is that put such a supposition. Let such an individual rather accept the authority, at once lofty and free from all deceitfulness, which tells us that, as long as we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord, and that we walk by faith find not by sight? And thus, with all perseverance keeping and guarding his faith and hope and charity, let him look forward to the sight which is promised, in accordance with that earnest which we have received of the Holy Ghost, who shall teach us all truth,[fn-28-P2861_1265499:83-nf] when God, who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall also quicken our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us.[fn-28-P2862_1265642:84-nf] But before this body, which is dead by reason of sin, is quickened, it is without doubt corruptible, and presseth down the soul.[fn-28-P2863_1265795:85-nf] And if, in the body, man is ever helped to reach beyond the cloud with which the whole earth is covered,[fn-28-P2864_1265927:86-nf] -that is to say, beyond this carnal darkness with which the whole life of earth is covered,-it is simply as if he were touched with a rapid coruscation, only to sink swiftly into his natural infirmity, the desire surviving by which he may again be excited (to what is evil), and the purity being insufficient to establish him (in what is good). The more, however, any one can do this, the greater is he; while the less he can do so, the less is he. And if the mind of a man has as yet had no such experience-in which mind nevertheless Christ dwells by faith-he ought to strive earnestly to diminish the lusts of this world, and to make an end of them by the exercise of moral virtue, walking, as it were, in the company of these three evangelists with Christ the Mediator. And, with the joy of large hope, let him in faith hold Him who is alway the Son of God, but who, for our sakes, became the Son of man, in order that His eternal power and Godhead might be united with[fn-28-P2865_1266922:87-nf] our weakness and mortality, and, on the basis of what is ours, make a way for us in Himself and to Himself. That a man may be kept from sinning, he should be ruled by Christ the King. If he happens to sin, he may obtain remission from Christ, who is also priest. And thus, nurtured in the exercise of a good conversation and life, and borne out of the atmosphere of earth on the wings of a twofold love, as on a pair of strong pinions, so may he be enlightened by the same Christ, who is also the Word, the Word who was in the beginning, the Word who was with God, and the Word who was God; and although that will still be through a glass darkly, it will be a sublime kind of illumination far superior to every corporeal similitude. Wherefore, although it is the gifts of the active virtue that shine pre-eminent in the first three evangelists, while it is the gift of the contemplative virtue that discerns such subjects, nevertheless, this Gospel of John, in so far as it also is in part, will so tarry until that which is perfect comes.[fn-28-P2866_1267998:88-nf] And to one, indeed, is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.[fn-28-P2867_1268143:89-nf] One man regardeth the day to the Lord;[fn-28-P2868_1268202:90-nf] another receives a clearer draught from the breast of the Lord; another is caught up even to the third heaven, and hears unspeakable words.[fn-28-P2869_1268360:91-nf] But all, as long as they are in the body, are absent from the Lord.[fn-28-P2870_1268450:92-nf] And for all believers living in the good hope, whose names are written in the book of life, there is still in reserve that which is referred to in the words, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.\"[fn-28-P2871_1268684:93-nf] Nevertheless, the greater the advance which a man may make in the apprehension and knowledge of this theme during the time of this absence from the Lord, all the more carefully should he guard against those devilish vices, pride and envy. Let him remember that this very Gospel of John, which urges us so pre-eminently to the contemplation of truth, gives a no less remarkable prominence to the inculcation of the sweet grace of charity. Let him also consider that most true and wholesome precept which is couched in the words, \"The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all.\"[fn-28-P2872_1269287:94-nf] For the evangelist who presents Christ to us in a far loftier strain of teaching than all the others, is also the one in whose narrative the Lord washes the disciples' feet.[fn-28-P2873_1269483:95-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"26. Thus much will suffice to have treated on behalf of true Continence against the Manichees deceitfully continent, lest the fruitful and glorious labor of Continence, when it restrains and curbs the lowest part of us, that is, the body, from immoderate and unlawful pleasures, be believed not healthfully to chasten, but hostilely to persecute. Forsooth the body is indeed different from the nature of the soul, yet is it not alien from the nature of man: for the soul is not made up of body, but yet man is made up of soul and body: and assuredly, whom God frees, He frees the whole man. Whence our Saviour Himself also took upon Him the whole man, having deigned to free in us all that He made. They who hold contrary to this truth, what doth it profit them to restrain lusts?if, that is, they restrain any. What in them can be made clean through Continence, whose such Continence is unclean? and which ought not to be called Continence. Forsooth to hold what they hold is the poison of the devil; but Continence is the gift of God. But as not every one who suffers any thing, or with the greatest endurance suffers any pain whatever, possesses that virtue, which in like manner is the gift of God, and is called Patience; for many endure many torments, in order not to betray either such as are wickedly privy with them in their crimes, or themselves; many in order to satiate glowing lusts, and to obtain, or not to abandon those things, whereunto they are bound by chain of evil love; many on behalf of different and destructive errors, whereby they are strongly held: of all of whom far be it from us to say that they have true patience: thus not every one, who contains in any thing, or who marvellously retrains even the very lusts of the flesh, or mind, is to be said to possess that continence, of the profit and beauty of which we are treating. For certain, what may seem marvellous to say, through incontinence contain themselves: as if a woman were to contain herself from her husband, because she hath sworn this to an adulterer. Certain through injustice, as if spouse yield not to spouse the due of sexual intercourse, because he or she is already able to overcome such appetite of the body.

For does he deny that in baptism all sins are forgiven, because he confesses that there remain frailty and infirmity, whence he says that we sin after baptism and even to the end of this life, having unceasing conflict with the vices of the flesh? Or did he not remember what the apostle said about the Church without spot, that he prescribed that no one ought so to flatter himself in respect of a pure and spotless heart as to trust in his own innocence, and think that no medicine needed to be applied to his wounds? I think that these new heretics may concede to this catholic man that he knew \"that the Holy Spirit even in the old times aided good dispositions;\" nay, even, what they themselves will not allow, that they could not have possessed good dispositions except through the Holy Spirit. I think that Cyprian knew that all the prophets and apostles or saints of any kind soever who pleased the Lord at any time were righteous-\"not in comparison with the wicked,\" as they falsely assert that we say, \"but by the rule of virtue,\" as they boast that they say; although Cyprian says, nevertheless, no one can be without sin, and whoever should assert that he is blameless is either proud or a fool. Nor is it with reference to anything else that he understands the Scripture, \"Who shall boast that he has a pure heart? or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?\"[fn-57-P5753_2261815:103-nf] I think that Cyprian would not have needed to be taught by such as these, what he very well knew, \"that, in the time to come, there would be a reward of good works and a punishment of evil works, but that no one could then perform the commands which here he might have despised;\" and yet he does not understand and assert the Apostle Paul, who was assuredly not a contemner of the divine commands, to have said, \"To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,\"[fn-57-P5754_2262294:104-nf] on any other account, except that he reckoned it the greatest gain after this life no longer to be held in worldly entanglements, no longer to be obnoxious to the sins and vices of the flesh. Therefore the most blessed Cyprian felt, and in the truth of the divine Scriptures saw, that even the life of the apostles themselves, however good, holy, and righteous, suffered some involvements of worldly entanglements, was obnoxious to some sins and vices of the flesh; and that they desired death thatthey might be free from those evils, and that they might attain to that perfect righteousness which would not suffer such things, and which would no more have to be achieved in the way of command merely, but to be received in the way of reward. For not even when that shall have come for which we pray when we say, \"Thy kingdom come,\" will there be in that kingdom of God no righteousness; since the apostle says, \"The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-57-P5755_2263328:105-nf] Certainly these three things are commanded among other divine precepts. Here righteousness is prescribed to us when it is said, \"Do righteousness;\"[fn-57-P5756_2263497:106-nf] peace is prescribed when it is said, \"Have peace among yourselves;\"[fn-57-P5757_2263585:107-nf] joy is prescribed when it is said, \"Rejoice in the Lord always.\"[fn-57-P5758_2263670:108-nf] Let, then, the Pelagians deny that these things shall be in the kingdom of God, where we shall live without end; or let them be so mad, if it appears good, as to contend that righteousness, peace, and joy, will be such there as they are here to the righteous. But if they both shall be, and yet shall not be the same, assuredly here, in respect of the commandment of them, the doing is to be cared for,-there the perfection is to be hoped for in the way of reward; when, not being withheld by any earthly entanglements, and being liable to no sins and vices of the flesh (on account of which the apostle, as Cyprian received this testimony, said that to die would be to him gain), we may perfectly love God, the contemplation of whom will be face to face; we may also perfectly love our neighbour, since, when the thoughts of the heart are made manifest, no suspicion of any evil can disturb any one concerning any one.

Mark's account of John's preaching agrees with the other. The words are, \"There cometh after me He that is mightier than I,\" which amounts to the same thing as \"He that cometh after me is mightier than I.\" There is a difference, however, in what follows, \"The latchets of His shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.\" For it is one thing to bear a person's shoes,-they must, it is evident, have been untied already from the feet of the wearer,-and it is another thing to stoop down and untie the latchet of his shoes. And it follows, since believers cannot think that either of the Evangelists made any mistake or misrepresentation, that the Baptist must have made these two utterances at different times and have meant them to express different things. It is not the case, as some suppose. that the reports refer to the same incident and turned out differently because of a loose-ness of memory as to some of the facts or words. Now it is a great thing to bear the shoes of Jesus, a great thing to stoop down to the bodily features of His mission, to that which took place in some lower region, so as to contemplate His image in the lower sphere, and to untie each difficulty connected with the mystery of His incarnation, such being as it were His shoe-latchets. For the fetter of obscurity is one as the key of knowledge also is one; not even He who is greatest among those born of women is sufficient of Himself to loose such things or to open them, for He who tied and locked at first, He also grants to whom He will to loose His shoe-latchet and to unlock what He has shut. If the passage about the shoes has a mystic meaning we ought not to scorn to consider it. Now I consider that the inhumanisation when the Son of God assumes flesh and bones is one of His shoes, and that the other is the descent to Hades, whatever that Hades be, and the journey with the Spirit to the prison. As to the descent into Hades, we read in the sixteenth Psalm, \"Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades,\" and as for the journey in prison with the Spirit we read in Peter in his Catholic Epistle,[fn-68-P6849_1267986:105-nf] \"Put to death,\" he says, \"in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit; in which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which at one time were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God once waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing.\" He, then, who is able worthily to set forth the meaning of these two journeys is able to untie the latchet of the shoes of Jesus; he, bending down in his mind and going with Jesus as He goes down into Hades, and descending from heaven and the mysteries of Christ's deity to the advent He of necessity made with us when He took on man (as His shoes). Now He who put on man also put on the dead, for[fn-68-P6850_1268674:106-nf] \"for this end Jesus both died and revived, that He might be Lord both of dead and living.\" This is why He put on both living and dead, that is, the inhabitants of the earth and those of Hades, that He might be the Lord of both dead and living. Who, then, is able to stoop down and untie the latchet of such shoes, and having untied them not to let them drop, but by the second faculty he has received to take them up and bear them, by bearing the meaning of them in his memory?","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_13_book_ix_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The impostor Callistus, having ventured on such opinions, established a school of theology in antagonism to the Church, adopting the foregoing system of instruction.

Will not your brother be offended if he sees you sitting in that idol temple?\" Here of course he brings himself in guilty of idolatry; for if reading causes offence, much more does writing. But, since one who turns to idolatry does not thereby become wholly and completely a heathen unless he first denies Christ, he tells us that he said to Christ, as he sat on the judgment seat with his most exalted angel ministers around him, \"If I ever hereafter read or possess any heathen books, I have denied thee,\" and now he not only reads them and possesses them, not only copies them and collates them, but inserts them among the words of Scripture itself, and in discourses intended for the edification of the Church.

We must fear the judgment of the Lord, who says[fn-88-P8895_2286833:25-nf] \"Judge not and ye shall not be judged,\" and again, \"With what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.\" Therefore, though it is really superfluous, I will bring against him a single witness, but one who must prevail, and whom he cannot challenge, that is, once more, himself and his own writings.

But we who seek the heavenly bread must role the belly, which is beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it, which \"God shall destroy,\"[fn-37-P3714_1124874:2-nf] says the apostle, justly execrating gluttonous desires. For \"meats are for the belly,\"[fn-37-P3715_1124979:3-nf] for on them depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence[fn-37-P3716_1125064:4-nf] some, speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape,[fn-37-P3717_1125165:5-nf] to pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapae. He says accordingly somewhere, \"When thou art called to a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest place; \"[fn-37-P3718_1126057:6-nf] and elsewhere, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper; \"and again, \"But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,\"[fn-37-P3719_1126200:7-nf] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further, \"A certain man made a great supper, and called many.\"[fn-37-P3720_1126338:8-nf] But I perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: \"from the gullets and furious love for suppers\"-according to the comic poet. For, in truth, \"to many, many things are on account of the supper.\" For they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. \"It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.\"[fn-37-P3721_1127286:9-nf] \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-37-P3722_1127368:10-nf] But the hardest of all cases is for charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that is to be done away with? \"For if,\" it is said, \"I bestow all my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.\"[fn-37-P3723_1127680:11-nf] On this love alone depend the law and the Word; and if \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour,\" this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. \"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,\" says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as ephemeral, \"but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3724_1128287:12-nf] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is communication. \"And the care of discipline is love,\" as Wisdom says; \"and love is the keeping of the law.\"[fn-37-P3725_1128634:13-nf] And these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper. But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, \"Let the children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe on Thee.\"[fn-37-P3726_1129036:14-nf] \"For the righteous shall not live by bread.\"[fn-37-P3727_1129101:15-nf] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point which is beyond the sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for communication; having as its rich provision sufficiency, which, presiding over diet measured in due quantity, and treating the body in a healthful way, distributes something from its resources to those near us, But the diet which exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates his spirit, and renders his body prone to disease. Besides, those dainty tastes, which trouble themselves about rich dishes drive to practices of ill-repute, daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity, insatiability. Appropriate designations of such people as so indulge are flies, weasels, flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of parasites-the one class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and the other life, for the gratification of the belly; crawling on their bellies, beasts in human shape after the image of their father, the voracious beast. People first called the abandoneda0sw/touj, and so appear to me to indicate their end, understanding them as those who are (a0sw/souj) unsaved, excluding the j. For those that are absorbed in pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if they were not to live [hereafter]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah, denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love (agape), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word. \"But they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" And that He reckons such luxury to be sin, is shown by what He adds, \"And your sin shall not be forgiven you till you die,\"[fn-37-P3728_1130943:16-nf] -not conveying the idea that death, which deprives of sensation, is the forgiveness of sin, but meaning that death of salvation which is the recompense of sin. \"Take no pleasure in abominable delicacies, says Wisdom.[fn-37-P3729_1131184:17-nf] At this point, too, we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols, in order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them.

Excess, which in all things is an evil, is very highly reprehensible in the matter of food.

But better is the man who, although meeting with the work of Celsus, needs no answer to it at all, but who despises all its contents, since they are contemned, and with good reason, by every believer in Christ, through the Spirit that is in him.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":14,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_140_on_the_jewish_meats_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And thus there was a certain ancient time, wherein those shadows or figures were to be used, that meats should be abstained from which had indeed been commended by their creation, but had been prohibited by the law. But now Christ, the end of the law, has come, disclosing all the obscurities of the law-all those things which antiquity had covered with the clouds of sacraments. For the illustrious Master, and the heavenly Teacher, and the ordainer of the perfected truth, has come, under whom at length it is rightly said: \"To the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.\"[fn-105-P10519_3324091:21-nf] Moreover, in another place: \"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused which is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.\"[fn-105-P10520_3324289:22-nf] Again, in another place: \"The Spirit expressly says that in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by them which believe and those who know God.\"[fn-105-P10521_3324710:23-nf] Moreover, in another passage: \"Everything that is sold in the market-place eat, asking nothing.\"[fn-105-P10522_3324832:24-nf] From these things it is plain that all those things are returned to their original blessedness now that the law is finished, and that we must not revert to the special observances of meats, which observances were ordained for a certain reason, but which evangelical liberty has now taken away, their discharge being given. The apostle cries out: \"The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace. and joy.\"[fn-105-P10523_3325281:25-nf] Also elsewhere: \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.\"[fn-105-P10524_3325487:26-nf] God is not worshipped by the belly nor by meats, which the Lord says will perish, and are \"purged\" by natural law in the draught.[fn-105-P10525_3325638:27-nf] For he who worships the Lord by meats, is merely as one who has his belly for his Lord. The meat, I say, true, and holy, and pure, is a true faith, an unspotted conscience, and an innocent soul. Whosoever is thus fed, feeds also with Christ. Such a banqueter is God's guest: these are the feasts that feed the angels, these are the tables which the martyrs make. Hence is that word of the law: \"Man cloth not live by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"[fn-105-P10526_3326272:28-nf] Hence, too, that saying of Christ: \"My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.\"[fn-105-P10527_3326401:29-nf] Hence, \"Ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of my loaves and were filled. But labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which endureth to life eternal, which the Son of man will give you; for Him hath the Father sealed.\"[fn-105-P10528_3326689:30-nf] By righteousness, I say, and by continency, and by the rest of the virtues, God is worshipped. For Zecharias also tells us, saying: \"If ye eat or drink, is it not ye that eat or drink? \"[fn-105-P10529_3326898:31-nf] -declaring thereby that meat or drink attain not unto God, but unto man: for neither is God fleshly, so as to be pleased with flesh; nor is He careful[fn-105-P10530_3327074:32-nf] for these pleasures, so as to rejoice in our food.[fn-105-P10531_3327186:33-nf] God rejoices in our faith alone, in our innocency alone, in our truth alone, in our virtues alone. And these dwell not in our belly, but in our soul; and these are acquired for us by divine awe and heavenly fear, and not by earthly food.

To cling to God continually, and as you say inseparably to hold fast to meditation on Him, is impossible for a man while still in this weak flesh of ours. But we ought to be aware on what we should have the purpose of our mind fixed, and to what goal we should ever recall the gaze of our soul: and when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and grieve and sigh when it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it discovers itself to have fallen away from gazing on Him, it should admit that it has lapsed from the highest good, considering that even a momentary departure from gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our gaze has wandered ever so little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the soul back to Him, and recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight direction. For everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when the devil has been expelled. from this, and sins no longer reign in it, it follows that the kingdom of God as founded in us, as the Evangelist says \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-35-P3539_1321607:14-nf] But nothing else can be \"within you,\" but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the character, when he says \"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3540_1322000:15-nf] And so if the kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death.

To cling to God continually, and as you say inseparably to hold fast to meditation on Him, is impossible for a man while still in this weak flesh of ours. But we ought to be aware on what we should have the purpose of our mind fixed, and to what goal we should ever recall the gaze of our soul: and when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and grieve and sigh when it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it discovers itself to have fallen away from gazing on Him, it should admit that it has lapsed from the highest good, considering that even a momentary departure from gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our gaze has wandered ever so little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the soul back to Him, and recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight direction. For everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when the devil has been expelled. from this, and sins no longer reign in it, it follows that the kingdom of God as founded in us, as the Evangelist says \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-35-P3539_1321607:14-nf] But nothing else can be \"within you,\" but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the character, when he says \"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3540_1322000:15-nf] And so if the kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death. For by these tokens the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil are distinguished: and in truth if lifting up our mental gaze on high we would consider that state in which the heavenly powers live on high, who are truly in the kingdom of God, what should we imagine it to be except perpetual and lasting joy?

Sunt autem etiam, qui matrimonium aperte dicunt fornicationem, et decernunt id traditum esse a diabolo. Dicunt autem gloriosi isti jactatores se imitari Dominum, qui neque uxorem duxit, neque in mundo aliquid possedit; se magis quam alii Evangelium intellexisse gloriantes.

Propterea nec \"tempora\" prae finiit, \"quge Pater posuit in sua potestate,\"[fn-62-P6297_1925953:64-nf] ut permaneret mundus per generationes. Illud autem: \"Non omnes capiunt verbum hoc: sunt enim eunuchi, qui sic nati sunt; et sunt eunuchi, qui castrati sunt ab hominibus; et sunt eunuchi, qui seipsos castrarunt propier regnum coelorum. Qui potest capere, capiat; \"[fn-62-P6298_1926233:65-nf] nesciunt quod, postquam de divortio esset locutus, cum quidam rogassent: \"Si sic sit causa uxoris, non expedit homini uxorem ducere; \"tunc dixit Dominus: \"Non omnes capiunt vetbum hoc, sed quibus datum est.\"[fn-62-P6299_1926465:66-nf] Hoc enim qui rogabant, volebant ex eo scire, an uxore damnata et ejecta propter fornicationem, concedar aliam ducere. Aiunt autem athletas quoque non paucos abstinere a venere, propier exercitationem corporis continentes: quemadmodum Crotoniatem Astylum, et Crisonem Himeraeum. Quinetiam Amoebeus citharoedus, cum recenter matrimonio junctus esset, a sponsa abstinuit: et Cyrenaeus Aristoteles amantem Laidem solus despexit. Cum meretrici itaque jurasset, se eam esse in patriam abducturum, si sibi adversus decertantes advesarios in aliquibus opem tulisset, postquam id perfecisset, lepide a se dictum jusjurandum exsequens, cum curasset imaginem ejus quam simillimam depingi, eam Cyrenae statuit, ut scribit Ister in libro De proprietate certaminum. Quare nec castitas est bonum, nisi fiat propter delectionem Dei. Jam de iis, qui matrimonium abhorrent, dicit beatus Paulus: \"In novissimis diebus deficient quidam a fide, attendentes spiritibus erroris, et doctrinis daemoniorum, prohibentium nubere, abstinere a cibis.\"[fn-63-P6300_1927512:67-nf] Et rursus dicit: \"Nemo vos seducat in voluntaria humilitatis religione, et parcimonia corporis.\"[fn-63-P6301_1927631:68-nf] Idem autem ilia quoque scribit: \"Alligatus es uxori? ne quaeras solutionem.

Aliqui autem etiam liberos susceperunt, continenter versati in matrimonio. Et Eliae quidem corvi alimentum afferebant, panes et carnes. Quinetiam Samuel propheta armum, quem ex iis, quae comedisset, reliquerat, allatum, dedit edenalum Sauli. Hi autem, qui se cos dicunt vitae institutis excellere, cum illorum actionibus ne poterunt quidem conferri. \"Qui\" itaque \"non comedit, comedentem ne spernat.

Petrus enim et Philippu\"[fn-63-P6306_1928781:73-nf] filios procrearunt: Philippus autem filias quoque suas viris locavit. Et Paulus quidem certe non veretur in quadam epistola suam appellare \"conjugem,\" quam non circumferebat, quod non magno ei esset opus ministerio. Dicit itaque in quadam epistola: \"Non habemus potestatem sororem uxorem circumducendi, sicut et reliqui apostoli? \"[fn-63-P6307_1929137:74-nf] Sed hi quidem, ut erat consentaneum, ministerio, quod divelli non poterat, praedicationi scilicet, attendentes, non ut uxores , sed ut sorores circumducebant mulieres, quae una ministraturae essent apud mulieres quae domos custodiebant: per quas etiam in gynaeceum, absque ulla reprehensione malave suspicione, ingredi posset doctrina Domini. Scimus enim quae cunque de feminis diaconis in altera ad Timotheum praestantissimus[fn-63-P6308_1929584:75-nf] docet Paulus.

Or do you say, Theft is one thing, delivery of the sacred books or persecution is another? I grant there is a difference, nor is it worth while now to show wherein that difference consists. But listen to the summary of the argument. If he could not make you a thief, because his thieving was displeasing in your sight, who can make men traditors or murderers to whom such treachery or murder is abhorrent? First, then, confess that you share in all the evil of Optatus, whom you knew, and even so reproach me with any evil which was found in those whom I knew not. And do not say to me, But my charges are serious, yours but trifling. You must first acknowledge them, however trifling they may be in your case, not before I on my side confess the charges against me, but before I can allow you to say these serious things about me at all. Did Optatus, whom you knew make you a thief by being your colleague, or not? Answer me one or the other. If you say he did not, I ask why he did not,-because he was not a thief himself? or because you do not know it? or because you disapprove of it? If you say, Because he himself was not a thief, much more ought we not to believe that those with whom you reproach us were of such a character as you assert. For if we must not believe of Optatus what both Christians and pagans and Jews, ay, and what both our party and yours assert, how much less should we believe what you assert of any one? But if you say, Because you do not know it, all the nations of the earth answer you, Much more do we not know of all that you reproach us with in these men. But if you say, Because you disapproved of it, they answer you with the same voice, Although you have never proved the truth of what you say, yet acts like these are viewed by us with disapproval. But if you say, Lo, Optatus, whom I knew, made me a thief because he was my colleague, and I was in the habit of going to the altar with him when he committed those deeds; but I do not greatly heed it, because the fault was trivial, but your party made you a traditor and a murderer,-I answer that I do not allow that I too am made a traditor and a murderer by the sins of other men, just because you confess that you are made a thief by the sin of another man; for it must be remembered that you are proved a thief, not by our judgment, but by your own confession. For we say that every man must bear his own burden, as the apostle is our witness.[fn-49-P4903_2413274:84-nf] But you, of your own accord, have taken the burden of Optatus on your own shoulders, not because you committed the theft, or consented to it, but because you declared your conviction that what another did applied to you. For, as the apostle says, when speaking of food, \"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean;\"[fn-49-P4904_2413720:85-nf] by the same rule, it may be said that the sins of others cannot implicate those who disapprove of them; but if any one thinks that they affect him, then he is affected by them. Wherefore you do not convict us of being traditors or murderers, even though you were to prove something of the sort against those who share the sacraments with us; but the guilt of theft is fastened on you, even if you disapprove of everything that Optatus did, not in virtue of our accusation, but by your own decision. And that you may not think this a trivial fault, read what the apostle says, \"Nor shall thieves inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-49-P4905_2414363:86-nf] But those who shall not inherit the kingdom of God will certainly not be on His right hand among those whom it shall be said, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" If they are not there, where will they be except on the left hand? Therefore among those to whom it shall be said, \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.\"[fn-49-P4906_2414820:87-nf] In vain, therefore, do you indulge in your security, thinking it a trivial fault which separates you from the kingdom of God, and sends you into everlasting fire.

When did he to the Jews become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: \"Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing,\"[fn-59-P5932_2100068:21-nf] yet by circumcising Timothy he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And again, where did he become to those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where James and all the Elders of the Church, fearing lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or rather of Judaizing Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in such a way as still to be bound by the rites of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said: \"Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who have believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children;\" and below: \"Do therefore this that we say unto thee: we have four men who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify thyself with them and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard of thee are false, but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.\"[fn-59-P5933_2101198:22-nf] And so for the good of those who were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the strict view which he had expressed: \"For I through the law am dead unto the law that I may live unto God;\"[fn-59-P5934_2101416:23-nf] and was driven to shave his head, and be purified according to the law and pay his vows after the Mosaic rites in the Temple. Do you ask also where for the good of those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing: \"As I passed by,\" he says, \"I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown God;\" and when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the faith of Christ, saying: \"What therefore ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.\" And after a little, as if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ, saying: \"As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.\" And when he had thus approached them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by things false, he added and said: \"Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of man.\"[fn-59-P5935_2102689:24-nf] But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again,[fn-59-P5936_2102865:25-nf] or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling.[fn-59-P5937_2103021:26-nf] But he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he says: \"He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth:\"and: \"He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better;\" and elsewhere: \"Who,\" says he, \"is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?\" and in this way he fulfilled what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: \"Be ye without offence to Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit but that of the many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-59-P5938_2103712:27-nf] For it had certainly been profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going barefoot,[fn-59-P5939_2103935:28-nf] not to pay legal vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done with the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it right to believe that he who had said: \"For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,\"[fn-59-P5940_2104934:29-nf] would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to such an extent is account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the disposition of the doer, that on the other hand truth is sometimes found to have injured some, and a lie to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants about David's flight, and saying: \"Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make you all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me,\" did Doeg the Edomite say anything but the truth, when he told him: \"I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, who consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the Philistine?\"[fn-59-P5941_2105735:30-nf] For which true story he deserved to be rooted up out of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the prophet: \"Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck thee up and tear thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the living:\"[fn-59-P5942_2106018:31-nf] He then for showing the truth is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the harlot Rahab with her family is planted for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson most injuriously betrayed to his wicked wife the truth which he had hidden for a long time by a lie, and therefore the truth so inconside-rately disclosed was the cause of his own deception, because he had neglected to keep the command of the prophet: \"Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.\"[fn-59-P5943_2106543:32-nf] ","title":"XVII.

If He is man, how can another's body speak in his heart? If God, then Christ is not a man but God; for since Christ spoke in the Apostle, and only God could speak in him, therefore a Divine Christ spoke in him. And so you see that there is nothing to be said here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and God: because complete Divinity was in Christ, and Christ was completely in God. No division or severing of the two can here be admitted. There is only one simple, pious, and sound confession to be made; viz., to adore, love, and worship Christ as God. But do you want to understand more fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God and Christ, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with Christ? Hear what the Apostle says to the Corinthians: \"For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.\"[fn-70-P7015_2541517:14-nf] But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he says: \"We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\"[fn-70-P7016_2541766:15-nf] You see then that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand then without any doubt that Christ is God; and when you see that the substance of God and Christ is altogether inseparable, admit also that the Person cannot be severed. Unless forsooth because the Apostle in one Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and in another before that of God, you invent two judgment seats, and fancy that some will be judged by Christ and others by God. But this is foolish and wild, and madder than a madman's utterances. Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the God of the universe, acknowledge the judgment seat of God in the judgment seat of Christ. Love life, love your salvation, love Him by whom you were created. Fear Him by whom you are to be judged. For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and laying aside wicked blasphemy and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you think that the judgment seat of God is different from that of Christ, you will come before the judgment seat of Christ, and will find by evidence that there is no gainsaying, that the judgment seat of God is indeed the same as that of Christ, and that in Christ the Son of God, there is all the glory of God the Son, and the power of God the Father. \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father.\"[fn-70-P7017_2543264:16-nf] For whoever denies the Father denies the Son also. \"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.\"[fn-70-P7018_2543444:17-nf] And so you should learn that the glory of the Father and the Son is inseparable, and their majesty is inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without the Father, nor the Father without the Son. But no man can honour God and the Son of God except in Christ the only-begotten Son of God. For it is impossible for a man to have the Spirit of God who is to be honoured except in the Spirit of Christ, as the Apostle says: \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. But if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.\"[fn-70-P7019_2544055:18-nf] And again: \"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose again.\"[fn-70-P7020_2544255:19-nf] You see then now, even against your will, that there is absolutely no difference between the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, or between the judgment of God and the judgment of Christ. Choose then which you will -for one of the two must happen-either acknowledge in faith that Christ is God, or admit that God is in Christ at your condemnation.","title":"Book III.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":14,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_78_letter_vii_for_335_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"8.

As the blessed Paul saith in a certain place, when describing the incomprehensible riches of Christ: `But God, being rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in follies and sins, quickened us with Christ[fn-92-P9240_3354086:16-nf] .'

But as soon as ever a man begins to walk in the perfect way, he is no longer fed with the things before mentioned, but he has the Word for bread, and flesh for food, for it is written, `Strong meat is for those who are of full age, for those who, by reason of their capacity, have their senses exercised[fn-92-P9244_3355920:20-nf] .'

Not with virgins alone is such a field adorned; nor with monks alone but also with honourable matrimony and the chastity of each one. For in sowing, He did not compel the will beyond the power. Nor is mercy confined to the perfect, but it is sent down also among those who occupy the middle and the third ranks, so that He might rescue all men generally to salvation.

But because the right practice of abstinence is needful not only to the mortification of the flesh but also to the purification of the mind, we desire your observance to be so complete that, as you cut down the pleasures that be long to the lusts of the flesh, so you should banish the errors that proceed from the imaginations of the heart. For he whose heart is polluted with no misbelief prepares himself with true and reasonable purification for the Paschal Feast, in which all the mysteries of our religion meet together.

For the mind then only keeps holy and spiritual fast when it rejects the food of error and the poison of falsehood, which our crafty and wily foe plies us with more treacherously now, when by the very return of the venerable Festival, the whole church generally is admonished to understand the mysteries of its salvation. For he is the true confessor and worshipper of Christ's resurrection, who is not confused about His passion, nor deceived about His bodily nativity. For some are so ashamed of the Gospel of the Cross of Christ, as to impudently nullify the punishment which He underwent for the world's redemption, and have denied the very nature of true flesh in the Lord, not understanding how the impossible and unchangeable Deity of God's Word could have so far condescended for man's salvation, as by His power not to lose His own properties, and in His mercy to take on Him ours. And so in Christ, there is a twofold form but one person, and the Son of God, who is at the same time Son of Man, is one Lord, accepting the condition of a slave by the design of loving-kindness, not by the law of necessity, because by His power He became humble, by His power passible, by His power mortal; that for the destruction of the tyranny of sin and death, the weak nature in Him might be capable of punishment, and the strong nature not lose aught of its glory.","title":"Sermon XLVI.

The Lord, by His promise, gave those whose hopes were resting on Himself a special ground of confidence, when He said, \"For I go to the Father; and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it.\" His proceeding, therefore, to the Father, was not with any view of abandoning the needy, but of hearing and answering their petitions. But what is to be made of the words, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask,\" when we behold His faithful ones so often asking and not receiving? Is it, shall we say, for no other reason but that they ask amiss? For the Apostle James made this a ground of reproach when he said, \"Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.\"[fn-27-P2731_1595484:1-nf] What one, therefore, wishes to receive, in order to turn to an improper use, God in His mercy rather refuses to bestow. Nay, more, if a man asks what would, if answered, only tend to his injury, there is surely greater cause to fear, lest what God could not withhold with kindness, He should give in His anger. Do we not see how the Israelites got to their own hurt what their guilty lusting craved? For while it was raining manna on them from heaven, they desired to have flesh to eat.[fn-27-P2732_1595986:2-nf] They disdained what they had, and shamelessly sought what they had not: as if it were not better for them to have asked not to have their unbecoming desires gratified with the food that was wanting, but to have their own dislike removed, and be made themselves to receive aright the food that was provided. For when evil becomes our delight, and what is good the reverse, we ought to be entreating God rather to win us back to the love of the good, than to grant us the evil. Not that it is wrong to eat flesh, for the apostle, speakingof this very thing, says, \"Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused which is received with thanksgiving;[fn-27-P2733_1596660:3-nf] but because, as he also says, \"It is evil for thatman who eateth with offense;\"[fn-27-P2734_1596757:4-nf] and if so,with offense to man, how much more so if to God, to whom it was no light offense, on the part of the Israelites, to reject what wisdom was supplying, and ask for that which lust was craving: although they would not actually make the request, but murmured because itwas wanting. But to let us know that the wrong lies not with any creature of God, but with obstinate disobedience and inordinate desire, it was not in swine's flesh that the first man found death, but in an apple;[fn-27-P2735_1597263:5-nf] and it was not for a fowl, but for a dish of pottage, that Esau lost his birthright.[fn-27-P2736_1597364:6-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_91_tractate_lxxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. \"Ye have not chosen me,\" He says, \"but I have chosen you.\" Grace such as that is ineffable. For what were we so long as Christ had not yet chosen us, and we were therefore still destitute of love? For he who hath chosen Him, how can he love Him? Were we, think you, in that condition which is sung of in the psalm: \"I had rather be an abject in the house of the Lord, than dwell in the tents of wickedness\"?[fn-29-P2985_1697298:11-nf] Certainly not. What were we then, but sinful and lost? We had not yet come to believe on Him, in order to lead to His choosing us; for if it were those who already believed that He chose, then was He chosen Himself, prior to His choosing. But how could He say, \"Ye have not chosen me,\" save only because His mercy anticipated us?[fn-29-P2986_1697649:12-nf] Here surely is at fault the vain reasoning of those who defend the foreknowledge of God in opposition to His grace, and with this view declare that we were chosen before the foundation of the world,[fn-29-P2987_1697866:13-nf] because God foreknew that we should be good, but not that He Himself would make us good. So says not He, who declares, \"Ye have not chosen me.\" For had Hechosen us on the ground that He foreknew that we should be good, then would He also have foreknown that we would not be the first to make choice of Him. For in no other way could we possibly be good: unless, forsooth, one could be called good who has never made good his choice. What was it then that He chose in those who were not good? For they were not chosen because of their goodness, inasmuch as they could not be good without being chosen. Otherwise grace is no more grace, if we maintain the priority of merit. Such, certainly, is the election of grace, whereof the apostle says: \"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.\" To which he adds: \"And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-29-P2988_1698826:14-nf] Listen, thou ungrateful one, listen: \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.\" Not that thou mayest say, I am chosen because I already believed. For if thou wert believing in Him, then hadst thou already chosen Him. But listen: \"Ye have not chosen me.\" Not that thou mayest say, Before I believed I was already doing good works, and therefore was I chosen. For what good work can be prior to faith, when the apostle says, \"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin\"?[fn-29-P2989_1699311:15-nf] What, then, are we to say on hearing such words, \"Ye have not chosen me,\" but that we were evil, and were chosen in order that we might be good through the grace of Him who chose us? For it is not by grace, if merit preceded: but it is of grace: and therefore that grace did not find, but effected the merit.","title":"Tractate LXXXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_215_letter_cxcvii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"I wish to acquaint your love in Christ that the very zealous brethren who have been commissioned by your reverence to act for you in this good work have won praise for all the clergy by the amiability of their manners; for by their individual modesty and conciliatoriness they have shewn the sound condition of all. Moreover, with all zeal and diligence they have braved an inclement season; and with unbroken perseverance have persuaded the faithful guardians of the blessed body to transmit to them the custody of what they have regarded as the safeguard of their lives. And you must understand that they are men who would never have been forced by any human authority or sovereignty, had not the perseverance of these brethren moved them to compliance. No doubt a great aid to the attainment of the object desired was the presence of our well beloved and reverend son Therasius the presbyter. He voluntarily undertook all the toil of the journey; he moderated the energy of the faithful on the spot; he persuaded opponents by his arguments; in the presence of priests and deacons, and of many others who fear the Lord, he took up the relics with all becoming reverence, and has aided the brethren in their preservation. These relics do you receive with a joy equivalent to the distress with which their custodians have parted with them and sent them to you. Let none dispute; let none doubt. Here you have that unconquered athlete. These bones, which shared in the conflict with the blessed soul, are known to the Lord.

None other lay by his side. The burial was a noble one; the honours of a martyr were paid him. Christians who had welcomed him as a guest and then with their own hands laid him in the grave, have now disinterred him. They have wept as men bereaved of a father and a champion. But they have sent him to you, for they put your joy before their own consolation. Pious were the hands that gave; scrupulously careful were the hands that received.

I shall thus leave behind me detailed evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their turn will be able to inform others. The Christian ought to be so minded as becomes his heavenly calling,[fn-28-P2894_958820:2-nf] and his life and conversation ought to be worthy of the Gospel of Christ.[fn-28-P2895_958911:3-nf] The Christian ought not to be of doubtful mind,[fn-28-P2896_958979:4-nf] nor by anything drawn away from the recollection of God and of His purposes and judgments. The Christian ought in all things to become superior to the righteousness existing under the law, and neither swear nor lie.[fn-28-P2897_959216:5-nf] He ought not to speak evil;[fn-28-P2898_959264:6-nf] to do violence;[fn-28-P2899_959296:7-nf] to fight;[fn-29-P2900_959324:8-nf] to avenge himself;[fn-29-P2901_959360:9-nf] to return evil for evil;[fn-29-P2902_959403:10-nf] to be angry.[fn-29-P2903_959435:11-nf] The Christian ought to be patient,[fn-29-P2904_959488:12-nf] whatever he have to suffer, and to convict the wrong-doer in season,[fn-29-P2905_959574:13-nf] not with the desire of his own vindication, but of his brother's reformation,[fn-29-P2906_959670:14-nf] according to the commandment of the Lord. The Christian ought not to say anything behind his brother's back with the object of calumniating him, for this is slander, even if what is said is true.[fn-29-P2907_959885:15-nf] He ought to turn away from the brother who speaks evil against him;[fn-29-P2908_959997:16-nf] he ought not to indulge in jesting.[fn-29-P2909_960081:17-nf] he ought not to laugh nor even to suffer laugh makers.[fn-29-P2910_960151:18-nf] He must not talk idly, saying things which are of no service to the hearers nor to such usage as is necessary and permitted us by God;[fn-29-P2911_960597:19-nf] so that workers may do their best as far as possible to work in silence; and that good words be suggested to them by those who are entrusted with the duty of carefully dispensing the word to the building up of the faith, lest God's Holy Spirit be grieved.
