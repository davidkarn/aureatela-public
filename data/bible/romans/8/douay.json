{"verses":["There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ\nJesus, who walk not according to the flesh.","For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered\nme from the law of sin and of death.","For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the\nflesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of\nsin, hath condemned sin in the flesh.","That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us who\nwalk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.","For they that are according to the flesh mind the things that are\nof the flesh:  but they that are according to the spirit mind the things\nthat are of the spirit.","For the wisdom of the flesh is death:  but the wisdom of the spirit\nis life and peace.","Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God.  For it is not\nsubject to the law of God:  neither can it be.","And they who are in the flesh cannot please God.","But you are not in the flesh, but the spirit, if so be that the\nSpirit of God dwell in you.  Now if any man have not the Spirit of\nChrist, he is none of his.","And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin:\nbut the spirit liveth, because of justification.","And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell\nin you; he that raised up Jesus Christ, from the dead shall quicken\nalso your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.","Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live\naccording to the flesh.","For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die:  but if by\nthe Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.","For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of\nGod.","For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear:\nbut you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry:\nAbba (Father).","For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit that we are\nthe sons of God.","And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with\nChrist:  yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified\nwith him.","For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to\nbe compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us.","For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of\nthe sons of God.","For the creature was made subject to vanity:  not willingly, but\nby reason of him that made it subject, in hope.","Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the\nservitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children\nof God.","For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain,\neven till now.","And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of\nthe Spirit:  even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the\nadoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.","For we are saved by hope.  But hope that is seen is not hope.  For\nwhat a man seeth, why doth he hope for?","But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with\npatience.","Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity.  For, we know not\nwhat we should pray for as we ought:  but the Spirit himself asketh for\nus with unspeakable groanings,","And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the Spirit\ndesireth:  because he asketh for the saints according to God.","And we know that to them that love God all things work together\nunto good:  to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be\nsaints.","For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made\nconformable to the image of his Son:  that he might be the Firstborn\namongst many brethren.","And whom he predestinated, them he also called.  And whom he\ncalled, them he also justified.  And whom he justified, them he also\nglorified.","What shall we then say to these things?  If God be for us, who is\nagainst us?","He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us\nall, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?","Who shall accuse against the elect of God?  God is he that\njustifieth:","Who is he that shall condemn?  Christ Jesus that died:  yea that is\nrisen also again, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh\nintercession for us.","Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Shall\ntribulation?  Or distress?  Or famine?  Or nakedness?  Or danger?  Or\npersecution?  Or the sword?","(As it is written:  For thy sake, we are put to death all the day\nlong.  We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)","But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath\nloved us.","For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor\nprincipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor\nmight,","Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to\nseparate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."]}
