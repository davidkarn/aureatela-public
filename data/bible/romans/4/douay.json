{"verses":["What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father\naccording to the flesh?","For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory,\nbut not before God.","For what saith the scripture?  Abraham believed God:  and it was\nreputed to him unto justice.","Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to\ngrace but according to debt.","But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth\nthe ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose\nof the grace of God.","As David also termeth the blessedness of a man to whom God\nreputeth justice without works:","Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven:  and whose sins are\ncovered.","Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.","This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only or\nin the uncircumcision also?  For we say that unto Abraham faith was\nreputed to justice.","How then was it reputed?  When he was in circumcision or in\nuncircumcision?  Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.","And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice\nof the faith which he had, being uncircumcised:  that he might be the\nfather of all them that believe, being uncircumcised:  that unto them\nalso it may be reputed to justice:","And he might be the father of circumcision; not to them only that\nare of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the\nfaith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.","For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his\nseed, that he should be heir of the world:  but through the justice of\nfaith.","For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void:  the\npromise is made of no effect.","For the law worketh wrath.  For where there is no law, neither is\nthere transgression.","Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise\nmight be firm to all the seed:  not to that only which is of the law,\nbut to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of\nus all,","(As it is written:  I have made thee a father of many nations),\nbefore God, whom he believed:  who quickeneth the dead and calleth those\nthings that are not, as those that are.","Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the\nfather of many nations, according to that which was said to him:  So\nshall thy seed be.","And he was not weak in faith.  Neither did he consider his own\nbody, now dead (whereas he was almost an hundred years old), nor the\ndead womb of Sara.","In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust:  but was\nstrengthened in faith, giving glory to God:","Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able\nalso to perform.","And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.","Now it is not written only for him.  that it was reputed to him\nunto justice,","But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in\nhim that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,","Who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our\njustification."]}
