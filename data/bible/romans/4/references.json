We ought indeed to walk so holily, and with so entire substantiality[fn-3-P366_77486:9-nf] of faith, as to be confident and secure in regard of our own conscience, desiring that that (gift) may abide in us to the end, yet not presuming (that it will). For he who presumes feels less apprehension; he who feels less apprehension takes less precaution; he who takes less precaution runs more risk. Fear[fn-3-P367_77874:10-nf] is the foundation of salvation; presumption is an impediment to fear. More useful, then, is it to apprehend that we may possibly fail, than to presume that we cannot; for apprehending will lead us to fear, fearing to caution, and caution to salvation. On the other hand, if we presume, there will be neither fear nor caution to save us. He who acts securely, and not at the same time warily, possesses no safe and firm security; whereas he who is wary will be truly able to be secure. For His own servants, may the Lord by His mercy take care that to them it may be lawful even to presume on His goodness!

But for our present need we must discuss, so far as God gives us power, in what manner the single of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ answers to, and is, so to say, in harmony with our double to the effect of salvation. We certainly, as no Christian doubts, are dead both in soul and body: in soul, because of sin; in body, because of the punishment of sin, and through this also in body because of sin. And to both these parts of ourselves, that is, both to soul and to body, there was need both of a medicine and of resurrection, that what had been changed for the worse might be renewed for the better. Now the death of the soul is ungodliness, and the death of the body is corruptibility, through which comes also a departure of the soul from the body. For as the soul dies when God leaves it, so the body dies when the soul leaves it; whereby the former becomes foolish, the latter lifeless. For the soul is raised up again by repentance, and the renewing of life is begun in the body still mortal by faith, by which men believe on Him who justities the ungodly;[fn-8-P828_322114:13-nf] and it is increased and strengthened by good habits from day to day, as the inner man is renewed more and more.[fn-8-P829_322243:14-nf] But the body, being as it were the outward man, the longer this life lasts is so much the more corrupted, either by age or by disease, or by various afflictions, until it come to that last affliction which all call death. And its resurrection is delayed until the end; when also our justification itself shall be perfected ineffably. For then we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.[fn-8-P830_322659:15-nf] But now, so long as the corruptible body presseth down the soul,[fn-8-P831_322744:16-nf] and human life upon earth is all temptation,[fn-8-P832_322807:17-nf] in His sight shall no man living be justified,[fn-8-P833_322872:18-nf] in comparison of the righteousness in which we shall be made equal with the angels, and of the glory which shall be revealed in us. But why mention more proofs respecting the difference between the death of the soul and the death of the body, when the Lord in one sentence of the Gospel has made either death easily distinguishable by any one from the other, where He says, \"Let the dead bury their dead\"?[fn-8-P834_323298:19-nf] For burial was the fitting disposal of a dead body. But by those who were to bury it He meant those who were dead in soul by the impiety of unbelief, such, namely, as are awakened when it is said, \"Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.\"[fn-8-P835_323603:20-nf] And there is a death which the apostle denounces, saying of the widow, \"But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-8-P836_323751:21-nf] Therefore the soul, which was before ungodly and is now godly, is said to have come alive again from the dead and to live, on account of the righteousness of faith. But the body is not only said to be about to die, on account of that departure of the soul which will be; but on account of the great infirmity of flesh and blood it is even said to be now dead, in a certain place in the Scriptures, namely, where the apostle says, that \"the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.\"[fn-8-P837_324288:22-nf] Now this life is wrought by faith, \"since the just shall live by faith,\"[fn-8-P838_324380:23-nf] But what follows? \"But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit which dwelleth in you.\"[fn-8-P839_324605:24-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"108","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"Therefore as by the offence of one upon all men to condemnation, even so by the justification of One upon all men unto justification of life.\"[fn-3-P382_347563:54-nf] This \"offence of one,\" if we are bent on \"imitation,\" can only be the devil's offence.

The apostle, indeed, purposely selected this general precept, in which he embraced everything, as if this were the voice of the law, prohibiting us from all sin, when he says, \"Thou shalt not covet;\" for there is no sin committed except by evil concupiscence; so that the law which prohibits this is a good and praiseworthy law. But, when the Holy Ghost withholds His help, which inspires us with a good desire instead of this evil desire (in other words, diffuses love in our hearts), that law, however good in itself, only augments the evil desire by forbidding it. Just as the rush of water which flows incessantly in a particular direction, becomes more violent when it meets with any impediment, and when it has overcome the stoppage, falls in a greater bulk, and with increased impetuosity hurries forward in its downward course.

Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?

But they, in fact, were making their boast of God, as if they alone had deserved to receive His law, as the Psalmist said: \"He did not the like to any nation, nor His judgments has He displayed to them.\"[fn-13-P1337_668633:39-nf] And yet, they thought they were fulfilling the law of God by their righteousness, when they were rather breakers of it all the while!

For whoever did even what the law commanded, without the assistance of the Spirit of grace, acted through fear of punishment, not from love of righteousness, and hence in the sight of God that was not in the will, which in the sight of men appeared in the work; and such doers of the law were held rather guilty of that which God knew they would have preferred to commit, if only it had been possible with impunity. He calls, however, \"the circumcision of the heart\" the will that is pure from all unlawful desire; which comes not from the letter, inculcating and threatening, but from the Spirit, assisting and healing. Such doers of the law have their praise therefore, not of men but of God, who by His grace provides the grounds on which they receive praise, of whom it is said, \"My soul shall make her boast of the Lord;\"[fn-13-P1339_669740:41-nf] and to whom it is said, \"My praise shall be of Thee:\"[fn-13-P1340_669813:42-nf] but those are not such who would have God praised because they are men; but themselves, because they are righteous.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"In the passage where he speaks to the Corinthians about the letter that kills, and the spirit that gives life, he expresses himself more clearly, but he does not mean even there any other \"letter\" to be understood than the Decalogue itself, which was written on the two tables.

And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; who hath made us fit, as ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?

Well, then, is it owing to the one precept about the Sabbath-day, which is included in it, that the Decalogue is called \"the letter that killeth?\" Because, forsooth, every man that still observes that day in its literal appointment is carnally wise, but to be carnally wise is nothing else than death? And must the other nine commandments, which are rightly observed in their literal form, not be regarded as belonging to the law of works by which none is justified, but to the law of faith whereby the just man lives? Who can possibly entertain so absurd an opinion as to suppose that \"the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,\" is not said equally of all the ten commandments, but only of the solitary one touching the Sabbath-day? In which class do we place that which is thus spoken of: \"The law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression?\"[fn-14-P1433_699849:102-nf] and again thus: \"Until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law?\"[fn-14-P1434_699969:103-nf] and also that which we have already so often quoted: \"By the law is the knowledge of sin?\"[fn-14-P1435_700079:104-nf] and especially the passage in which the apostle has more clearly expressed the question of which we are treating: \"I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet?\"[fn-14-P1436_700285:105-nf] ","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"151","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"What then is the import of the \"All, from the least unto the greatest of them,\" but all that belong spiritually to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah,-that is, to the children of Isaac, to the seed of Abraham?

These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which is said of them, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled?\"[fn-17-P1738_775648:311-nf] Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him.

It was therefore necessary to mention God's loving-kindness and tender mercy there, where one might expect debts to be demanded and deserts recompensed so strictly as to leave no room for mercy. He crowns, therefore, with loving-kindness and tender mercy; but even so according to works. For he shall be separated to the right hand, to whom, it is said, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat.\"[fn-17-P1783_787204:347-nf] There will, however, be also \"judgment without mercy;\" but it will be for him\" that hath not showed mercy.\"[fn-17-P1784_787334:348-nf] But \"blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\"[fn-17-P1785_787414:349-nf] of God. Then, as soon as those on the left hand shall have gone into eternal fire, the righteous, too, shall go into everlasting life,[fn-17-P1786_787568:350-nf] because He says: \"This is life eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-17-P1787_787712:351-nf] And with this knowledge, this vision, this contemplation, shall the desire of their soul be satisfied; for it shall be enough for it to have this and nothing else,-there being nothing more for it to desire, to aspire to, or to require. It was with a craving after this full joy that his heart glowed who said to the Lord Christ, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;\" and to whom the answer was returned,\" He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-17-P1788_788187:352-nf] Because He is Himself the eternal life, in order that men may know the one true God, Thee and whom Thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.

Yes, but he pleased God before his circumcision;[fn-20-P2071_705176:37-nf] nor yet did he observe the Sabbath. For he had \"accepted\"[fn-20-P2072_705290:38-nf] circumcision; but such as was to be for \"a sign\" of that time, not for a prerogative title to salvation. In fact, subsequent patriarchs were uncircumcised, like Melchizedek, who, uncircumcised, offered to Abraham himself, already circumcised, on his return from battle, bread and wine.[fn-20-P2073_705681:39-nf] \"But again,\" (you say) \"the son of Moses would upon one occasion have been choked by an angel, if Zipporah,[fn-20-P2074_706106:40-nf] had not circumcised the foreskin of the infant with a pebble; whence, \"there is the greatest peril if any fail to circumcise the foreskin of his flesh.\" Nay, but if circumcision altogether brought salvation, even Moses himself, in the case of his own son, would not have omitted to circumcise him on the eighth day; whereas it is agreed that Zipporah did it on the journey, at the compulsion of the angel. Consider we, accordingly, that one single infant's compulsory circumcision cannot have prescribed to every people, and rounded, as it were, a law for keeping this precept. For God, foreseeing that He was about to give this circumcision to the people of Israel for \"a sign,\" not for salvation, urges the circumcision of the son of Moses, their future leader, for this reason; that, since He had begun, through him, to give the People the precept of circumcision, the people should not despise it, from seeing this example (of neglect) already exhibited conspicuously in their leader's son. For circumcision had to be given; but as \"a sign,\" whence Israel in the last time would have to be distinguished, when, in accordance with their deserts, they should be prohibited from entering the holy city, as we see through the words of the prophets, saying, \"Your land is desert; your cities utterly burnt with fire; your country, in your sight, strangers shall eat up; and, deserted and subverted by strange peoples, the daughter of Zion shall be derelict, like a shed in a vineyard, and like a watchhouse in a cucumber-field, and as it were a city which is being stormed.\"[fn-20-P2075_707833:41-nf] Why so? Because the subsequent discourse of the prophet reproaches them, saying, \"Sons have I begotten and upraised, but they have reprobated me; \"[fn-20-P2076_708021:42-nf] and again, \"And if ye shall have outstretched hands, I will avert my face from you; and if ye shall have multiplied prayers, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of blood; \"[fn-20-P2077_708290:43-nf] and again, \"Woe! sinful nation; a people full of sins; wicked sons; ye have quite forsaken God, and have provoked unto indignation the Holy One of Israel.\"[fn-20-P2078_708463:44-nf] This, therefore, was God's foresight,-that of giving circumcision to Israel, for a sign whence they might be distinguished when the time should arrive wherein their above-mentioned deserts should prohibit their admission into Jerusalem: which circumstance, because it was to be, used to be announced; and, because we see it accomplished, is recognised by us. For, as the carnal circumcision, which was temporary, was in wrought for \"a sign\" in a contumacious people, so the spiritual has been given for salvation to an obedient people; while the prophet Jeremiah says, \"Make a renewal for you, and sow not in thorns; be circumcised to God, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart: \"[fn-20-P2079_709164:45-nf] and in another place he says, \"Behold, days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will draw up, for the house of Judah and for the house of Jacob,[fn-20-P2080_709404:46-nf] a new testament; not such as I once gave their fathers in the day wherein I led them out from the land of Egypt.\"[fn-20-P2081_709572:47-nf] Whence we understand that the coming cessation of the former circumcision l then given, and the coming procession of a new law (not such as He had already given to the fathers), are announced: just as Isaiah foretold, saying that in the last days the mount of the Lord and the house of God were to be manifest above the tops of the mounts: \"And it shall be exalted,\" he says, \"above the hills; and there shall come over it all nations; and many shall walk, and say, Come, ascend we unto the mount of the Lord, and unto the house of the God of Jacob,\"[fn-20-P2082_710202:48-nf] -not of Esau, the former son, but of Jacob, the second; that is, of our \"people,\" whose \"mount\" is Christ, \"prµcised without concisors' hands,[fn-20-P2083_710365:49-nf] filling every land,\" shown in the book of Daniel.[fn-20-P2084_710460:50-nf] In short, the coming procession of a new law out of this \"house of the God of Jacob\" Isaiah in the ensuing words announces, saying, \"For from Zion shall go out a law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem, and shall judge among the nations,\"-that is, among us, who have been called out of the nations,-\"and they shall join to beat their glaives into ploughs, and their lances into sickles; and nations shall not take up glaive against nation, and they shall no more learn to fight.\"[fn-20-P2085_710997:51-nf] Who else, therefore, are understood but we, who, fully taught by the new law, observe these practices,-the old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the action itself[fn-20-P2086_711198:52-nf] demonstrates? For the wont of the old law was to avenge itself by the vengeance of the glaive, and to pluck out \"eye for eye,\" and to inflict retaliatory revenge for injury.[fn-20-P2087_711420:53-nf] But the new law's wont was to point to clemency, and to convert to tranquillity the pristine ferocity of \"glaives\" and \"lances,\" and to remodel the pristine execution of \"war\" upon the rivals and foes of the law into the pacific actions of \"ploughing\" and \"tilling\" the land.[fn-20-P2088_711772:54-nf] Therefore as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal circumcision was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual circumcision has shone out into the voluntary obediences[fn-20-P2089_712090:55-nf] of peace. For \"a people,\" he says, \"whom I knew not hath served me; in obedience of the ear it hath obeyed me.\"[fn-20-P2090_712243:56-nf] Prophets made the announcement. But what is the \"people\" which was ignorant of God, but ours, who in days bygone knew not God? and who, in the hearing of the ear, gave heed to Him, but we, who, forsaking idols, have been converted to God? For Israel-who had been known to God, and who had by Him been \"upraised\"[fn-20-P2091_712742:57-nf] in Egypt, and was transported through the Red Sea, and who in the desert, fed forty years with manna, was wrought to the semblance of eternity, and not contaminated with human passions,[fn-20-P2092_712978:58-nf] or fed on this world's[fn-20-P2093_713015:59-nf] meats, but fed on \"angel's loaves\"[fn-20-P2094_713186:60-nf] -the manna-and sufficiently bound to God by His benefits-forgot his Lord and God, saying to Aaron: \"Make us gods, to go before us: for that Moses, who ejected us from the land of Egypt, hath quite forsaken us; and what hath befallen him we know not.\" And accordingly we, who \"were not the people of God\" in days bygone, have been made His people,[fn-20-P2095_713595:61-nf] by accepting the new law above mentioned, and the new circumcision before foretold.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The book which you sent to me, my beloved sons, Timasius and Jacobus, I have read through hastily, but not indifferently, omitting only the few points which are plain enough to everybody; and I saw in it a man inflamed with most ardent zeal against those, who, when in their sins they ought to censure human will, are more forward in accusing the nature of men, and thereby endeavour to excuse themselves. He shows too great a fire against this evil, which even authors of secular literature have severely censured with the exclamation: \"The human race falsely complains of its own nature!\"[fn-18-P1894_816847:1-nf] This same sentiment your author also has strongly insisted upon, with all the powers of his talent.

It is occasioned by what Pelagius says in these words: \"That God gives to the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces, even as He conferred them on the Apostle Paul.\" Now, I should not have felt any anxiety about this answer of Pelagius, if it were not closely connected with the cause which we are bound to guardwith the utmost care-even that God's grace may never be attacked, while we are silent or dissembling in respect of so great an evil. As, therefore, he does not say, that God gives to whom He will, but that \"God gives to the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all these graces,\" I could not help being suspicious, when I read such words. For the very name of grace, and the thing that is meant by it, is taken away, if it is not bestowed gratuitously, but he only receives it who is worthy of it. Will anybody say that I do the apostle wrong, because I do not admit him to have been worthy of grace? Nay, I should indeed rather do him wrong, and bring on myself a punishment, if I refused to believe what he himself says. Well, now, has he not pointedly so defined grace as to show that it is so called because it is bestowed gratuitously? These are his own very words: \"And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-30-P3000_1164996:97-nf] In accordance with this, he says again: \"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.\"[fn-30-P3001_1165129:98-nf] Whosoever, therefore, is worthy, to him it is due; and if it is thus due to him, it ceases to be grace; for grace is given, but a debt is paid. Grace, therefore, is given to those who are unworthy, that a debt may be paid to them when they become worthy. He, however, who has bestowed on the unworthy the gifts which they possessed not before, does Himself take care that they shall have whatever things He means to recompense to them when they become worthy.","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_22_book_xvi","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"The word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision also. For when God promised him protection and exceeding great reward, he, being solicitous about posterity, said that a certain Eliezer of Damascus, born in his house, would be his heir. Immediately he was promised an heir, not that house-born servant, but one who was to come forth of Abraham himself; and again a seed innumerable, not as the dust of the earth, but as the stars of heaven,-which rather seems to me a promise of a posterity exalted in celestial felicity. For, so far as multitude is concerned, what are the stars of heaven to the dust of the earth, unless one should say the comparison is like inasmuch as the stars also cannot be numbered? For it is not to be believed that all of them can be seen. For the more keenly one observes them, the more does he see.

But even the infants, not personally in their own life, but according to the common origin of the human race, have all broken God's covenant in that one in whom all have sinned.[fn-28-P2895_1617653:66-nf] Now there are many things called God's covenants besides those two great ones, the old and the new, which any one who pleases may read and know. For the first covenant, which was made with the first man, is just this: \"In the day ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die.\"[fn-28-P2896_1617942:67-nf] Whence it is written in the book called Ecclesiasticus, \"All flesh waxeth old as doth a garment. For the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shall die the death.\"[fn-28-P2897_1618123:68-nf] Now, as the law was more plainly given afterward, and the apostle says, \"Where no law is, there is no prevarication,\"[fn-28-P2898_1618262:69-nf] on what supposition is what is said in the psalm true, \"I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,\"[fn-28-P2899_1618393:70-nf] except that all who are held liable for any sin are accused of dealing deceitfully (prevaricating) with some law? If on this account, then, even the infants are, according to the true belief, born in sin, not actual but original, so that we confess they have need of grace for the remission of sins, certainly it must be acknowledged that in the same sense in which they are sinners they are also prevaricators of that law which was given in Paradise, according to the truth of both scriptures, \"I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,\" and \"Where no law is, there is no prevarication.\" And thus, because circumcision was the sign of regeneration, and the infant, on account of the original sin by which God's covenant was first broken, was not undeservedly to lose his generation unless delivered by regeneration, these divine words are to be understood as if it had been said, Whoever is not born again, that soul shall perish from his people, because he hath broken my covenant, since he also has sinned in Adam with all others. For had He said, Because he hath broken this my covenant, He would have compelled us to understand by it only this of circumcision; but since He has not expressly said what covenant the infant has broken, we are free to understand Him as speaking of that covenant of which the breach can be ascribed to an infant. Yet if any one contends that it is said of nothing else than circumcision, that in it the infant has broken the covenant of God because, he is not circumcised, he must seek some method of explanation by which it may be understood without absurdity (such as this) that he has broken the covenant, because it has been broken in him although not by him. Yet in this case also it is to be observed that the soul of the infant, being guilty of no sin of neglect against itself, would perish unjustly, unless original sin rendered it obnoxious to punishment.","title":"Book XVI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_22_book_i_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Hence, then, it is clear that he acknowledges that grace whereby God points out and reveals to us what we are bound to do; but not that whereby He endows and assists us to act, since the knowledge of the law, unless it be accompanied by the assistance of grace, rather avails for producing the transgression of the commandment. \"Where there is no law,\" says the apostle, \"there is no transgression;\"[fn-32-P3236_1260485:9-nf] and again: \"I had not known lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-32-P3237_1260583:10-nf] Therefore so far are the law and grace from being the same thing, that the law is not only unprofitable, but it is absolutely prejudicial, unless grace assists it; and the utility of the law may be shown by this, that it obliges all whom it proves guilty of transgression to betake themselves to grace for deliverance and help to overcome their evil lusts. For it rather commands than assists; it discovers disease, but does not heal it; nay, the malady that is not healed is rather aggravated by it, so that the cure of grace is more earnestly and anxiously sought for, inasmuch as \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\"[fn-32-P3238_1261235:11-nf] \"For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.\"[fn-32-P3239_1261370:12-nf] To what extent, however, the law gives assistance, the apostle informs us when he says immediately afterwards: \"The Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-32-P3240_1261625:13-nf] Wherefore, says the apostle, \"the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-32-P3241_1261721:14-nf] Now this very thing is serviceable to proud men, to be more firmly and manifestly \"concluded under sin,\" so that none may pre-sumptuously endeavour to accomplish their justification by means of free will as if by their own resources; but rather \"that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

The true bride of Christ, whom thou hast the audacity to taunt with the stone tablets, knows the difference between the letter and the spirit, or in other words, between law and grace; and serving God no longer in the oldness of the letter, but in newness of spirit, she is not under the law, but under grace. She is not blinded by a spirit of controversy, but learns meekly from the apostle what is this law which we are not to be under; for \"it was given, \"he says, \"on account of transgression, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.\"[fn-16-P1636_906298:18-nf] And again: \"It entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has much more abounded.\"[fn-16-P1637_906427:19-nf] Not that the law is sin, though it cannot give life without grace, but rather increases the guilt; for \"where there is no law, there is no transgression.\"[fn-16-P1638_906599:20-nf] The letter without the spirit, the law without grace, can only condemn. So the apostle explains his meaning, in case any should not understand: \"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. For I had not known sin but by the law. For I had not known lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the command-merit, deceived me, and by it slew me. Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-16-P1639_907217:21-nf] She at whom thou scoffest knows what this means; for she asks earnestly, and seeks humbly, and knocks meekly. She sees that no fault is found with the law, when it is said, \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,\" any more than with knowledge, when it is said, \"Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.\"[fn-16-P1640_907551:22-nf] The passage runs thus: \"We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.\" The apostle certainly had no desire to be puffed up; but he had knowledge, because knowledge joined with love not only does not puff up, but strengthens. So the letter when joined with the spirit, and the law when joined with grace, is no longer the letter and the law in the same sense as when by itself it kills by abounding sin. In this sense the law is even called the strength of sin, because its strict prohibitions increase the fatal pleasure of sin. Even thus, however, the law is not evil; but \"sin. that it may appear sin, works death by that which is good.\" So things that are not evil may often be hurtful to certain people. The Manichaeans, when they have sore eyes, will shut out their god the sun. The bride of Christ, then, is dead to the law, that is, to sin, which abounds more from the prohibition of the law; for the law apart from grace commands, but does not enable. Being dead to the law in this sense, that she may be married to another who rose from the dead, she makes this distinction without any reproach to the law, which would be blasphemy against its author. This is thy crime; for though the apostle tells thee that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good, thou dost not acknowledge it as the production of a good being. Its author thou makest to be one of the princes of darkness. Here the truth confronts thee. They are the words of the Apostle Paul: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" Such is the law given by Him who appointed for a great symbolical use the tablets which thou foolishly deridest. The same law which was given by Moses becomes through Jesus Christ grace and truth; for the spirit is joined to the letter, that the righteousness of the law might begin to be fulfilled, which when unfulfilled only added the guilt of transgression. The law which is holy, and just, and good, is the same law by which sin works death, and to which we must die, that we may be married to another who rose from the dead. Hear what the apostle adds: \"But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.\" Deaf and blind, dost thou not now hear and see? \"Sin wrought death in me,\" he says, \"by that which is good.\" The law is always good: whether it hurts those who are destitute of grace, or benefits those who are filled with grace, itself is always good; as the sun is always good, for every creature of God is good, whether it hurts weak eyes or gladdens the sight of the healthy. Grace fits the mind for keeping the law, as health fits the eyes for seeing the sun. And as healthy eyes die not to the pleasure of seeing the sun, but to that painful effect of the rays which beat upon the eye so as to increase the darkness; so the mind, healed by the love of the spirit, dies not to the justice of the law, but to the guilt and transgression which followed on the law in the absence of grace. So it is said \"The law is good, if used lawfully;\" and immediately after of the same law, \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man.\" The man who delights in righteousness itself, does not require the restraint of the letter.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But let him inform us how it was that his[fn-42-P4215_1591457:54-nf] soul would be cut off from his people if he had not been circumcised on the eighth day.

I repeat his words once more: \"You assert,\" says he to me, \"that they, indeed, who have not been ever born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the world, and for whom Christ died, you decide to be the work of the devil, born in a disordered state, and guilty from the very beginning.\" Would that he only solved the entire controversy as he unties the knot of this question! For will he pretend to say that he merely spoke of adults in this passage? Why, the subject in hand is about infants, about human beings at their birth; and it is about these that he raises odium against us, because they are defined by us as guilty from the very first, because we declare them to be guilty, since Christ died for them. And why did Christ die for them if they are not guilty? It is entirely from them, yes, from them, we shall find the reason, wherefore he thought odium should be raised against me. He asks: \"How are infants guilty, for whom Christ died?\" We answer: Nay, how are infants not guilty, since Christ died for them? This dispute wants a judge to determine it. Let Christ be the Judge, and let Him tell us what is the object which has profited by His death? \"This is my blood,\" He says, \"which shall be shed[fn-43-P4390_1668446:133-nf] for many for the remission of sins.\"[fn-43-P4391_1668502:134-nf] Let the apostle, too, be His assessor in the judgment; since even in the apostle it is Christ Himself that speaks. Speaking of God the Father, he exclaims: \"He who spared. not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all!\"[fn-43-P4392_1668748:135-nf] I suppose that he describes Christ as so delivered up for us all, that infants in this matter are not separated from ourselves. But what need is there to dwell on this point, out of which even he no longer raises a contest? For the truth is, he not only confesses that Christ died even for infants, but he also reproves us out of this admission, because we say that these same infants are guilty for whom Christ died. Now, then, let the apostle, who says that Christ was delivered up for us all, also tell us why Christ was delivered up for us. \"He was delivered,\" says he, \"for our offences, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-43-P4393_1669402:136-nf] If, therefore, as even this man both confesses and professes, both admits and objects, infants, too, are included amongst those for whom Christ was delivered up; and if it was for our sins that Christ was delivered up, even infants, of course, must have original sins, for whom Christ was delivered up; He must have something in them to heal, who (as Himself affirms) is not needed as a Physician by the whole, but by the sick;[fn-43-P4394_1669850:137-nf] He must have a reason for saving them, seeing that He came into the world, as the Apostle Paul says, \"to save sinners;\"[fn-43-P4395_1669992:138-nf] He must have something in them to remit, who testifies that He shed His blood \"for the remission of sins;\"[fn-43-P4396_1670120:139-nf] He must have good reason for seeking them out, who \"came,\" as He says, \"to seek and to save that which was lost;\"[fn-43-P4397_1670257:140-nf] the Son of man must find in them something to destroy, who came for the express purpose, as the Apostle John says, \"that He might destroy the works of the devil.\"[fn-43-P4398_1670441:141-nf] Now to this salvation of infants He must be an enemy, who asserts their innocence, in such a way as to deny them the medicine which is required by the hurt and wounded.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"29.

Such a circumcised proselyte might have been addressed in the words of Paul: \"Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law.\"[fn-17-P1744_983011:60-nf] His imitation of the Pharisees in not keeping the law made him a child of hell. And he was twofold more than they, probably because of his neglecting to fulfill what he voluntarily undertook, when, not being born a Jew, he chose to become a Jew.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"This, then, was the meaning of his safe guidance on the way to what he sought-that he was not blindly led by any of the means ready to hand for his instruction in the things of God, and that his mind, unimpeded by any object of sense, was never hindered from its journeying in quest of what lies beyond all that is known, but having gone by reasoning far beyond the wisdom of his countrymen, (I mean the philosophy of the Chaldees, limited as it was to the things which do appear,) and soaring above the things which are cognizable by sense, from the beauty of the objects of contemplation, and the harmony of the heavenly wonders, he desired to behold the archetype of all beauty.

The prohibition increased the lust, and made it unconquered:[fn-35-P3599_1700653:19-nf] that there might be transgression also, which without the Law was not, although there was sin, \"For where there is not Law, neither is there transgression.\"[fn-36-P3600_1700828:20-nf] Thus the Law, Grace not helping, forbidding sin, became over and above the strength of sin; whence the Apostle saith, \"The Law is the strength of sin.\"[fn-36-P3601_1700998:21-nf] Nor is it to be wondered at, that man's weakness even from the good Law added strength to evil, whilst it trusts to fulfill the Law itself of its own strength.

The object, therefore, of the faith whereby the just man shall live, will be that same God to whom likewise belongs the law, by doing which no man is justified. Since, then, there equally are found the curse in the law and the blessing in faith, you have both conditions set forth by[fn-72-P7263_2100163:114-nf] the Creator: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I have set before you a blessing and a curse.\"[fn-72-P7264_2100256:115-nf] You cannot establish a diversity of authors because there happens to be one of things; for the diversity is itself proposed by one and the same author. Why, however, \"Christ was made a curse for us,\"[fn-72-P7265_2100477:116-nf] is declared by the apostle himself in a way which quite helps our side, as being the result of the Creator's appointment. But yet it by no means follows, because the Creator said of old, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,\"[fn-72-P7266_2100731:117-nf] that Christ belonged to another god, and on that account was accursed even then in the law. And how, indeed, could the Creator have cursed by anticipation one whom He knew not of? Why, however, may it not be more suitable for the Creator to have delivered His own Son to His own curse, than to have submitted Him to the malediction of that god of yours,-in behalf, too, of man, who is an alien to him? Now, if this appointment of the Creator respecting His Son appears to you to be a cruel one, it is equally so in the case of your own god; if, on the contrary, it be in accordance with reason in your god, it is equally so-nay, much more so-in mine. For it would be more credible that that God had provided blessing for man, through the curse of Christ, who formerly set both a blessing and a curse before man, than that he had done so, who, according to you,[fn-72-P7267_2101673:118-nf] never at any time pronounced either. \"We have received therefore, the promise of the Spirit,\" as the apostle says, \"through faith,\" even that faith by which the just man lives, in accordance with the Creator's purpose.[fn-72-P7268_2101908:119-nf] What I say, then, is this, that that God is the object of faith who prefigured the grace of faith.

But how are we children of faith? and of whose faith, if not Abraham's? For since \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness; \"[fn-72-P7271_2102581:122-nf] since, also, he deserved for that reason to be called \"the father of many nations,\" whilst we, who are even more like him[fn-72-P7272_2102723:123-nf] in believing in God, are thereby justified as Abraham was, and thereby also obtain life-since the just lives by his faith,-it therefore happens that, as he in the previous passage called us \"sons of Abraham,\" since he is in faith our (common) father,[fn-72-P7273_2103072:124-nf] so here also he named us \"children of faith,\" for it was owing to his faith that it was promised that Abraham should be the father of (many) nations.

For the woman which is under a husband is joined to her husband by the law so long as he liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband.\"[fn-51-P5100_2007372:36-nf] And a little after: \"Therefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that ye should belong to another, who has risen from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins which are by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death, but now we are delivered from the law of death in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.\"[fn-51-P5101_2007882:37-nf] With these and such like testimonies that teacher of the Gentiles showed with sufficient evidence that the law could not take away sin, but rather increased it, and that grace takes it away; since the law knew how to command, to which command weakness gives way, while grace knows to assist, whereby love is infused.[fn-51-P5102_2008220:38-nf] And lest any one, on account of these testimonies, should reproach the law, and contend that it is evil, the apostle, seeing what might occur to those who ill understand it, himself proposed to himself the same question. \"What shall we say, then?\" said he. \"Is the law sin? Far from it. But I did not know sin except by the law.\"[fn-51-P5103_2008587:39-nf] He had already said before, \"For by the law is the knowledge of sin.\" It is not, therefore, the taking away, but the knowledge of sin.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us see, however, why the words are added, \"And without Him was not anything (Gr. even one thing) made.\" Some might think it superfluous to add to the words \"All things were made through Him,\" the phrase \"Without Him was not anything made.\" For if everything whatsoever was made through the Logos, then nothing was made without Him. Yet it does not follow from the proposition that without the Logos nothing was made, that all things were made through the Logos. It is possible that though nothing was made without the Logos, all things were made, not through the Logos only, but some things by Him. We must, therefore, make ourselves sure in what sense the \"all things\" is to be understood, and in what sense the \"nothing.\" For, without a clear preliminary definition of these terms, it might be maintained that, if all things were made through the Logos, and evil is a part of all things, then the whole matter of sin, and everything that is wicked, that these also were made through the Logos. But this we must regard as false. There is nothing absurd in thinking that creatures were made through the Logos, and also that men's brave deeds have been done through Him, and all the useful acts of those who are now in bliss; but with the sins and misfortunes of men it is otherwise. Now some have held that since evil is not based in the constitution of things-for it did not exist at the beginning and at the end it will have ceased-that, therefore, the evils of which we spoke are the Nothing; and as some of the Greeks say that genera and forms, such as the (general) animal and the man, belong to the category of Nothings, so it has been supposed that all that is not of God is Nothing, and has not even obtained through the Word the subsistence it appears to have. We ask whether it is possible to show from Scripture in any convincing way that this is so. As for the meanings of the word \"Nothing\" and \"Not-being,\" they would appear to be synonymous, for Nothing can be spoken of as Not-being, and the Not-being can be described as Nothing. The Apostle, however, appears to count the things which are not, not among those which have no existence whatever, but rather among things which are evil. To him the Not-being is evil; \"God,\" he says,[fn-64-P6474_1088305:31-nf] \"called the things that are not as things that are.\" And Mardochaeus, too, in the Esther of the Septuagint, calls the enemies of Israel \"those that are not,\" saying,[fn-64-P6475_1088489:32-nf] \"Deliver not Thy sceptre, O Lord, to those that are not.\" We may also notice how evil men, on account of their wickedness, are said not to be, from the name ascribed to God in Exodus:[fn-64-P6476_1088692:33-nf] \"For the Lord said to Moses, I am, that is My name.\" The good God says this with respect of us also who pray that we may be part of His congregation. The Saviour praises him, saying,[fn-64-P6477_1088899:34-nf] \"None is good but one, God the Father.\" The good, then, is the same as He who is. Over against good is evil or wickedness, and over against Him who is that which is not, whence it follows that evil and wickedness are that which is not. This, perhaps, is what has led some to affirm that the devil is not created by God. In respect that he is the devil he is not the work of God, but he who is the devil is a created being, and as there is no other creator but our God, he is a work of God. It is as if we should say that a murderer is not a work of God, while we may say that in respect he is a man, God made him. His being as a man he received from God; we do not assert that he received from God his being as a murderer. All, then, who have part in Him who is, and the saints have part in Him, may properly be called Beings; but those who have given up their part in the Being, by depriving themselves of Being, have become Not-beings. But we said when entering on this discussion, that Not-being and Nothing are synonymous, and hence those who are not beings are Nothing, and all evil is nothing, since it is Not-being, and thus since they are called Not-being came into existence without the Logos, not being numbered among the all things which were made through Him. Thus we have shown, so far as our powers admit, what are the \"all things\" which were made through the Logos, and what came into existence without Him, since at no time is it Being, and it is, therefore, called \"Nothing.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_32_on_infants_early_deaths","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"That nothing happens without God we know from many sources; and, reversely, that God's dispensations have no element of chance and confusion in them every one will allow, who realizes that God is Reason, and Wisdom, and Perfect Goodness, and Truth, and could not admit of that which is not good and not consistent with His Truth[fn-29-P2964_2002904:45-nf] . Whether, then, the early deaths of infants are to be attributed to the aforesaid causes, or whether there is some further cause of them beyond these, it befits us to acknowledge that these things happen for the best. I have another reason also to give which I have learnt from the wisdom of an Apostle; a reason, that is, why some of those who have been distinguished for their wickedness have been suffered to live on in their self-chosen course. Having expanded a thought of this kind at some length in his argument to the Romans[fn-29-P2965_2003630:46-nf] , and having retorted upon himself with the counter-conclusion, which thence necessarily follows, that the sinner could no longer be justly blamed, if his sinning is a dispensation of God, and that he would not have existed at all, if it had been contrary to the wishes of Him Who has the world in His power, the Apostle meets this conclusion and solves this counter-plea by means of a still deeper view of things. He tells us that God, in rendering to every one his due, sometimes even grants a scope to wickedness for good in the end. Therefore He allowed the King of Egypt, for example, to be born and to grow up such as he was; the intention was that Israel, that great nation exceeding all calculation by numbers, might be instructed by his disaster. God's omnipotence is to be recognized in every direction; it has strength to bless the deserving; it is not inadequate to the punishment of wickedness[fn-29-P2966_2004613:47-nf] ; and so, as the complete removal of that peculiar people out of Egypt was necessary in order to prevent their receiving any infection from the sins of Egypt in a misguided way of living, therefore that God-defying and infamous Pharaoh rose and reached his maturity in the lifetime of the very people who were to be benefited, so that Israel might acquire a just knowledge of the two-fold energy of God, working as it did in either direction; the more beneficent they learnt in their own persons, the sterner by seeing it exercised upon those who were being scourged for their wickedness; for in His consummate wisdom God can mould even evil into co-operation with good. The artisan (if the Apostle's argument may be confirmed by any words of ours)-the artisan who by his skill has to fashion iron to some instrument for daily use, has need not only of that which owing to its natural ductility lends itself to his art, but, be the iron never so hard, be it never so difficult to soften it in the fire, be it even impossible owing to its adamantine resistance to mould it into any useful implement, his art requires the co-operation even of this; he will use it for an anvil, upon which the soft workable iron may be beaten and formed into something useful. But some one will say, \"It is not all who thus reap in this life the fruits of their wickedness, any more than all those whose lives have been virtuous profit while living by their virtuous endeavours; what then, I ask, is the advantage of their existence in the case of these who live to the end unpunished?\" I will bring forward to meet this question of yours a reason which transcends all human arguments. Somewhere in his utterances the great David declares that some portion of the blessedness of the virtuous will consist in this; in contemplating side by side with their own felicity the perdition of the reprobate. He says, \"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the ungodly[fn-29-P2967_2006721:48-nf] \"; not indeed as rejoicing over the torments of those sufferers, but as then most completely realizing the extent of the well-earned rewards of virtue. He signifies by those words that it will be an addition to the felicity of the virtuous and an intensification of it, to have its contrary set against it. In saying that \"he washes his hands in the blood of the ungodly\" he would convey the thought that \"the cleanness of his own acting in life is plainly declared in the perdition of the ungodly.\" For the expression \"wash\" represents the idea of cleanness; but no one is washed, but is rather defiled, in blood; whereby it is clear that it is a comparison with the harsher forms of punishment that puts in a clearer light the blessedness of virtue. We must now summarize our argument, in order that the thoughts which we have expanded may be more easily retained in the memory. The premature deaths of infants have nothing in them to suggest the thought that one who so terminates his life is subject to some grievous misfortune, any more than they are to be put on a level with the deaths of those who have purified themselves in this life by every kind of virtue; the more far-seeing Providence of God curtails the immensity of sins in the case of those whose lives are going to be so evil. That some of the wicked have lived on[fn-29-P2968_2008075:49-nf] does not upset this reason which we have rendered; for the evil was in their case hindered in kindness to their parents; whereas, in the case of those whose parents have never imparted to them any power of calling upon God, such a form of the Divine kindness[fn-29-P2969_2008410:50-nf] , which accompanies such a power, is not transmitted to their own children; otherwise the infant now prevented by death from growing up wicked would have exhibited a far more desperate wickedness than the most notorious sinners, seeing that it would have been unhindered. Even granting that some have climbed to the topmost pinnacle of crime, the Apostolic view supplies a comforting answer to the question; for He Who does everything with Wisdom knows how to effect by means of evil some good. Still further, if some occupy a pre-eminence in crime, and yet for all that have never been a metal, to use our former illustration, that God's skill has used for any good, this is a case which constitutes an addition to the happiness of the good, as the Prophet's words suggest; it may be reckoned as not a slight element in that happiness, nor, on the other hand, as one unworthy of God's providing.

Now this election the Apostle demonstrating to be, not of merits going before in good works, but election of grace, saith thus: \"And in this time a remnant by election of grace is saved. But if by grace, then is itno more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-47-P4787_2358854:46-nf] This is election of grace; that is, election in which through the grace of God men are elected: this, I say, is election of grace which goes before all good merits of men. For if it be to any good merits that it is given, then is it no more gratuitously given, but is paid as a debt, and consequently is not truly called grace; where \"reward,\" as the same Apostle saith, \"is not imputed as grace, but as debt.\"[fn-47-P4788_2359285:47-nf] Whereas if, that it may be true grace, that is, gratuitous, it find nothing inman to which it is due of merit, (which thing is well understood in that saying, \"Thou wiltsave them for nothing,\"[fn-47-P4789_2359495:48-nf] ) then assuredly itself gives the merits, not to merits is given. Consequently it goes before even faith, from which it is that all good works begin. \"For the just,\" as is written, \"shall live by faith.\"[fn-47-P4790_2359822:49-nf] But, moreover, grace not only assists the just, but also justifies the ungodly. And therefore even when it does aid the just and seems to be rendered to his merits, not even then does it cease to be grace, because that which it aids it did itself bestow. With a view therefore to this grace, which precedes all good merits of man, not only was Christ put to death by the ungodly, but \"died for the ungodly.\"[fn-47-P4791_2360249:50-nf] And ere that He died, He elected the Apostles, not of course then just, but to be justified: to whom He saith, \"I have chosen you out of the world.\" For to whom He said, \"Ye are not of the world,\" and then, lest they should account themselves never to have been of the world, presently added, \"But I have chosen you out of the world;\" assuredly that they should not be of the world was by His own election of them conferred upon them. Wherefore, if it had been through their own righteousness, not through His grace, that they were elected, they would not have been chosen out of the world, because they would already not be of the world if already they were just. And again, if the reason why they were elected was, that they were already just, they had already first chosen the Lord. For who can be righteous but by choosing righteousness? \"But the end of the law is Christ, for righteousness is to every one that believeth.[fn-47-P4792_2361192:51-nf] Who is made unto us wisdom of God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-47-P4793_2361368:52-nf] He then is Himself our righteousness.","title":"On Patience","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This is what we say; this is that about which they object to us that we say \"that the law was so given as to be a cause of greater sin.\" They do not hear the apostle saying, \"For the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression;\"[fn-53-P5397_2116975:9-nf] and, \"The law was added for the sake of transgression until the seed should come to whom the promise was made;\"[fn-53-P5398_2117104:10-nf] and, \"If there had been a law given which could have given life, righteousness should altogether have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-53-P5399_2117370:11-nf] Hence it is that the Old Testament, from the Mount Sinai, where the law was given, gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. \"Now we,\" says he, \"are not children of the bondmaid but of the freewoman.\"[fn-54-P5400_2117589:12-nf] Therefore they are not children of the freewoman who have accepted the law of the letter, whereby they can be shown to be not only sinners, but moreover transgressors; but they who have received the Spirit of grace, whereby the law itself, holy and just and good, may be fulfilled.

Or, if it must be understood more highly, that \"He who doeth these things shall live in them\" was written in reference to eternal life; the power of the law is so expressed that the weakness of man in himself, itself failing to do what the law commands, might seek help from the grace of God rather of faith, seeing that by His mercy even faith itself is bestowed.

The first begins with \"This was He of whom I said, He that cometh after me,\" and goes down to \"The only-begotten Son of God who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared him.\" Heracleon supposes the words, \"No one has seen God at any time,\" etc., to have been spoken, not by the Baptist, but by the disciple. But in this he is not sound. He himself allows the words, \"Of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace; for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,\" to have been spoken by the Baptist. And does it not follow that the person who received of the fulness of Christ, and a second grace in addition to that he had before, and who declared the law to have been given by Moses, but grace and truth to have come through Jesus Christ, is it not clear that this is the person who understood, from what he received from the fulness of Christ, how \"no one hath seen God at any time,\" and how \"the only-begotten who is in the bosom of the Father\" had delivered the declaration about God to him and to all those who had received of His fulness? He was not declaring here for the first time Him that is in the bosom of the Father, as if there had never before been any one fit to receive what he told His Apostles. Does he not teach us that he was before Abraham, and that Abraham rejoiced and was glad to see his day? The words \"Of his fulness all we received,\" and \"Grace for grace,\" show, as we have already made clear, that the prophets also received their gift from the fulness of Christ and received a second grace in place of that they had before; for they also, led by the Spirit, advanced from the introduction they had in types to the vision of truth. Hence not all the prophets, but many of them,[fn-67-P6703_1183785:7-nf] desired to see the things, which the Apostles saw. For if there was a difference among the prophets, those who were perfect and more distinguished of them did not desire to see what the Apostles saw, but actually beheld them, while those who rose less fully than these to the height of the Word were filled with longing for the things which the Apostles knew through Christ. The word \"saw\" we have not taken in a physical sense, and the word \"heard\" we have taken to refer to a spiritual communication; only he who has ears is prepared to hear the words of Jesus-a thing which does not happen too frequently. There is the further point, that the saints before the bodily advent of Jesus had an advantage over most believers in their insight into the mysteries of divinity, since the Word of God was their teacher before He became flesh, for He was always working , in imitation of His Father, of whom He says, \"My father worketh hitherto.\" On this point we may adduce the words He addresses to the Sadducees, who do not believe the doctrine of the resurrection. \"Have you not read,\" He says,[fn-67-P6704_1184897:8-nf] \"what is said by God at the Bush, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" If, then, God is not ashamed to be called the God of these men, and if they are counted by Christ among the living, and if all believers are sons of Abraham,[fn-67-P6705_1185225:9-nf] since all the Gentiles are blessed with faithful Abraham, who is appointed by God to be a father of the Gentiles, can we hesitate to admit that those living persons made acquaintance with the learning of living men, and were taught by Christ who was born before the daystar,[fn-67-P6706_1185517:10-nf] before He became flesh? And for this cause they lived, because they had part in Him who said, \"I am the life,\" and as the heirs of so great promises received the vision, not only of angels, but of God in Christ. For they saw, it may be, the image of the invisible God,[fn-67-P6707_1185802:11-nf] since he who hath seen the Son hath seen the Father, and so they are recorded to have known God, and to have heard God's words worthily, and, therefore, to have seen God and heard Him. Now, I consider that those who are fully and really sons of Abraham are sons of his actions, spiritually understood, and of the knowledge which was made manifest to him. What he knew and what he did appears again in those who are his sons, as the Scripture teaches those who have ears to hear,[fn-67-P6708_1186315:12-nf] \"If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.\" And if it is a true proverb[fn-67-P6709_1186435:13-nf] which says, \"A wise man will understand that which proceeds from his own mouth, and on his lips he will bear prudence,\" then we must at once repudiate some things which have been said about the prophets, as if they were not wise men, and did not understand what proceeded from their own mouths. We must believe what is good and true about the prophets, that they were sages, that they did understand what proceeded from their mouths, and that they bore prudence on their lips. It is clear indeed that Moses understood in his mind the truth (real meaning) of the law, and the higher interpretations of the stories recorded in his books. Joshua, too, understood the meaning of the allotment of the land after the destruction of the nine and twenty kings, and could see better than we can the realities of which his achievements were the shadows. It is clear, too, that Isaiah saw the mystery of Him who sat upon the throne, and of the two seraphim, and of the veiling of their faces and their feet, and of their wings, and of the altar and of the tongs. Ezekiel, too, understood the true significance of the cherubim and of their goings, and of the firmament that was above them, and of Him that sat on the throne, than all which what could be loftier or more splendid? I need not enter into more particulars; the point I aim at establishing is clear enough already, namely, that those who were made perfect in earlier generations knew not less than the Apostles did of what Christ revealed to them, since the same teacher was with them as He who revealed to the Apostles the unspeakable mysteries of godliness. I will add but a few points, and then leave it to the reader to judge and to form what views he pleases on this subject. Paul says in his Epistle to the Romans,[fn-67-P6710_1188226:14-nf] \"Now, to him who is able to establish you according to my Gospel, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal, but is now made manifest by the prophetic Scriptures and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" For if the mystery concealed of old is made manifest to the Apostles through the prophetic writings, and if the prophets, being wise men, understood what proceeded from their own mouths, then the prophets knew what was made manifest to the Apostles. But to many it was not revealed, as Paul says,[fn-67-P6711_1188800:15-nf] \"In other generations it was not made known to the sons of men as it hath now been revealed unto His holy Apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and members of the same body.\" Here an objection may be raised by those who do not share the view we have propounded; and it becomes of importance to define what is meant by the word \"revealed.\" It is capable of two meanings: firstly, that the thing in question is understood, but secondly, if a prophecy is spoken of, that it is accomplished. Now, the fact that the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise, was known to the prophets to this extent, that they knew the Gentiles were to fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ. When this should be, and why, and what Gentiles were spoken of, and how, though strangers from the covenants. and aliens to the promises, they were yet to be members of one body and sharers of the blessings; all this was known to the prophets, being revealed to them. But the things prophesied belong to the future, and are not revealed to those who know them, but do not witness their fulfilment, as they are to those who have the event before their eyes. And this was the position of the Apostles. Thus, I conceive. they knew the events no more than the fathers and the prophets did; and yet it is truly said of them that \"what to other generations was not revealed was now revealed to the Apostles and prophets, that the Gentiles were fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers in the promise of Christ.\" For, in addition to knowing these mysteries, they saw the power at work in the accomplished fact. The passage, \"Many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things ye see and did not see them; and to hear the things ye hear and did not hear them,\" may be interpreted in the same way. They also desired to see the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God, and of His coming down to carry out the design of His suffering for the salvation of many, actually put in operation. This may be illustrated from another quarter. Suppose one of the Apostles to have understood the \"unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-67-P6712_1191085:16-nf] but not to witness the glorious bodily appearing of Jesus to the faithful. which is promised, although He desired to see it and suppose another had not only not[fn-67-P6713_1191266:17-nf] marked and seen what that Apostle marked and saw, but had a much feebler grasp of the divine hope, and yet is present at the second coming of our Saviour, which the Apostle, as in the parallel above, had desired, but had not seen. We shall not err from the truth if we say that both of these have seen what the Apostle, or indeed the Apostles, desired to see, and yet that they are not on that account to be deemed wiser or more blessed than the Apostles. In the same way, also, the Apostles are not to be deemed wiser than the fathers, or than Moses and the prophets, than those in fact who, for their virtue, were found worthy of epiphanies and ofdivine manifestations and of revelations of mysteries.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Then, again, there is the Scripture containedin the second book of the Chronicles: \"TheLord is with you when ye are with Him: and if ye shall seek Him ye shall find Him; but if ye forsake Him, He also will forsake you.\"[fn-59-P5983_2333662:68-nf] his passage, no doubt, clearly manifests the choice of the will.

Shall you call these cures, counsels, methods of judging, spectacles, (illustrations of) even the barbarity of God? Does God covet man's blood? And yet I might venture to affirm that He does, if man also covets the kingdom of heaven, if man covets a sure salvation, if man also covets a second new birth.

Remember that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ both died for us, and rose again; died, to wit, for our offenses, rose again for our justification.[fn-40-P4056_2225496:2-nf] Even as ye have just heard concerning the two disciples whom He met with in the way, how \"their eyes were holden that they should not know Him:\"[fn-40-P4057_2225658:3-nf] and He found them despairing of the redemption that was in Christ, and deeming that now He had suffered and was dead as a man, not accounting that as Son of God He ever liveth; and deeming too that He was so dead in the flesh as not to come to life again, but just as one of the prophets: as those of you who were attentive have just now heard their own words. Then\"He opened to them the Scriptures, beginning at Moses,\" and going through all the prophets, showing them that all He had suffered had been foretold, lest they should be more staggered if the Lord should rise again, and the more fail to believe Him, if these things had not been told before concerning Him. For the firmness of faith is in this, that all things which came to pass in Christ were foretold. The disciples, then, knew Him not, save \"in the breaking of bread.\" And truly he that eateth and drinketh not judgment to himself in the breaking of bread doth know Christ.[fn-40-P4058_2226621:4-nf] Afterward also those eleven \"thought they saw a spirit.\" He gave Himself to be handled by them, who also gave Himself to be crucified; to be crucified by enemies, to be handled by friends: yet the Physician of all, both of the ungodliness of those, and of the unbelief of these.

For if those believed only because they held and handled, what shall we do? Now, Christ is ascended into heaven; He is not to come save at the end, to judge the quick and the dead. Whereby shall we believe, but by that whereby it was His will that even those who handled Him should be confirmed? For He opened to them the Scriptures and showed them that it behoved Christ to suffer, and that all things should be fulfilled which were written of Him in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms.

What is the top in the erection of that building which we are constructing? Whither will the highest point of this building reach? I say at once, even to the Vision of God. Ye see how high, how great a thing it is to see God. Whoso longeth after it, understands both what I say and what he hears. The Vision of God is promised to us, of the very God, the Supreme God. For this is good, to see Him who seeth. For they who worship false gods, see them easily; but they see them \"who have eyes andsee not.\" But to us is promised the Vision of the Living and the Seeing God, that we may desire eagerly to see that God of whom Scripture saith, \"He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, doth he not consider?\"[fn-38-P3829_1659513:5-nf] Doth He then not hear, who hath made for thee that whereby thou hearest? and doth not He see, who hath created that whereby thou seest?

For as great piety belongs but to the few, no less also does great impiety. But the multitude of men speak thus: What! is God thinking now upon this, that He should know what I am doing in my house, and does God care for what I may choose to do upon my bed? Who says this? \"Understand, ye unwise among the people, and ye fools at length be wise.\" Because as being a man, it is a labour for thee to know all that takes place in thy house, and for all the doings and words of thy servants to reach thee; thinkest thou that it is a like labour for God to observe thee, who did not labour to create thee? Doth not He fix His eye upon thee, who made thine eye? Thou wast not, and He created thee and gave thee being; and doth not He care for thee now that thou art, who \"calleth those things which be not as though they were\"?[fn-38-P3832_1661094:8-nf] Do not then promise thyself this.

Hard labour truly! Daily art thou wishing to do evil, and dost thou suspect that thou art not seen? Hear the Scripture which saith, \"He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, doth not He consider?\" Where canst thou hide thy evil deeds from the eyes of God? If thou wilt not depart from them, thy labour is great indeed.","title":"Sermon XIX. [LXIX.

And if any one seek for divine authority in this matter, though what is held by the whole Church, and that not as instituted by Councils, but as a matter of invariable custom, is rightly held to have been handed down by apostolical authority, still we can form a true conjecture of the value of the sacrament of baptism in the case of infants, from the parallel of circumcision, which was received by God's earlier people, and before receiving which Abraham was justified, as Cornelius also was enriched with the gift of the Holy Spirit before he was baptized. Yet the apostle says of Abraham himself, that \"he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith,\" having already believed in his heart, so that \"it was counted unto him for righteousness.\"[fn-36-P3618_2026883:132-nf] Why, therefore, was it commanded him that he should circumcise every male child in order on the eighth day,[fn-36-P3619_2027014:133-nf] though it could not yet believe with the heart, that it should be counted unto it for righteousness, because the sacrament in itself was of great avail? And this was made manifest by the message of an angel in the case of Moses' son; for when he was carried by his mother, being yet uncircumcised, it was required, by manifest present peril, that he should be circumcised,[fn-36-P3620_2027411:134-nf] and when this was done, the danger of death was removed. As therefore in Abraham the justification of faith came first, and circumcision was added afterwards as the seal of faith; so in Cornelius the spiritual sanctification came first in the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the sacrament of regeneration was added afterwards in the laver of baptism. And as in Isaac, who was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, the seal of this righteousness of faith was given first, and afterwards, as he imitated the faith of his father, the righteousness itself followed as he grew up, of which the seal had been given before when he was an infant; so in infants, who are baptized, the sacrament of regeneration is given first, and if they maintain a Christian piety, conversion also in the heart will follow, of which the mysterious sign had gone before in the outward body. And as in the thief the gracious goodness of the Almighty supplied what had been wanting in the sacrament of baptism, because it had been missing not from pride or contempt, but from want of opportunity; so in infants who die baptized, we must believe that the same grace of the Almighty supplies the want, that, not from perversity of will, but from insufficiency of age, they can neither believe with the heart unto righteousness, nor make confession with the mouth unto salvation. Therefore, when others take the vows for them, that the celebration of the sacrament may be complete in their behalf, it is unquestionably of avail for their dedication to God, because they cannot answer for themselves. But if another were to answer for one who could answer for himself, it would not be of the same avail. In accordance with which rule, we find in the gospel what strikes every one as natural when he reads it, \"He is of age, he shall speak for himself.\"[fn-36-P3621_2029262:135-nf] Chap. 25.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Mistake is a sin contrary to calculation; and voluntary sin is crime (a0diki/a); and crime is voluntary wickedness.

You evidently, therefore, understood that the blood of the soul was shed in spiritual murder by the sword of schism, which you condemned in Maximianus. See then if your feet are not swift to shed blood, when you cut off men from the unity of the whole world, if you were right in saying it of the followers of Maximianus, because they cut off some from the party of Donatus. Are we again without the knowledge of the way of peace, who study to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace? and yet do you possess that knowledge, who resist the discourse which Christ held with His disciples after His resurrection, of so peaceful a nature that He began it with the greeting, \"Peace be unto you;\"[fn-48-P4836_2380581:50-nf] and that so strenuously that you are proved to be saying nothing less to Him than this, \"What Thou saidst of the unity of all nations is false; what we say of the offense of all nations is true\"? Who would say such things as this if they had the fear of God before their eyes? See, therefore, if in daily saying things like this you are not trying to destroy the people of God dispersed throughout the world, eating them up as it were bread.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_65_book_v_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For, in fine, the agreement and harmony of the faith of both[fn-71-P7199_2191340:3-nf] contribute to one end-salvation.

Now we know that neither things which are clear are made subjects of investigation, such as if it is day, while it is day; nor things unknown, and never destined to become clear, as whether the stars are even or odd in number; nor things convertible; and those are so which can be said equally by those who take the opposite side, as if what is in the womb is a living creature or not. A fourth mode is, when, from either side of those, there is advanced an unanswerable and irrefragable argument. If, then, the ground of inquiry, according to all of these modes, is removed, faith is established. For we advance to them the unanswerable consideration, that it is God who speaks and comes to our help in writing, respecting each one of the points regarding which I investigate. Who, then, is so impious as to disbelieve God, and to demand proofs from God as from men? Again, some questions demand the evidence of the senses,[fn-72-P7212_2196612:14-nf] as if one were to ask whether the fire be warm, or the snow white; and some admonition and rebuke, as the question if you ought to honour your parents. And there are those that deserve punishment, as to ask proofs of the existence of Providence. There being then a Providence, it were impious to think that the whole of prophecy and the economy in reference to a Saviour did not take place in accordance with Providence. And perchance one should not even attempt to demonstrate such points, the divine Providence being evident from the sight of all its skilful and wise works which. are seen, some of which take place in order, and some appear in order. And He who communicated to us being and life, has communicated to us also reason, wishing us to live rationally and rightly. For the Word of the Father of the universe is not the uttered word (lo/goj proforiko/j), but the wisdom and most manifest kindness of God, and His power too, which is almighty and truly divine, and not incapable of being conceived by those who do not confes\"-the all-potent will. But since some are unbelieving, and some are disputations, all do not attain to the perfection of the good. For neither is it possible to attain it without the exercise of free choice; nor does the whole depend on our own purpose; as, for example, what is defined to happen.\"For by grace we are saved: \"not, indeed, without good works; but we must, by being formed for what is good, acquire an inclination for it. And we must possess the healthy mind which is fixed on the pursuit of the good; in order to which we have the greatest need of divine grace, and of right teaching, and of holy susceptibility, and of the drawing of the Father to Him. For, bound in this earthly body, we apprehend the objects of sense by means of the body; but we grasp intellectual objects by means of the logical faculty itself. But if one expect to apprehend all things by the senses, he has fallen far from the truth. Spiritually, therefore, the apostle writes respecting the knowledge of God, \"For now we see as through a glass, but then face to face.\"[fn-72-P7213_2198788:15-nf] For the vision of the truth is given but to few. Accordingly, Plato says in the Epinomis, \"I do not say that it is possible for all to be blessed and happy; only a few. Whilst we live, I pronounce this to be the case. But there is a good hope that after death I shall attain all.\" To the same effect is what we find in Moses: \"No man shall see My face, and live.\"[fn-72-P7214_2199174:16-nf] For it is evident that no one during the period of life has been able to apprehend God clearly. But\" the pure in heart shall see God,\"[fn-72-P7215_2199330:17-nf] when they arrive at the final perfection. For since the soul became too enfeebled for the apprehension of realities, we needed a divine teacher. The Saviour is sent down-a teacher and leader in the acquisition of the good-the secret and sacred token of the great Providence. \"Where, then, is the scribe? where is the searcher of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? \"[fn-72-P7216_2199742:18-nf] it is said. And again, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent,\"[fn-72-P7217_2199880:19-nf] plainly of those wise in their own eyes, and disputatious. Excellently therefore Jeremiah says, \"Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and ask for the eternal paths,\"what is the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find expiation for your souls.\"[fn-72-P7218_2200150:20-nf] Ask, he says, and inquire of those who know, without contention and dispute. And on learning the way of truth, let us walk on the right way, without turning till we attain to what we desire: It was therefore with reason that the king of the Romans (his name was Numa), being a Pythagorean, first of all men, erected a temple to Faith and Peace. \"And to Abraham, on believing, righteousness was reckoned.\"[fn-72-P7219_2200573:21-nf] He, prosecuting the lofty philosophy of aerial phenomena, and the sublime philosophy of the movements in the heavens, was called Abram, which is interpreted \"sublime father.\"[fn-72-P7220_2200775:22-nf] But afterwards, on looking up to heaven, whether it was that he saw the Son in the spirit, as some explain, or a glorious angel, or in any other way recognised God to be superior to the creation, and all the order in it, he receives in addition the Alpha, the knowledge of the one and only God, and is called Abraam, having, instead of a natural philosopher, become wise, and a lover of God. For it is interpreted, \"elect father of sound.\" For by sound is the uttered word: the mind is its father; and the mind of the good man is elect.

For what I just now said is put with the greatest clearness in that very epistle of mine, in answering which he has said nothing; and I would beg of you to listen for a few moments to what he there has done. And although you are partisans of his, and hate us, yet, if you can, bear it with equanimity. For in his former epistle, to the first portion of which-the only portion which had then come into our hands-I had in the first instance made my reply, he had so rested the hope that is found in baptism in the baptizer, as to say, \"For everything consists of an origin and root; and if anything has not a head, it is nothing.\" Since then Petilianus had said this, not wishing anything to be understood by the origin and root and head of baptizing a man, except the man by whom he might be baptized, I made a comment, and said \"We ask, therefore, in a case where the faithlessness of the baptizer is undetected, if then the man whom he baptizes receives faith and not guilt? if then the baptizer is not his origin and root and head, who is it from whom he receives faith? where is the origin from which he springs? where is the root of which he is a shoot? where the head which is his starting-point? Can it be that, when he who is baptized is unaware of the faithlessness of his baptizer, it is then Christ who is the origin and root and head?\" This therefore I say and exclaim now also, as I did there as well: \"Alas for human rashness and conceit! Why do you not allow that it is always Christ who gives faith, for the purpose of making a man a Christian by giving it? Why do you not allow that Christ is always the origin of the Christian, that the Christian always plants his root in Christ, that Christ is the Head of the Christian? Will it then be urged that, even where spiritual grace is dispensed to those that believe by the hands of a holy and faithful minister, it is still not the minister himself who justifies, but that One of whom it is said, `He justifieth the ungodly'?[fn-57-P5758_2784241:90-nf] But unless we admit this, either the Apostle Paul was the head and origin of those whom he had planted, or Apollos the root of those whom he had watered, rather than He who had given them faith in briefing; whereas the same Paul says, `I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So that neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.'[fn-57-P5759_2784661:91-nf] Nor was the apostle himself their root, but rather He who says, `I am the vine, ye are the branches.'[fn-57-P5760_2784786:92-nf] How, too, could he be their head, when he says that `we, being many, are one body in Christ.'[fn-57-P5761_2784897:93-nf] and expressly declares in many passages that Christ Himself is the Head of the whole body? Wherefore, whether a man receives the sacrament of baptism from a faithful or a faithless minister his whole hope is in Christ, that he fall not under the condemnation, that `Cursed is he that placeth his hope in man!'\"[fn-57-P5762_2785226:94-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_62_book_iii_","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"168","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"59. Do not therefore any longer say, \"The conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,\" lest you be asked, When a stain on the conscience of the giver is concealed, who cleanses the conscience of the recipient? And when you shall have answered, Either God or an angel (since there is no other answer which you possibly can make), then should follow a consequence whereby you would be confounded: Those then are justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil men, so as to be cleansed by God or by an angel, than those who are baptized by men who are genuinely and manifestly good, who cannot be compared with God or with the angels. But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said by Truth and by the Catholic Church, that not only when the minister of baptism is evil, but also when he is holy and good, hope is still not to be placed in man, but in Him that justifieth the ungodly, in whom if any man believe, his faith is counted for righteousness.[fn-57-P5795_2802999:105-nf] For when we say, Christ baptizes, we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes, or would have men think that he believes, to be our meaning, but by a hidden grace, by a hidden power in the Holy Spirit as it is said of Him by John the Baptist, \"The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-57-P5796_2803331:106-nf] Nor has He, as Petilianus says, now ceased to baptize; but He still does it, not by any ministry of the body, but by the invisible working of His majesty. For in that we say, He Himself baptizes, we do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the water the bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses, and that He does to the whole Church without exception. Nor, indeed, may we refuse to believe the words of the Apostle Paul who says concerning Him, \"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.\"[fn-57-P5797_2803983:107-nf] Here you see that Christ sanctifies; here you see that Christ also Himself washes, Himself purifies with the self-same washing of water by the word, wherein the ministers are seen to do their work in the body. Let no one, therefore, claim unto himself what is of God.

But the passages which I have advanced to assert the truth of the Catholic Church,, are the following: As regards the question of baptism, that our being born again, cleansed, justified by the grace of God, should not be ascribed to the man who administered the sacrament, I quoted these: \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man:\"[fn-58-P5810_2808447:115-nf] and \"Cursed be every one that trusteth in man;\"[fn-58-P5811_2808517:116-nf] and that, \"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord;\"[fn-58-P5812_2808585:117-nf] and that, \"Vain is the help of man;\"[fn-58-P5813_2808641:118-nf] and that, \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase;\"[fn-58-P5814_2808770:119-nf] and that He in whom men believe justifieth the ungodly, that his faith may be counted to him for righteousness.[fn-58-P5815_2808904:120-nf] But in behalf of the unity of the Church itself, which is spread abroad throughout all the world, with which you do not hold communion, I urged that the following passages were prophesied of Christ: that \"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth;\"[fn-58-P5816_2809221:121-nf] and, \"I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession;\"[fn-58-P5817_2809359:122-nf] and that the covenant of God made with Abraham may be quoted in behalf of our, that is, of the Catholic communion, in which it is written, \"In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed;\"[fn-58-P5818_2809573:123-nf] which seed the apostle interprets, saying, \"And to thy seed, which is Christ.\"[fn-58-P5819_2809674:124-nf] Whence it is evident that in Christ not only Africans or Africa, but all the nations through which the Catholic Church is spread abroad, should receive the blessing which was promised so long before. And that the chaff is to be with the wheat even to the time of the last winnowing, that no one may excuse the sacrilege of his own separation from the Church by calumnious accusations of other men's offenses, if he shall have left or deserted the communion of all nations; and to show that the society of Christians may not be divided on account of evil ministers, that is, evil rulers in the Church, I further quoted the passage, \"All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works; for they say and do not.\"[fn-58-P5820_2810444:125-nf] With regard to these passages of holy Scripture which I advanced to prove my points, he neither showed how they ought to be otherwise interpreted, so as to prove that they neither made for us nor against you, nor was he willing to touch them in any way. Nay, his whole object was could it have been achieved, that by the tumultuous outpouring of his abuse, it might never occur to any one at all, who after reading my epistle might have been willing to read his as well, that these things had been said by me","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_62_book_iii_","source_chapter":54,"source_paragraph":"180","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"66. Finally, again, a little afterwards, when he resolved and was firmly purposed, as it were, to reconsider once more the words of the apostle which he had brought up against him, he was unwilling to set down this that I had said, preferring something else in which by some means or other the swelling of human pride might find means to breathe. \"For to reconsider,\" he says, \"those words of the apostle, on which you founded an argument against us; he said, `What is Apollos, what is Paul, save only ministers of Him in whom ye have believed?'[fn-58-P5837_2822968:130-nf] What else for example, does he say to all of us than this, What is Donatus of Carthage, what is Januarius, what is Petilianus, save only ministers of Him in whom ye have believed?\" I did not bring forward this passage of the apostle, but I did bring forward that which he has been unwilling to quote, \"Neither he that planteth is anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.\" But Petilianus was willing to insert those words of the apostle, in which he asks what is Paul, and what is Apollos, and answers that \"They are ministers of Him in whom ye have believed.\" This the muscles of the heretic's neck could bear; but he was wholly unable to endure the other, in which the apostle did not ask and answer what he was, but said that he was nothing. But now I am willing to ask whether it be true that the minister of Christ is nothing. Who will say so much as this? In what sense, therefore, is it true that \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase,\" except that he who is something in one point of view may be nothing in another? For ministering and dispensing the word and sacrament he is something, but for purifying and justifying he is nothing, seeing that this is not accomplished in the inner man, except by Him by whom the whole man was created, and who while He remained God was made man,-by Him, that is, of whom it was said, \"Purifying their hearts by faith;\"[fn-58-P5838_2824480:131-nf] and \"To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly.\"[fn-58-P5839_2824562:132-nf] And this testimony Petilianus has been willing to set forth in my words, whilst in his own he has neither handled it nor even touched it.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_63_a_treatise_concerning_the_correction_of_the_donatists","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"37. But if we consider what is said in the Book of Wisdom, \"Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly;\"[fn-60-P6005_2909564:70-nf] and also what is said in the Proverbs, \"The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just;\"[fn-60-P6006_2909673:71-nf] then we shall see that the question is not, who are in possession of the property of the heretics? but who are in the society of the just? We know, indeed, that the Donatists arrogate to themselves such a store of justice, that they boast not only that they possess it, but that they also below it upon other men. For they say that any one whom they have baptized is justified by them, after which there is nothing left for them but to say to the person who is baptized by them that he must needs believe on him who has administered the sacrament; for why should he not do so, when the apostle says, \"To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness?\"[fn-60-P6007_2910394:72-nf] Let him believe, therefore, upon the man by whom he is baptized, if it be none else that justifies him. that his faith may be counted for righteousness. But I think that even they themselves would look with horror on themselves, if they ventured for a moment to entertain such thoughts as these. For there is none that is just and able to justify, save God alone.

Behold, you have heard that when our Lord Jesus Christ \"was in Jerusalem at the Passover, on the feast day, many believed in His name, seeing the signs which He did.\" \"Many believed in His name;\" and what follows? \"But Jesus did not trust Himself to them.\" Now what does this mean, \"They believed,\" or trusted, \"in His name;\" and yet \"Jesus did not trust Himself to them;\"? Was it, perhaps, that they had not believed on Him, but were feigning to have believed, and that therefore Jesus did not trust Himself to them? But the evangelist would not have said, \"Many believed in His name,\" if he were not giving a true testimony to them. A great thing, then, it is, and a wonderful thing: men believe on Christ, and Christ trusts not Himself to men. Especially is it wonderful, since, being the Son of God, He of course suffered willingly. If He were not willing, He would never have suffered, since, had He not willed it, He had not been born; and if He had willed this only, merely to be born and not to die, He might have done evenwhatever He willed, because He is the almighty Son of the almighty Father Let us prove it by facts. For when they wished to hold Him, He departed from them. The Gospel says, \"And when they would have cast Him headlong from the top of the mountain, He departed from them unhurt.\"[fn-7-P700_337312:1-nf] And when they came to lay hold of Him, after He was sold by Judas the traitor, who imagined that he had it in his power to deliver up his Master and Lord, there also the Lord showed that He suffered of His own will, not of necessity. For when the Jews desired to lay hold of Him, He said to them, \"Whom seek ye? But they said, Jesus of Nazareth. And said He, I am He. On hearing this saying, they went backward, and fell to the ground.\"[fn-7-P701_337765:2-nf] In this, that in answering them He threw them to the ground, He showed His power; that in His being taken by them He might show His will. It was of compassion, then, that He suffered. For \"He was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-7-P702_338047:3-nf] Hear His own words: \"I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again: no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself, that I may take it again.\"[fn-7-P703_338236:4-nf] Since, therefore, He had such power, since He declared it by words, showed it by deeds, what then does it mean that Jesus did not trust Himself to them, as if they would do Him some harm against His will, or would do something to Him against His will, especially seeing that they had already believed in His name? Moreover, of the same persons the evangelist says, \"They believed in His name,\" of whom he says, \"But Jesus did not trust Himself to them.\" Why? \"Because He knew all men, and needed not that any should bear witness of man: for Himself knew what was in man.\" The artificer knew what was in His own work better than the work knew what was in itself. The Creator of man knew what was in man, which the created man himself knew not. Do we not prove this of Peter, that he knew not what was in himself, when he said, \"With Thee, even to death\"? Hear that the Lord knew what was in man: \"Thou with me even to death? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.\"[fn-7-P704_339258:5-nf] The man, then, knew not what was in himself; but the Creator of the man knew what was in the man. Nevertheless, many believed in His name, and yet Jesus did not trust Himself to them. What can we say, brethren? Perhaps the circumstances that follow will indicate to us what the mystery of these words is. That men had believed in Him is manifest, is true; none doubts it, the Gospel says it, the truth-speaking evangelist testifies to it. Again, that Jesus trusted not Himself to them is also manifest, and no Christian doubts it; for the Gospel says this also, and the same truth-speaking evangelist testifies to it. Why, then, is it that they believed in His name, and yet Jesus did not trust Himself to them? Let us see what follows.","title":"Tractate XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_24_the_second_homily","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Thus the holy Virgin, while still in the flesh, maintained the incorruptible life, and received in faith the things which were announced by the archangel.

This we read in the clear words of her who was barren; but yet more clearly did the holy Virgin herself express this again when she presented to God the song replete with thanksgiving, and acceptance, and divine knowledge; announcing ancient things together with what was new; proclaiming along with things which were of old, things also which belong to the consummation of the ages; and summing up in a short discourse the mysteries of Christ. \"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour,\" and so forth. \"He hath holpen His servant Israel in remembrance of His mercy, and of the covenant which He established with Abraham and with his seed for ever.\"[fn-12-P1223_315666:31-nf] Thou seest how the holy Virgin has surpassed even the perfection of the patriarchs, and how she confirms the covenant which was made with Abraham by God, when He said, \"This is the covenant which I shall establish between me and thee.\"[fn-12-P1224_315924:32-nf] Wherefore He has come and confirmed the covenant with Abraham, having received mystically in Himself the sign of circumcision, and having proved Himself the fulfilment of the law and the prophets.

For He has overthrown everywhere his altars and the worship of vain gods, and He has prepared for Himself a peculiar people out of the heathen nations. \"He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.\" In these terms is intimated in brief the extrusion of the Jews and the admission of the Gentiles. For the elders of the Jews and the scribes in the law, and those who were richly privileged with other prerogatives, because they used their riches ill and their power lawlessly, were cast down by Him from every seat, whether of prophecy or of priesthood, whether of legislature or of doctrine, and were stripped of all their ancestral wealth, and of their sacrifices and multitudinous festivals, and of all the honourable privileges of the kingdom.

For the Christ who was born of the Virgin, and who is our God, has given over the whole inheritance of divine blessings to the Gentiles. \"He hath holpen His servant Israel.\"[fn-12-P1229_318738:37-nf] Not any Israel in general, indeed, but His servant, who in very deed maintains the true nobility of Israel. And on this account also did the mother of God call Him servant (Son) and heir. For when He had found the same labouring painfully in the letter and the law, He called him by grace. It is such an Israel, therefore, that He called and hath holpen in remembrance of His mercy. \"As He spake to our fathers, I to Abraham and to his seed for ever.\" In these few words is comprehended the whole mystery of the economy. For, with the purpose of saving the race of men, and fulfilling the covenant that was made with our fathers, Christ has once \"bowed the heavens and come down.\"[fn-12-P1230_319436:38-nf] And thus He shows Himself to us as we are capable of receiving Him, in order that we might have power to see Him, and handle Him, and hear Him when the speaketh.

And after she had spoken these words the holy Virgin went to Nazareth; and from that a decree of Caesar led her to come again to Bethlehem; and so, as proceeding herself from the royal house, she was brought to the royal house of David along with Joseph her espoused husband. And there ensued there the mystery which transcends all wonders,-the Virgin brought forth and bore in her hand Him who bears the whole creation by His word. \"And there was no room for them in the inn.\"[fn-12-P1232_320479:40-nf] He found no room who founded the whole earth by His word. She nourished with her milk Him who imparts sustenance and life to everything that hath breath. She wrapped Him in swaddling-clothes who binds the whole creation fast with His word.

And the holy mother of God kept these words, and pondered them in her heart, like one who was the receptacle of all the mysteries. Thy praise, O most holy Virgin, surpasses all laudation, by reason of the God who received the flesh and was born man of thee. To thee every creature, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, offers the meet offering of honour. For thou hast been indeed set forth as the true cherubic throne. Thou shinest as the very brightness of light in the high places of the kingdoms of intelligence;[fn-12-P1234_321741:42-nf] where the Father, who is without beginning, and whose power thou hadst overshadowing thee, is glorified; where also the Son is worshipped, whom thou didst bear according to the flesh; and where the Holy Spirit is praised, who effected in thy womb the generation of the mighty King. Through thee, O thou that art highly favoured, is the holy and consubstantial Trinity known in the world. Together with thyself, deem us also worthy to be made partakers of thy perfect grace in Jesus Christ our Lord: with whom, and with the Holy Spirit, be glory to the Father, now and ever, and unto the ages of the ages.

Turn your thoughts now to what we said had to be deferred, that it may now, if possible, be opened. Concerning this very resurrection He immediately subjoined, \"For as the Father hath life in Himself, even so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself.\" What means that, \"The Father hath life in Himself\"? Not elsewhere hath He life but in Himself. His living, in fact, is in Him, not from elsewhere, nor derived from another. He does not, as it were, borrow life, nor, as it were, become a partaker of life, of a life which is not what Himself is: but \"hath life in Himself,\" so that the very life is to Him His very self. If I should be able yet further in some small measure to speak from this matter, by proposing examples for informing your understanding, will depend on God's help and the piety of your attention. God lives, and the soul also lives; but the life of God is unchangeable, the life of the soul is changeable. In God is neither increase nor decrease; but He is the same always in Himself, is ever as He is: not in one way now, in another way hereafter, in some other way before. But the life of the soul is exceedingly various: it lived foolish, it lives wise; it lived unrighteous, it lives righteous; now remembers, now forgets; now learns, now cannot learn; now loses what it had learned, now apprehends what it had lost. The life of the soul is changeable. And when the soul lives in unrighteousness, that is its death; when again it becomes righteous, it becomes partaker of another life, which is not what itself is, inasmuch as by rising up to God, and cleaving to God, of Him it is justified. For it is said, \"To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.\"[fn-10-P1012_593043:7-nf] By forsaking God, it becomes unrighteous; by coming to Him, it is made righteous. Does it not seem to thee as it were something cold, which, when brought near the fire, grows warm; when removed from the fire, grows cold? A something dark, which, brought near the light, grows bright; when removed from the light, grows dark? Something such is the soul: God is not any such thing. Moreover, man may say that he has light now in his eyes. Let thine eyes say then, if they can, as by a voice of their own, \"We have light in ourselves.\" I answer: Not correctly do you say that you have light in yourselves: you have light, but in the heavens; you have light, but in the moon, in candles, if it happen to be night, not in yourselves: for, being shut, you lose what you perceive when open. Not in yourselves have you light; keep the light if you can when the sun is set: 'tis night, enjoy the light of night; keep the light when the candle is withdrawn; but since you remain in darkness when the candle is withdrawn, you have not light in yourselves. Consequently, to have light in oneself is not to need light from another. Behold, whoso understands wherein He shows that the Son is equal with the Father, when He saith, \"As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son also to have life in Himself;\" that there may be only this difference between the Father and the Son, that the Father hath life in Himself, which none gave Him, whilst the Son hath life in Himself which the Father gave.","title":"Tractate XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_67_xvii_the_second_conference_of_abbot_joseph_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"123","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And therefore a monk ought not hastily to make any promise on those things which merely concern bodily exercise, for fear lest he may stir up the enemy still more to attack what he is keeping as it were under the observance of the law, and so he may be more readily compelled to break it.

They forgot not the lessons they had taught to others; yea, they know well that great dishonour remains for the traitors, but for them which confess the truth, the kingdom of heaven; and that to the careless and such as fear Constantius will happen no good thing; but for them that endure tribulations here, as sailors reach a quiet haven after a storm, as wrestlers receive a crown after the combat, so these shall obtain great and eternal joy and delight in heaven;-such as Joseph obtained after those tribulations; such as the great Daniel had after his temptations and the manifold conspiracies of the courtiers against him; such as Paul now enjoys, being crowned by the Saviour; such as the people of God everywhere expect.

For since it was a great and profound matter that had been spoken, the Lord Christ Himself did certainly see that all would not understand this so profound a matter, and He gave counsel in the sequel. Dost thou wish to understand? Believe. For God has said by the prophet: \"Except ye believe, ye shall not understand.\"[fn-13-P1391_878774:2-nf] To the same purpose what the Lord here also added as He went on\"If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak from myself.\" What is the meaning of this, \"If any man be willing to do His will\"? But I had said, if any man believe; and I gave this counsel: If thou hast not understood, said I, believe. For understanding is the reward of faith. Therefore do not seek to understand in order to believe, but believe that thou mayest understand; since, \"except ye believe, ye shall not understand.\" Therefore when I would counsel the obedience of believing toward the possibility of understanding, and say that our Lord Jesus Christ has added this very thing in the following sentence, we find Him to have said, \"If any man be willing to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.\" What is \"he shall know\"? It is the same thing as \"he shall understand.\" But what is \"If any man be willing to do His will\"? It is the same thing as to believe. All men indeed perceive that \"shall know\" is the same thing as \"shall understand:\" but that the saying, \"If any man be willing to do His will,\" refers to believing, all do not perceive; to perceive this more accurately, we need the Lord Himself for expounder, to show us whether the doing of the Father's will does in reality refer to believing. But who does not know that this is to do the will of God, to work the work of God; that is, to work that work which is pleasing to Him? But the Lord Himself says openly in another place: \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He has sent.\"[fn-13-P1392_880401:3-nf] \"That ye believe on Him,\" not, that ye believe Him.

Again, moreover, of His apostles we can say, we believe Paul; but not, we believe on Paul: we believe Peter; but not, we believe on Peter. For, \"to him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted unto him for righteousness.\"[fn-13-P1393_880893:4-nf] What then is \"to believe on Him\"? By believing to love Him, by believing to esteem highly, by believing to go into Him and to be incorporated in His members. It is faith itself then that God exacts from us: and He finds not that which He exacts, unless He has bestowed what He may find. What faith, but that which the apostle has most amply defined in another place, saying, \"Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by love?\"[fn-13-P1394_881377:5-nf] Not any faith of what kind soever, but \"faith that worketh by love:\" let this faith be in thee, and thou shall understand concerning the doctrine.

To give a witness then, and for our sakes to undergo death, to raise man up and destroy the works of the devil[fn-62-P6234_2486989:357-nf] , the Saviour came, and this is the reason of His incarnate presence. For otherwise a resurrection had not been, unless there had been death; and how had death been, unless He had had a mortal body? This the Apostle, learning from Him, thus sets forth, `Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage[fn-62-P6235_2488699:358-nf] .' And, `Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-62-P6236_2488812:359-nf] .' And again, `For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the ordinance of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit[fn-62-P6237_2489124:360-nf] .' And John says, `For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved[fn-62-P6238_2489286:361-nf] .' And again, the Saviour has spoken in His own person, `For judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not might see, and that they which see might become blind[fn-62-P6239_2489480:362-nf] .' Not for Himself then, but for our salvation, and to abolish death, and to condemn sin, and to give sight to the blind, and to raise up all from the dead, has He come; but if not for Himself, but for us, by consequence not for Himself but for us is He created. But if not for Himself is He created, but for us, then He is not Himself a creature, but, as having put on our flesh, He uses such language. And that this is the sense of the Scriptures, we may learn from the Apostle, who says in Ephesians, `Having broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, to create in Himself of twain one new man, so making peace[fn-62-P6240_2490219:363-nf] .'

To give a witness then, and for our sakes to undergo death, to raise man up and destroy the works of the devil[fn-62-P6234_2486989:357-nf] , the Saviour came, and this is the reason of His incarnate presence. For otherwise a resurrection had not been, unless there had been death; and how had death been, unless He had had a mortal body? This the Apostle, learning from Him, thus sets forth, `Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage[fn-62-P6235_2488699:358-nf] .' And, `Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-62-P6236_2488812:359-nf] .' And again, `For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the ordinance of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit[fn-62-P6237_2489124:360-nf] .' And John says, `For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved[fn-62-P6238_2489286:361-nf] .' And again, the Saviour has spoken in His own person, `For judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not might see, and that they which see might become blind[fn-62-P6239_2489480:362-nf] .' Not for Himself then, but for our salvation, and to abolish death, and to condemn sin, and to give sight to the blind, and to raise up all from the dead, has He come; but if not for Himself, but for us, by consequence not for Himself but for us is He created. But if not for Himself is He created, but for us, then He is not Himself a creature, but, as having put on our flesh, He uses such language. And that this is the sense of the Scriptures, we may learn from the Apostle, who says in Ephesians, `Having broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, to create in Himself of twain one new man, so making peace[fn-62-P6240_2490219:363-nf] .'

For faith in Christ is to believe in Him that justifieth the ungodly;[fn-23-P2331_1418126:19-nf] to believe in the Mediator, without whose interposition we cannot be reconciled unto God; to believe in the Saviour, who came to seek and to save that which was lost;[fn-23-P2332_1418310:20-nf] to believe in Him who said, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\"[fn-23-P2333_1418389:21-nf] Because, then, being ignorant of that righteousness of God that justifieth the ungodly, he wishes to set up his own to satisfy the minds of the proud, such a man cannot believe on Christ.

And, accordingly, after saying, \"He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,\" that it might not be thought that He would have the Father so understood, as if He were the Father only of many sons regenerated by grace, and not of the only-begotten Word, His own co-equal, He immediately added, \"And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent me.\" Does He say here, He that seeth me, seeth not me, but Him that sent me, as He had said, \"He that believeth me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me\"? For He uttered the former of these words, that He might not be believed on merely as He then appeared, that is, as the Son of man; and the latter, that He might be believed on as the equal of the Father. He that believeth on me, believeth not merely on what He sees of me, but believeth on Him that sent me. Or, when he believeth on the Father, who begat me, His own co-equal, let him believe on me, not as he seeth me, but as [he believeth] on Him that sent me; for so far does the truth, that there is no distance between Him and me, reach, that He who seeth me, seeth Him that sent me. Certainly, Christ the Lord Himself sent His apostles, as their name implies: for as those who in Greek are called angeli are in Latin called nuntii [messengers], so the Greek apostoli [apostles] becomes the Latin missi [persons sent]. But never would any of the apostles have dared to say, \"He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me;\" for in no sense whatever would he say, \"He that believeth on me.\" We believe an apostle, but we do not believe on him; for it is not an apostle that justifieth the ungodly.

The five porches in which the infirm folk lay signify the Law, which was first given to the Jews and to the people of Israel by Moses the servant of God. For this Moses the minister of the Law wrote five books. In relation therefore to the number of the books which he wrote, the five porches figured the Law. But because the Law was not given to heal the infirm, but to discover and to manifest them; for so saith the Apostle, \"For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the Law; But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe;\"[fn-59-P5945_2516913:2-nf] therefore in those porches the sick folk lay, but were not cured. For what saith he? \"If there had been a law given which could have given life.\" Therefore those porches which figured the Law could not cure the sick. Some one will say to me, \"Why then was it given?\" The Apostle Paul hath himself explained: \"Scripture,\" saith he, \"hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\" For these folk who were sick, thought themselves to be whole. They received the Law, which they were not able to fulfil; they learnt in what disease they were, and they implored the Physician's aid; they wished to be cured because they came to know they were in distress, which they would not have known if they had not been unable to fulfil the Law which had been given. For man thought himself innocent, and from this very pride of false innocence became more mad. To tame this pride then and to lay it bare, the Law was given; not to deliver the sick, but to convince the proud. Attend then, Beloved; to this end was the Law given, to discover diseases, not to take them away. And so then those sick folk who might have been sick in their own houses with greater privacy, if those five porches had not existed, were in those porches set forth to the eyes of all men, but were not by the porches cured. The Law therefore was useful to discover sins, because that man being made more abundantly guilty by the transgression of the Law, might, having tamed his pride, implore the help of Him That pitieth. Attend to the Apostle; \"The Law entered that sin might abound; but where sin abounded, grace hath much more abounded.\"[fn-59-P5946_2518600:3-nf] What is, \"The Law entered that sin might abound \"? As in another place he saith, \"For where there is no law, there is no transgression.\"[fn-59-P5947_2518752:4-nf] Man may be called a sinner before the Law, a transgressor he cannot. But when he hath sinned, after that he hath received the Law, he is found not only a sinner, but a transgressor. Forasmuch then as to sin is added transgression, therefore \"hath sin abounded.\" And when sin abounds, human pride learns at length to submit itself, and to confess to God, and to say \"I am weak\" To say to those words of the Psalm which none but the humbled soul saith, \"I said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.\"[fn-59-P5948_2519302:5-nf] Let the weak soul then say this that is at least convinced by transgression, and not cured, but manifested by the Law. Hear too Paul himself showing thee, both that the Law is good, and yet that nothing but the grace of Christ delivereth from sin. For the Law can prohibit and command; apply the medicine, that that which doth not allow a man to fulfil the Law, may be cured, it cannot, but grace only doeth that. For the Apostle saith, \"For I delight in the Law of Godafter the inner man.\"[fn-59-P5949_2519808:6-nf] That is, I see now that what the Law blames is evil, and what the Law commands is good. \"For I delight in the Law of God after the inner man. I see another law in my members resisting the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity in the law of sin.\" This derived from the punishment of sin, from the propagation of death, from the condemnation of Adam, \"resists the law of the mind, and brings it into captivity in the law of sin which is in the members.\" He was convinced; he received the Law, that he might be convinced: see now what profit it was to him that he was convinced.

The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-59-P5950_2520561:7-nf] ","title":"Sermon LXXV. [CXXV.

But still, possessed as Judas now was, not by the Lord, but by the devil, and now that the bread had entered the belly, and an enemy the soul of this man of ingratitude: still, I say, there was this enormous wickedness, already conceived in his heart, waiting to be wrought out to its full issue, for which the damnable desire had always preceded. Accordingly, when the Lord, the living Bread, had given this bread to the dead, and in giving it had revealed the betrayer of the Bread, He said, \"What thou doest, do quickly.\" He did not command the crime, but foretold evil to Judas, and good to us.

He got the wages he wished, but had also given him, against his wish, the wages he merited.

I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question. May it be well with you, incomparable and honourable father!","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?

The Saviour, in thus speaking to the disciples, commends still more and more the grace whereby we are saved, when He says, \"Herein is my Father glorified,[fn-29-P2901_1665981:1-nf] that ye bear very much fruit, and be made my disciples.\" Whether we say glorified, or made bright, both are the rendering given us of one Greek verb, namely doxazein (docazein). For what is doxa (doca) in Greek, is in Latin glory. I have thought it worth while to mention this, because the apostle says, \"If Abraham was justified by works, he hath glory. but not before God.\"[fn-29-P2902_1666472:2-nf] For this is the glory before God, whereby God, and not man, is glorified, when he is justified, not by works, but by faith, so that even his doing well is imparted to him by God; just as the branch, as I have stated above,[fn-29-P2903_1666711:3-nf] cannot bear fruit of itself. For if herein God the Father is glorified, that we bear much fruit, and be made the disciples of Christ, let us not credit our own glory therewith, as if we had it of ourselves. For of Him is such a grace, and accordingly therein the glory is not ours, but His. Hence also, in another passage, after saying, \"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works;\" to keep them from the thought that such good works were of themselves, He immediately added, \"and may glorify your Father who is in heaven.\"[fn-29-P2904_1667286:4-nf] For herein is the Father glorified, that we bear much fruit, and be made the disciples of Christ.
