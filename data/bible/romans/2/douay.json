{"verses":["Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that\njudgest.  For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself.  For\nthou dost the same things which thou judgest.","For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth,\nagainst them that do such things.","And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such\nthings and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?","Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and patience and\nlongsuffering?  Knowest thou not that the benignity of God leadeth thee\nto penance?","But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou\ntreasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath and revelation\nof the just judgment of God:","Who will render to every man according to his works.","To them indeed who, according to patience in good work, seek glory\nand honour and incorruption, eternal life:","But to them that are contentious and who obey not the truth but\ngive credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.","Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil:\nof the Jew first, and also of the Greek.","But glory and honour and peace to every one that worketh good:  to\nthe Jew first, and also to the Greek.","For there is no respect of persons with God.","For whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without\nthe law:  and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the\nlaw.","For not the hearers of the law are just before God:  but the doers\nof the law shall be justified.","For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those\nthings that are of the law; these, having not the law, are a law to\nthemselves.","Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their\nconscience bearing witness to them:  and their thoughts between\nthemselves accusing or also defending one another,","In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus\nChrist, according to my gospel.","But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law and makest\nthy boast of God,","And knowest his will and approvest the more profitable things,\nbeing instructed by the law:","Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light\nof them that are in darkness,","An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the\nform of knowledge and of truth in the law.","Thou therefore, that teachest another, teachest not thyself:\nthou, that preachest that men should not steal, stealest.","Thou, that sayest men should not commit adultery, committest\nadultery:  thou, that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:","Thou, that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the\nlaw dishonourest God.","(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the\nGentiles, as it is written.)","Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law:  but if thou\nbe a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.","If then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall\nnot this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?","And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it\nfulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a\ntransgressor of the law?","For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly:  nor is that\ncircumcision which is outwardly in the flesh.","But he is a Jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that\nof the heart, in the spirit not in the letter:  whose praise is not of\nmen, but of God."]}
