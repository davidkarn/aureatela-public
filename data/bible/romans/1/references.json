And on this account assuredly the happiness of the ancient ages was changed.

Superstitions of this kind, therefore, were followed by injustice and impiety, as must necessarily be the case. For men ceased to raise their countenances to the heaven; but, their minds being depressed downwards, clung to goods of the earth, as they did to earth-born superstitions.There followed the disagreement of mankind, and fraud, and all wickedness; because, despising eternal and incorruptible goods, which alone ought to be desired by man, they rather chose temporal and short-lived things, and greater trust was placed by men in evil, inasmuch as they preferred vice to virtue, because it had presented itself as nearer at hand.[fn-11-P1120_502647:3-nf] ","title":"Book IV.

Similar evidence has been collected also concerning the Holy Spirit, of which those who have discussed the subject before ourselves have most fully availed themselves, that He too is God, and not a creature. But if not a creature, then not only God (for men likewise are called gods[fn-2-P238_83452:44-nf] ), but also very God; and therefore absolutely equal with the Father and the Son, and in the unity of the Trinity consubstantial and co-eternal. But that the Holy Spirit is not a creature is made quite plain by that passage above all others, where we are commanded not to serve the creature, but the Creator;[fn-2-P239_83782:45-nf] not in the sense in which we are commanded to \"serve\" one another by love,[fn-2-P240_83874:46-nf] which is in Greek douleuein, but in that in which God alone is served, which is in Greek latreuein. From whence they are called idolaters who tender that service to images which is due to God. For it is this service concerning which it is said, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-2-P241_84207:47-nf] For this is found also more distinctly in the Greek Scriptures, which have latreuseij. Now if we are forbidden to serve the creature with such a service, seeing that it is written, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve\" (and hence, too, the apostle repudiates those who worship and serve the creature more than the Creator), then assuredly the Holy Spirit is not a creature, to whom such a service is paid by all the saints; as says the apostle, \"For we are the circumcision, which serve the Spirit of God,\"[fn-2-P242_84764:48-nf] which is in the Greek latreuontej. For even most Latin copies also have it thus, \"We who serve the Spirit of God;\" but all Greek ones, or almost all, have it so. Although in some Latin copies we find, not \"We worship the Spirit of God,\" but, \"We worship God in the Spirit.\" But let those who err in this case, and refuse to give up to the more weighty authority, tell us whether they find this text also varied in the mss.: \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\" Yet what can be more senseless or more profane, than that any one should dare to say that the members of Christ are the temple of one who, in their opinion, is a creature inferior to Christ? For the apostle says in another place, \"Your bodies are members of Christ.\" But if the members of Christ are also the temple of the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit is not a creature; because we must needs owe to Him, of whom our body is the temple, that service wherewith God only is to be served, which in Greek is called latreia.

For many heretics, deceiving souls under the Christian name, endure many such things; but they are excluded from that reward on this account, that it is not said merely, \"Blessed are they which endure persecution;\" but it is added,\" for righteousness' sake.\" Now, where there is no sound faith, there can be no righteousness, for the just [righteous] man lives by faith.[fn-2-P278_57515:39-nf] Neither let schismatics promise themselves anything of that reward; for similarly, where there is no love, there cannot be righteousness, for \"love worketh no ill to his neighbour;\"[fn-2-P279_57730:40-nf] and if they had it, they would not tear in pieces Christ's body, which is the Church.[fn-2-P280_57836:41-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_07_book_i_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"51. \"Again,\" says He, \"ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath:[fn-4-P454_142618:153-nf] But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more[fn-4-P455_143027:154-nf] than these cometh of evil.\" The righteousness of the Pharisees is not to forswear oneself; and this is confirmed by Him who gives the command not to swear, so far as relates to the righteousness of the kingdom of heaven. For just as he who does not speak at all cannot speak falsely, so he who does not swear at all cannot swear falsely. But yet, since he who takes God to witness swears, this section must be carefully considered, lest the apostle should seem to have acted contrary to the Lord's precept, who often swore in this way, when he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not;\"[fn-4-P456_143686:155-nf] and again, \"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.\"[fn-4-P457_143818:156-nf] Of like nature also is that asseveration, \"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.\"[fn-4-P458_144026:157-nf] Unless, perchance, one were to say that it is to be reckoned swearing only when something is spoken of by which one swears; so that he has not used an oath, because he has not said, by God; but has said, \"God is witness.\" It is ridiculous to think so; yet because of the contentious, or those very slow of apprehension, lest any one should think there is a difference, let him know that the apostle has used an oath in this way also, saying, \"By your rejoicing, I die daily.\"[fn-4-P459_144520:158-nf] And let no one think that this is so expressed as if it were said, Your rejoicing makes me die daily; just as it is said, By his teaching he became learned, i.e. by his teaching it came about that he was perfectly instructed:the Greek copies decide the matter, where we find it written, Nh thn kauxhsin umeteran, an expression which is used only by one taking an oath. Thus, then, it is understood that the Lordgave the command not to swear in this sense, lest any one should eagerly seek after an oath as a good thing, and by the constant use of oaths sink down through force of habit into perjury. And therefore let him who understands that swearing is to be reckoned not among things that are good, but among things that are necessary, refrain as far as he can from indulgingin it, unless by necessity, when he sees men slow to believe what it is useful for them to believe,except they be assured by an oath. To this, accordingly, reference is made when it is said, \"Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay;\" this is good, and what is to be desired. \"For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil;\" i.e., if you are compelled to swear, know that it comes of a necessity arising from the infirmity of those whom you are trying to persuade of something; which infirmity is certainly an evil, from which we daily pray to be delivered, when we say, \"Deliver us from evil.\"[fn-4-P460_145916:159-nf] Hence He has not said, Whatsoever is more than these is evil; for you are not doing what is evil when you make a good use of an oath, which, although not in itself good, is yet necessary in order to persuade another that you are trying to move him for some useful end; but it \"cometh of evil\" on his part by whose infirmity you are compelled to swear.[fn-4-P461_146289:160-nf] But no one learns, unless he has had experience, how difficult it is both to get rid of a habit of swearing, and never to do rashly what necessity sometimes compels him to do.[fn-4-P462_146701:161-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"25. But now of the clouds, and voices, and lightnings, and the trumpet, and the smoke on Mount Sinai, when it was said, \"And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire, and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and all the people that was in the camp trembled; and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\"[fn-5-P580_215091:89-nf] And a little after, when the Law had been given in the ten commandments, it follows in the text, \"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking.\" And a little after, \"And [when the people saw it,] they removed and stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness[fn-5-P581_215456:90-nf] where God was, and the Lord said unto Moses,\"[fn-5-P582_215517:91-nf] etc. What shall I say about this, save that no one can be so insane as to believe the smoke, and the fire, and the cloud, and the darkness, and whatever there was of the kind, to be the substance of the word and wisdom of God which is Christ, or of the Holy Spirit? For not even the Arians ever dared to say that they were the substance of God the Father. All these things, then, were wrought through the creature serving the Creator, and were presented in a suitable economy (dispensatio) to human senses; unless, perhaps, because it is said,\"And Moses drew near to the cloud where God was,\" carnal thoughts must needs suppose that the cloud was indeed seen by the people, but that within the cloud Moses with the eyes of the flesh saw the Son of God, whom doting heretics will have to be seen in His own substance. Forsooth, Moses may have seen Him with the eyes of the flesh, if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ, but even that of any man you please and howsoever wise, can be seen with the eyes of the flesh; or if, because it is written of the elders of Israel, that \"they saw the place where the God of Israel had stood,\" and that \"there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness,\"[fn-5-P583_216807:92-nf] therefore we are to believe that the word and wisdom of God in His own substance stood within the space of an earthly place, who indeed \"reacheth firmly from end to end, and sweetly ordereth all things;\"[fn-5-P584_217030:93-nf] and that the Word of God, by whom all things were made,[fn-5-P585_217106:94-nf] is in such wise changeable, as now to contract, now to expand Himself; (may the Lord cleanse the hearts of His faithful ones from such thoughts!) But indeed all these visible and sensible things are, as we have often said, exhibited through the creature made subject in order to signify the invisible and intelligible God, not only the Father, but also the Son and the Holy Spirit,\" of whom are all things, and through whom are all things, and in whom are all things;\"[fn-5-P586_217591:95-nf] although \"the invisible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead.\"[fn-5-P587_217784:96-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_07_tractate_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. But truly there have been some philosophers of this world who have sought for the Creator by means of the creature; for He can be found by means of the creature, as the apostle plainly says, \"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and glory; so they are without excuse.\" And it follows, \"Because that, when they knew God;\" he did not say, Because they did not know, but \"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\" How darkened? It follows, when he says more plainly: \"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools\"[fn-2-P261_43047:2-nf] They saw whither they must come; but ungrateful to Him who afforded them what they saw, they wished to ascribe to themselves what they saw; and having become proud, they lost what they saw, and were turned from it to idols and images, and to the worship of demons, to adore the creature and to despise the Creator. But these having been blinded did those things, and became proud, that they might be blinded: when they were proud they said that they were wise. Those, therefore, concerning whom he said, \"Who, when they had known God,\" saw this which John says, that by the Word of God all things were made. For these things are also found in the books of the philosophers: and that God has an only-begotten Son, by whom are all things. They were able to see that which is, but they saw it from afar: they were unwilling to hold the lowliness of Christ, in which ship they might have arrived in safety at that which they were able to see from afar and the cross of Christ appeared vile to them. The sea has to be crossed, and dost thou despise the wood? Oh, proud wisdom! thou laughest to scorn the crucified Christ; it is He whom thou dost see from afar: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.\" But wherefore was He crucified? Because the wood of His humiliation was needful to thee. For thou hadst become swollen with pride, and hadst been cast out far from that fatherland; and by the waves of this world has the way been intercepted, and there is no means of passing to the fatherland unless borne by the wood Ungrateful one! thou laughest Him to scorn who has come to thee that thou mayest return: He has become the way, and that through the sea:[fn-2-P262_44738:3-nf] thence He walked in the sea to show that there is a way in the sea. But thou who art not able in any way thyself to walk in the sea, be carried in a ship, be carried by the wood: believe in the crucified One, and thou shalt arrive thither. On account of thee He was crucified, to teach thee humility; and because if He should come as God, He would not be recognized. For if He should come as God, He would not come to those who were not able to see God. For not according to His Godhead does He either come or depart; since He is everywhere present, and is contained in no place. But, according to what did He come? He appeared as a man.","title":"Tractate II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"277","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1.

So overpowered am I by the sad intelligence of the falling asleep of the holy and by me deeply revered Lucinius that I am scarcely able to dictate even a short letter. I do not, it is true, lament his fate, for I know that he has passed to better things: like Moses he can say: \"I will now turn aside and see this great sight.\"[fn-31-P3134_819754:2268-nf] but I am tormented with regret that I was not allowed to look upon the face of one, who was likely, as I believed, in a short time to come hither. True indeed is the prophetic warning concerning the doom of death that it divides brothers,[fn-31-P3135_820016:2269-nf] and with harsh and cruel hand sunders those whose names are linked together in the bonds of love. But we have this consolation that it is slain by the word of the Lord. For it is said: \"O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction,\" and in the next verse: \"An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.\"[fn-31-P3136_820533:2270-nf] For, as Isaiah says, \"there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots\":[fn-31-P3137_820692:2271-nf] and He says Himself in the Song of Songs, \"I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley.\"[fn-31-P3138_820815:2272-nf] Our rose is the destruction of death, and died that death itself might die in His dying. But, when it is said that He is to be brought \"from the wilderness,\" the virgin's womb is indicated, which without sexual intercourse or impregnation has given to us God in the form of an infant able to quench by the glow of the Holy Spirit the fountains of lust and to sing in the words of the psalm: \"as in a dry and pathless and waterless land, so have I appeared unto thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-31-P3139_821322:2273-nf] Thus when we have to face the hard and cruel necessity of death, we are upheld by this consolation, that we shall shortly see again those whose absence we now mourn. For their end is not called death but a slumber and a falling asleep. Wherefore also the blessed apostle forbids us to sorrow concerning them which are asleep,[fn-31-P3140_821680:2274-nf] telling us to believe that those whom we know to sleep now may hereafter be roused from their sleep, and when their slumber is ended may watch once more with the saints and sing with the angels:-\"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among men of good will.\"[fn-31-P3141_821974:2275-nf] In heaven where there is no sin, there is glory and perpetual praise and unwearied singing; but on earth where sedition reigns, and war and discord hold sway, peace must be gained by prayer, and it is to be found not among all but only among men of good will, who pay heed to the apostolic salutation: \"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-31-P3142_822376:2276-nf] For \"His abode is in peace and His dwelling place is in Zion,\"[fn-31-P3143_822459:2277-nf] that is, on a watch-tower,[fn-31-P3144_822552:2278-nf] on a height of doctrines and of virtues, in the soul of the believer; for the angel of this latter daily beholds the face of God,[fn-31-P3145_822750:2279-nf] and contemplates with unveiled face the glory of God.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"974","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Let us not imitate the faults of one whose virtues we cannot equal.

Unhappy wretch! to be wept over by all Christian men, who sees not that in speaking thus he makes himself one with the Samaritans and the Jews who hold dead bodies unclean and regard as defiled even vessels which have been in the same house with them, following the letter that killeth and not the spirit that giveth life.[fn-42-P4200_1133030:3017-nf] We, it is true, refuse to worship or adore, I say not the relics of the martyrs, but even the sun and moon, the angels and archangels, the Cherubim and Seraphim and \"every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come.\"[fn-42-P4201_1133302:3018-nf] For we may not serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.[fn-42-P4202_1133407:3019-nf] Still we honour the relics of the martyrs, that we may adore Him whose martyrs they are.

I think, therefore, that I ought to warn you, in all kindness and affection, to hold fast the faith of the saintly Innocent, the spiritual son of Anastasius and his successor in the apostolic see; and not to receive any foreign doctrine, however wise and discerning you may take yourself to be. Men of this type whisper in corners and pretend to inquire into the justice of God. Why, they ask, was a particular soul born in a particular province?

For thus, they say, it was signified that the nation dedicated to Mars,-that is, the Roman,-should yield to none the place it once occupied; likewise, that on account of the god Terminus, no one would be able to disturb the Roman frontiers; and also, that the Roman youth, because of the goddess Juventas, should yield to no one. Let them see, therefore, how they can hold him to be the king of their god's, and the giver of their own kingdom, if these auguries set him down for an adversary, to whom it would have been honorable not to yield. However, if these things are true, they need not be at all afraid. For they are not going to confess that the gods who would not yield to Jove have yielded to Christ. For, without altering the boundaries of the empire, Jesus Christ has proved Himself able to drive them, not only from their temples, but from the hears of their worshippers. But, before Christ came in the flesh, and, indeed, before these things which we have quoted from their books could have been written, but yet after that auspice was made under king Tarquin, the Roman army has been divers times scattered or put to flight, and has shown the falseness of the auspice, which they derived from the fact that the goddess Juventas had not given place to Jove; and the nation dedicated to Mars was trodden down in the city itself by the invading and triumphant Gauls; and the boundaries of the empire, through the falling away of many cities to Hannibal, had been hemmed into a narrow space. Thus the beauty of the auspices is made void, and there has remained only the contumacy against Jove, not of gods, but of demons. For it is one thing not to have yielded, and another to have returned whither you have yielded. Besides, even afterwards, in the oriental regions, the boundaries of the Roman empire were changed by the will of Hadrian; for he yielded up to the Persian empire those three noble provinces, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria. Thus that god Terminus, who according to these books was the guardian of the Roman frontiers, and by that most beautiful auspice had not given place to Jove, would seem to have been more afraid of Hadrian, a king of men, than of the king of the gods. The aforesaid provinces having also been taken back again, almost within our own recollection the frontier fell back, when Julian, given up to the oracles of their gods, with immoderate daring ordered the victualling ships to be set on fire. The army being thus left destitute of provisions, and he himself also being presently killed by the enemy, and the legions being hard pressed, while dismayed by the loss of their commander, they were reduced to such extremities that no one could have escaped, unless by articles of peace the boundaries of the empire had then been established where they still remain; not, indeed, with so great a loss as was suffered by the concession of Hadrian, but still at a considerable sacrifice. It was a vain augury, then, that the god Terminus did not yield to Jove, since he yielded to the will of Hadrian, and yielded also to the rashness of Julian, and the necessity of Jovinian. The more intelligent and grave Romans have seen these things, but have had little power against the custom of the state, which was bound to observe the rites of the demons; because even they themselves, although they perceived that these things were vain, yet thought that the religious worship which is due to God should be paid to the nature of things which is established under the rule and government of the one true God, \"serving,\" as saith the apostle, \"the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for evermore.\"[fn-8-P825_421390:22-nf] The help of this true God was necessary to send holy and truly pious men, who would die for the true religion that they might remove the false from among the living.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_06_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"126","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"17 Thus far Africanus.

But for our present need we must discuss, so far as God gives us power, in what manner the single of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ answers to, and is, so to say, in harmony with our double to the effect of salvation. We certainly, as no Christian doubts, are dead both in soul and body: in soul, because of sin; in body, because of the punishment of sin, and through this also in body because of sin. And to both these parts of ourselves, that is, both to soul and to body, there was need both of a medicine and of resurrection, that what had been changed for the worse might be renewed for the better. Now the death of the soul is ungodliness, and the death of the body is corruptibility, through which comes also a departure of the soul from the body. For as the soul dies when God leaves it, so the body dies when the soul leaves it; whereby the former becomes foolish, the latter lifeless. For the soul is raised up again by repentance, and the renewing of life is begun in the body still mortal by faith, by which men believe on Him who justities the ungodly;[fn-8-P828_322114:13-nf] and it is increased and strengthened by good habits from day to day, as the inner man is renewed more and more.[fn-8-P829_322243:14-nf] But the body, being as it were the outward man, the longer this life lasts is so much the more corrupted, either by age or by disease, or by various afflictions, until it come to that last affliction which all call death. And its resurrection is delayed until the end; when also our justification itself shall be perfected ineffably. For then we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.[fn-8-P830_322659:15-nf] But now, so long as the corruptible body presseth down the soul,[fn-8-P831_322744:16-nf] and human life upon earth is all temptation,[fn-8-P832_322807:17-nf] in His sight shall no man living be justified,[fn-8-P833_322872:18-nf] in comparison of the righteousness in which we shall be made equal with the angels, and of the glory which shall be revealed in us. But why mention more proofs respecting the difference between the death of the soul and the death of the body, when the Lord in one sentence of the Gospel has made either death easily distinguishable by any one from the other, where He says, \"Let the dead bury their dead\"?[fn-8-P834_323298:19-nf] For burial was the fitting disposal of a dead body. But by those who were to bury it He meant those who were dead in soul by the impiety of unbelief, such, namely, as are awakened when it is said, \"Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.\"[fn-8-P835_323603:20-nf] And there is a death which the apostle denounces, saying of the widow, \"But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-8-P836_323751:21-nf] Therefore the soul, which was before ungodly and is now godly, is said to have come alive again from the dead and to live, on account of the righteousness of faith. But the body is not only said to be about to die, on account of that departure of the soul which will be; but on account of the great infirmity of flesh and blood it is even said to be now dead, in a certain place in the Scriptures, namely, where the apostle says, that \"the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.\"[fn-8-P837_324288:22-nf] Now this life is wrought by faith, \"since the just shall live by faith,\"[fn-8-P838_324380:23-nf] But what follows? \"But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit which dwelleth in you.\"[fn-8-P839_324605:24-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"21.

When therefore we regard the Creator, who is understood by the things that are made[fn-11-P1161_481624:23-nf] we must needs understand the Trinity of whom there appear traces in the creature, as is fitting.

Those three, therefore, both seem to be mutually determined to each other, and are in themselves infinite. But here in corporeal things, one thing alone is not as much as three together, and two are something more than one; but in that highest Trinity one is as much as the three together, nor are two anything more than one.

And I say this not to demonstrate that so much is due to the Spirit in the ascription of glory, but to prove the unfairness of those who will not ever give so much as this, and shrink from the fellowship of the Spirit with Son and Father as from impiety. Who could touch on these things without a sigh?[fn-18-P1898_508383:596-nf] Is it not so plain as to be within the perception even of a child that this presentstate of things preludes the threatened eclipseof the faith? The undeniable has become the uncertain. We profess belief in the Spirit, and then we quarrel with our own confessions. We are baptized, and begin to fight again. We call upon Him as the Prince of Life, and then despise Him as a slave like ourselves. We received Him with the Father and the Son, and we dishonour Him as a part of creation.

I am sure that we shall do the truth a wrong if we refuse to number that soul with the people of God, shining as it did like a beacon in the Church of God; for by the fellow-working of the Spirit the power which he had over demons was tremendous, and so gifted was he with the grace of the word \"for obedience to the faith among ...the nations,\"[fn-19-P1932_523430:623-nf] that, although only seventeen Christians were handed over to him, hebrought the whole people alike in town and country through knowledge to God. He too by Christ's mighty name commanded even rivers to change their course,[fn-19-P1933_524056:624-nf] and caused a lake, which afforded a ground of quarrel to some covetous brethren, to dry up.[fn-19-P1934_524171:625-nf] Moreover his predictions of things to come were such as in no wise to fall short of those of the great prophets. To recount all his wonderful works in detail would be too long a task. By the superabundance of gifts, wrought in him by the Spirit in all power and in signs and in marvels, he was styled a second Moses by the very enemies of the Church. Thus in all that he through grace accomplished, alike byword and deed, a light seemed ever to be shining, token of the heavenly power from the unseen which followed him. To this day he is a great object of admiration to the people of his own neighbourhood, and his memory, established in the churches ever fresh and green, is not dulled by length of time. Thus not a practice, not a word, not a mystic rite has been added to the Church besides what he bequeathed to it. Hence truly on account of the antiquity of their institution many of their ceremonies appear to be defective.[fn-19-P1935_525120:626-nf] For his successors in the administration of the Churches could not endure to accept any subsequent discovery in addition to what had had his sanction. Now one of the institutions of Gregory is the very form of the doxology to which objection is now made, preserved by the Church on the authority of his tradition; a statement which may be verified without much trouble by any one who likes to make a short journey. That our Firmilian held this belief is testified by the writings which he has left.[fn-19-P1936_525706:627-nf] The contemporaries also of the illustrious Meletius say that he was of this opinion. But why quote ancient authorities? Now in the East are not the maintainers of true religion known chiefly by this one term, and separated from their adversaries as by a watchword? I have heard from a certain Mesopotamian, a man at once well skilled in the language and of unperverted opinions, that by the usage of his country it is impossible for any one, even though he may wish to do so, to express himself in any other way, and that they are compelled by the idiom of their mother tongue to offer the doxology by the syllable \"and,\" or, I should more accurately say, by their equivalent expressions. We Cappadocians, too, so speak in the dialect of our country, the Spirit having so early. as the division of tongues foreseen the utility of the phrase. And what of the whole West, almost from Illyricum to the boundaries of our world? Does it not support this word?","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"The imperial law[fn-11-P1135_497802:66-nf] which forbade Christians to study Greek literature, rendered the two Apollinares of whom we have above spoken, much more distinguished than before. For both being skilled in polite learning, the father as a grammarian, and the son as a rhetorician, they made themselves serviceable to the Christians at this crisis. For the former, as a grammarian, composed a grammar consistent with the Christian faith: he also translated the Books of Moses into heroic verse; and paraphrased all the historical books of the Old Testament, putting them partly into dactylic measure, and partly reducing them to the form of dramatic tragedy. He purposely employed all kinds of verse, that no form of expression peculiar to the Greek language might be unknown or unheard of amongst Christians. The younger Apollinaris, who was well trained in eloquence, expounded the gospels and apostolic doctrines in the way of dialogue, as Plato among the Greeks had done. Thus showing themselves useful to the Christian cause they overcame the subtlety of the emperor through their own labors. But Divine Providence was more potent than either their labors, or the craft of the emperor: for not long afterwards, in the manner we shall hereafter explain,[fn-11-P1136_499071:67-nf] the law became wholly inoperative; and the works of these men are now of no greater importance, than if they had never been written. But perhaps some one will vigorously reply saying: `On what grounds do you affirm that both these things were effected by the providence of God? That, the emperor's sudden death was very advantageous to Christianity is indeed evident: but surely the rejection of the Christian compositions of the two Apollinares, and the Christians beginning afresh to imbue their minds with the philosophy of the heathens, this works out no benefit to Christianity, for pagan philosophy teaches Polytheism, and is injurious to the promotion of true religion.' This objection I shall meet with such considerations as at present occur to me. Greek literature certainly was never recognized either by Christ or his Apostles as divinely inspired, nor on the other hand was it wholly rejected as pernicious. And this they did, I conceive, not inconsiderately. For there were many philosophers among the Greeks who were not far from the knowledge of God; and in fact these being disciplined by logical science, strenuously opposed the Epicureans and other contentious Sophists who denied Divine Providence, confuting their ignorance. And for these reasons they have become useful to all lovers of real piety: nevertheless they themselves were not acquainted with the Head of true religion, being ignorant of the mystery of Christ which `had been hidden from generations and ages.'[fn-11-P1137_500579:68-nf] And that this was so, the Apostle in his epistle to the Romans thus declares:[fn-11-P1138_500674:69-nf] `For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has shown it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, that they may be without excuse; because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.' From these words it appears that they had the knowledge of truth, which God had manifested to them; but were guilty on this account, that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God. Wherefore by not forbidding the study of the learned works of the Greeks, they left it to the discretion of those who wished to do so. This is our first argument in defense of the position we took: another may be thus put: The divinely inspired Scriptures undoubtedly inculcate doctrines that are both admirable in themselves, and heavenly in their character: they also eminently tend to produce piety and integrity of life in those who are guided by their precepts, pointing out a walk of faith which is highly approved of God. But they do not instruct us in the art of reasoning, by means of which we may be enabled successfully to resist those who oppose the truth. Besides adversaries are most easily foiled, when we can use · their own weapons against them. But this power was not supplied to Christians by the writings of the Apollinares. Julian had this in mind when he by law prohibited Christians from being educated in Greek literature, for he knew very well that the fables it contains would expose the whole pagan system, of which he had become the champion to ridicule and contempt. Even Socrates, the most celebrated of their philosophers, despised these absurdities, and was condemned on account of it, as if he had attempted to violate the sanctity of their deities. Moreover, both Christ and his Apostle enjoin us `to become discriminating money-changers,'[fn-11-P1139_502747:70-nf] so that we might `prove all things, and hold fast that which is good':[fn-11-P1140_502909:71-nf] directing us also to `beware lest any one should spoil us through philosophy and vain deceit.'[fn-11-P1141_503025:72-nf] But this we cannot do, unless we possess ourselves of the weapons of our adversaries: taking care that in making this acquisition we do not adopt their sentiments, but testing them, reject the evil, but retain all that is good and true: for good wherever it is found, is a property of truth. Should any one imagine that in making these assertions we wrest the Scriptures from their legitimate construction, let it be remembered that the Apostle not only does not forbid our being instructed in Greek learning, but that he himself seems by no means to have neglected it, inasmuch as he knows many of the sayings of the Greeks. Whence did he get the saying, `The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow-bellies,'[fn-11-P1142_503758:73-nf] but from a perusal of The Oracles of Epimenides,[fn-11-P1143_503824:74-nf] the Cretan Initiator? Or how would he have known this, `For we are also his offspring,'[fn-11-P1144_504341:75-nf] had he not been acquainted with The Phenomena of Aratus[fn-11-P1145_504417:76-nf] the astronomer? Again this sentence, `Evil communications corrupt good manners,'[fn-11-P1146_504543:77-nf] is a sufficient proof that he was conversant with the tragedies of Euripides.[fn-11-P1147_504641:78-nf] But what need is there of enlarging on this point? It is well known that in ancient times the doctors of the church by unhindered usage were accustomed to exercise themselves in the learning of the Greeks, until they had reached an advanced age: this they did with a view to improve themselves in eloquence and to strengthen and polish their mind, and at the same time to enable them to refute the errors of the heathen.

And because a piety-such as it was-compelled me to believe that the good God never created any evil nature, I conceived two masses, the one opposed to the other, both infinite, but the evil the more contracted, the good the more expansive. And from this mischievous commencement the other profanities followed on me. For when my mind tried to revert to the Catholic faith, I was cast back, since what I had held to be the Catholic faith was not so.

They have seen that whatever is changeable is not the most high God, and therefore they have transcended every soul and all changeable spirits in seeking the supreme. They have seen also that, in every changeable thing, the form which makes it that which it is, whatever be its mode or nature, can only be through Him who truly is, because He is unchangeable. And therefore, whether we consider the whole body of the world, its figure, qualities, and orderly movement, and also all the bodies which are in it; or whether we consider all life, either that which nourishes and maintains, as the life of trees, or that which, besides this, has also sensation, as the life of beasts; or that which adds to all these intelligence, as the life of man; or that which does not need the support of nutriment, but only maintains, feels, understands, as the life of angels,-all can only be through Him who absolutely is. For to Him it is not one thing to be, and another to live, as though He could be, not living; nor is it to Him one thing to live, and another thing to understand, as though He could live, not understanding; nor is it to Him one thing to understand, another thing to be blessed, as though He could understand and not be blessed. But to Him to live, to understand, to be blessed, are to be. They have understood, from this unchangeableness and this simplicity, that all things must have been made by Him, and that He could Himself have been made by none. For they have considered that whatever is is either body or life, and that life is something better than body, and that the nature of body is sensible, and that of life intelligible. Therefore they have preferred the intelligible nature to the sensible. We mean by sensible things such things as can be perceived by the sight and touch of the body; by intelligible things, such as can be understood by the sight of the mind For there is no corporeal beauty, whether in the condition of a body, as figure, or in its movement, as in music, of which it is not the mind that judges. But this could never have been, had there not existed in the mind itself a superior form of these things, without bulk, without noise of voice, without space and time. But even in respect of these things, had the mind not been mutable, it would not have been possible for one to judge better than another with regard to sensible forms. He who is clever, judges better than he who is slow, he who is skilled than he who is unskillful, he who is practised than he who is unpractised; and the same person judges better after he has gained experience than he did before.

I have specially chosen them because their juster thoughts concerning the one God who made heaven and earth, have made them illustrious among philosophers. This has given them such superiority to all others in the judgment of posterity, that, though Aristotle, the disciple of Plato, a man of eminent abilities, inferior in eloquence to Plato, yet far superior to many in that respect, had rounded the Peripatetic sect,-so called because they were in the habit of walking about during their disputations,-and though he had, through the greatness of his fame, gathered very many disciples into his school, even during the life of his master; and though Plato at his death was succeeded in his school, which was called the Academy, by Speusippus, his sister's son, and Xenocrates, his beloved disciple, who, together with their successors, were called from this name of the school, Academics; nevertheless the most illustrious recent philosophers, who have chosen to follow Plato, have been unwilling to be called Peripatetics, or Academics, but have preferred the name of Platonists. Among these were the renowned Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, who were Greeks, and the African Apuleius, who was learned both in the Greek and Latin tongues.

But when Hermes predicts these things, he speaks as one who is a friend to these same mockeries of demons, and does not clearly express the name of Christ. On the contrary, he deplores, as if it had already taken place, the future abolition of those things by the observance of which there was maintained in Egypt a resemblance of heaven,-he bears witness to Christianity by a kind of mournful prophecy. Now it was with reference to such that the apostle said, that \"knowing God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of corruptible man,\"[fn-14-P1434_808441:26-nf] and so on, for the whole passage is too long to quote.

For it can sooner happen that man, who has received an honorable position, may, through lack of understanding, become comparable to the beasts, than that the works of man may become preferable to the work of God, made in His own image, that is, to man himself.

Now this is the reason why the law gives its command, - to admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that he to whom the command is given, if he is as yet unable to perform it, may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability, and complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the ability comes. \"For we have received not the spirit of this world,\" says again that most constant preacher of grace, \"but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-14-P1420_693454:95-nf] What, however, \"is the spirit of this world,\" but the spirit of pride? By it their foolish heart is darkened, who, although knowing God, glorified Him not as God, by giving Him thanks.[fn-14-P1421_693660:96-nf] Moreover, it is really by this same spirit that they too are deceived, who, while ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to God's righteousness.[fn-14-P1422_693890:97-nf] It appears to me, therefore, that he is much more \"a child of faith\" who has learned from what source to hope for what he has not yet, than he who attributes to himself whatever he has; although, no doubt, to both of these must be preferred the man who both has, and at the same time knows from whom he has it, if nevertheless he does not believe himself to be what he has not yet attained to. Let him not fall into the mistake of the Pharisee, who, while thanking God for what he possessed, yet failed to ask for any further gift, just as if he stood in, want of nothing for the increase or perfection of his righteousness.[fn-14-P1423_694531:98-nf] Now, having duly considered and weighed all these circumstances and testimonies, we conclude that a man is not justified by the precepts of a holy life, but by faith in Jesus Christ,-in a word, not by the law of works, but by the law of faith; not by the letter,but by the spirit; not by the merits of deeds, but by free grace.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"159","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Has the apostle perhaps mentioned those Gentiles as having the law written in their hearts who belong to the new testament?

We now speak of that faith which we employ when we believe anything, not that which we give when we make a promise; for this too is called faith.[fn-17-P1716_769393:295-nf] We use the word in one sense when we say, \"He had no faith in me,\" and in another sense when we say, \"He did not keep faith with me.\" The one phrase means, \"He did not Believe what I said;\" the other, \"He did not do what he promised.\" According to the faith by which we believe, we are faithful to God; but according to that whereby a thing is brought to pass which is promised, God Himself even is faithful to us; for the apostle declares, \"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.\"[fn-17-P1717_770129:296-nf] Well, now, the former is the faith about which we inquire, Whether it be in our power? even the faith by which we believe God, or believe on God. For of this it is written, \"Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.\"[fn-17-P1718_770394:297-nf] And again, \"To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.\"[fn-17-P1719_770542:298-nf] Consider now whether anybody believes, if he be unwilling; or whether he believes not, if he shall have willed it. Such a position, indeed, is absurd (for what is believing but consenting to the truth of what is said? and this consent is certainly voluntary): faith, therefore, is in our own power. But, as the apostle says: \"There is no power but comes from God,\"[fn-17-P1720_770926:299-nf] what reason then is there why it may not be said to us even of this: \"What hast thou which thou hast not received?\"[fn-17-P1721_771063:300-nf] -for it is God who gave us even to believe. Nowhere, however, in Holy Scripture do we find such an assertion as, There is no volition but comes from God. And rightly is it not so written, because it is not true: otherwise God would be the author even of sins (which Heaven forbid!), if there were no volition except what comes from Him; inasmuch as an evil volition alone is already a sin, even if the effect be wanting,-in other words, if it has not ability. But when the evil volition receives ability to accomplish its intention, this proceeds from the judgment of God, with whom there is no unrighteousness.[fn-17-P1722_771696:301-nf] He indeed punishes after this manner; nor is His chastisement unjust because it is secret. The ungodly man, however, is not aware that he is being punished, except when he unwillingly discovers by an open penalty how much evil he has willingly committed. This is just what the apostle says of certain men: \"God hath given them up to the evil desires of their own hearts, . . . to do those things that are not convenient.\"[fn-17-P1723_772138:302-nf] Accordingly, the Lord also said to Pilate: \"Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\"[fn-17-P1724_772291:303-nf] But still, when the ability is given, surely no necessity is imposed. Therefore, although David had received ability to kill Saul, he preferred sparing to striking him.[fn-17-P1725_772483:304-nf] Whence we understand that bad men receive ability for the condemnation of their depraved will, while good men receive ability for trying of their good will.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"183","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But there is yet another distinction to be observed,-since they who are under the law both attempt to work their own righteousness through fear of punishment, and fail to do God's righteousness, because this is accomplished by the love to which only what is lawful is pleasing, and never by the fear which is forced to have in its work the thing which is lawful, although it has something else in its will which would prefer, if it were only possible, that to be lawful which is not lawful. These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which is said of them, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled?\"[fn-17-P1738_775648:311-nf] Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it?

It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now applicable: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;\"[fn-18-P1841_803645:387-nf] but in reference to the present life the following: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\"[fn-18-P1842_803803:388-nf] To the one, again, belongs, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-18-P1843_803875:389-nf] to the other, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-18-P1844_803945:390-nf] To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,-so that in the one the just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_09_lecture_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"19.

Without doubt the circle (I mean the plane figure described by a single line) is beyond our perception, and it is impossible for us to find out where it begins or where it ends; but we ought not on this account to believe it to be without a beginning. Although we are not sensible of it, it really begins at some point where the draughtsman has begun to draw it at a certain radius from the centre.[fn-19-P1999_554186:9-nf] Thus seeing that figures which move in a circle always return upon themselves, without for a single instant interrupting the regularity of their course, do not vainly imagine to yourselves that the world has neither beginning nor end. \"For the fashion of this world passeth away\"[fn-20-P2000_554681:10-nf] and \"Heaven and earth shall pass away.\"[fn-20-P2001_554742:11-nf] The dogmas of the end, and of the renewing of the world, are announced beforehand in these short words put at the head of the inspired history. \"In the beginning God made.\" That which was begun in time is condemned to come to an end in time.

Such being the different senses of the word beginning, see if we have not all the meanings here. You may know the epoch when the formation of this world began, it, ascending into the past, you endeavour to discover the first day. You will thus find what was the first movement of time; then that the creation of the heavens and of the earth were like the foundation and the groundwork, and afterwards that an intelligent reason, as the word beginning indicates, presided in the order of visible things.[fn-20-P2017_563415:23-nf] You will finally discover that the world was not conceived by chance and without reason, but for an useful end and for the great advantage of all beings, since it is really the school where reasonable souls exercise themselves, the training ground where they learn to know God; since by the sight of visible and sensible things the mind is led, as by a hand, to the contemplation of invisible things. \"For,\" as the Apostle says, \"the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.\"[fn-20-P2018_564513:24-nf] Perhaps these words \"In the beginning God created\" signify the rapid and imperceptible moment of creation. The beginning, in effect, is indivisible and instantaneous. The beginning of the road is not yet the road, and that of the house is not yet the house; so the beginning of time is not yet time and not even the least par-title of it. If some objector tell us that the beginning is a time, he ought then, as he knows well, to submit it to the division of time-a beginning, a middle and an end. Now it is ridiculous to imagine a beginning of a beginning. Further, if we divide the beginning into two, we make two instead of one, or rather make several, we really make an infinity, for all that which is divided is divisible to the infinite.[fn-20-P2019_565273:25-nf] Thus then, if it is said, \"In the beginning God created,\" it is to teach us that at the will of God the world arose in less than an instant, and it is to convey this meaning more clearly that other interpreters have said: \"God made summarily\" that is to say all at once and in a moment.[fn-20-P2020_565697:26-nf] But enough concerning the beginning, if only to put a few points out of many.","title":"Homily I.-In the Beginning God Made the Heaven and the Earth.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_13_homily_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"5.

Grow in the ability to distinguish good from evil, and cleave more and more to the Mediator, who delivers you from evil; which does not admit of a local separation from you, but rather of being healed within you. But whoever shall say to you, Believe not Christ to be truly man, or that the body of any man or animal whatever was created by the true God, or that the Old Testament was given by the true God, and anything else of the same sort, for such things as these were not told you previously, when your nourishment was milk, because your heart was still unfit for the apprehension of the truth: such an one provides you not with meat, but with poison. For therefore it was that the blessed apostle, in addressing those who appeared to him already perfect, even after calling himself imperfect, said, \"Let us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.\" And that they might not rush into the hands of seducers, whose desire would be to turn them away from the faith by promising them the knowledge of the truth, and suppose such to be the meaning of the apostle's words, \"God shall reveal even this unto you,\" he forthwith added, \"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.\"[fn-32-P3263_1820952:19-nf] If, then, thou hast come to some understanding of what is not at variance with the rule of the Catholic faith, whereto thou hast attained as the way that is guiding thee to thy fatherland; and hast so understood it as to feel it a duty to dismiss all doubts whatever on the subject: add to the building, but do not abandon the foundation. And surely of such a character ought to be any teaching given by eiders to those who are babes, as not to involve the assertion that Christ the Lord of all, and the prophets and apostles, who are much farther advanced in age than themselves, had in any respect spoken falsely. And not only ought you to avoid the babbling seducers of the mind, who prate away at their fables and falsehoods, and in such vanities make the promise, forsooth, of profound science contrary to the rule of faith, which we have accepted as Catholic; but avoid those also as a still more insidious pest than the others, who discuss truthfully enough the immutability of the divine nature, or the incorporeal creature, or the Creator, and fully prove what they affirm by the most conclusive documents and reasonings, and yet attempt to turn you away from the one Mediator between God and men.

For such expressions are customary in the Scriptures; and yet some persons, while maintaining the Catholic faith, do not carefully attend to them, in such wise that they think the words, \"God made man in the image of God,\" to mean that the Father made man after the image of the Son; and they thus desire to assert that the Son also is called God in the divine Scriptures, as if there were not other most true and clear proofs wherein the Son is called not only God, but also the true God. For whilst they aim at explaining another difficulty in this text, they become so entangled that they cannot extricate themselves. For if the Father made man after the image of the Son, so that he is not the image of the Father, but of the Son, then the Son is unlike the Father. But if a pious faith teaches us, as it does. that the Son is like the Father after an equality of essence, then that which is made in the likeness of the Son must needs also be made in the likeness of the Father. Further, if the Father made man not in His own image, but in the image of His Son, why does He not say, \"Let us make man afterThy image and likeness,\" whereas He does say, \"our;\" unless it be because the image of the Trinity was made in man, that in this way man should be the image of the one true God, because the Trinity itself is the one true God? Such expressions are innumerable in the Scriptures, but it will suffice to have produced these. It is so said in the Psalms, \"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; Thy blessing is upon Thy people;\"[fn-15-P1524_747000:7-nf] as if the words were spoken to some one else, not to Him of whom it had been said, \"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord.\" And again, \"For by Thee,\" he says, \"I shall be delivered from temptation, and by hoping in my God I shall leap over the wall;\"[fn-15-P1525_747262:8-nf] as if he said to some one else, \"By Thee I shall be delivered from temptation.\" And again, \"In the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under Thee;\"[fn-15-P1526_747445:9-nf] as if he were to say, in the heart of Thy enemies. For he had said to that King, that is, to our Lord Jesus Christ, \"The people fall under Thee,\" whom he intended by the word King, when he said, \"In the heart of the king's enemies.\" Things of this kind are found more rarely in the New Testament. But yet the apostle says to the Romans, \"Concerning His Son who was made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord;\"[fn-15-P1527_748025:10-nf] as though he were speaking above of some one else. For what is meant by the Son of God declared by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ, except of the same Jesus Christ who was declared to be Son of God with power? And as then in this passage, when we are told, \"the Son of God with power of Jesus Christ,\" or \"the Son of God according to the spirit of holiness of Jesus Christ,\" or \"the Son of God by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ,\" whereas it might have been expressed in the ordinary way, In His own power, or according to the spirit of His own holiness, or by the resurrection of His dead, or of their dead: as, I says we are not compelled to understand another person, but one and the same, that is, the person of the Son of God our Lord Jesus Christ; so, when we are told that \"God made man in the image of God,\" although it might have been more usual to say, after His own image, yet we are not compelled to understand any other person in the Trinity, but the one and selfsame Trinity itself, who is one God, and after whose image man is made.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Perhaps, however, it is waste of time to linger long over such follies. Let us pass to the next point of his statement. He adds to what he had already said, \"Not standing in need, in the act of creation, of matter or parts or natural instruments: for He stands in need of nothing.\" This proposition, though Eunomius states it with a certain looseness of phrase, we yet do not reject as inconsistent with godly doctrine. For learning as we do that \"He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created[fn-10-P1053_571210:76-nf] ,\"we know that the Word is the Creator of matter, by that very act also producing with the matter the qualitiesof matter, so that for Him the impulse of Hisalmighty will was everything and instead of everything, matter, instrument, place, time, essence, quality, everything that is conceived in creation. For at one and the same time did He will that that which ought to be should be, and His power, that produced all things that are, kept pace with His will, turning His will into act. For thus the mighty Moses in the record of creation instructs us about the Divine power, ascribing the production of each of the objects that were manifested in the creation to the words that bade them be. For \"God said,\" he tells us, \"Let there be light, and there was light[fn-10-P1054_572021:77-nf] :\" and so about the rest, without any mention either of matter or of any instrumental agency. Accordingly the language of Eunomius on this point is not to be rejected. For God, when creating all things that have their origin by creation, neither stood in need of any matter on which to operate, nor of instruments to aid Him in His construction: for the power and wisdom of God has no need of any external assistance. But Christ is \"the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-10-P1055_572509:78-nf] ,\" by Whom all things were made and without Whom is no existent thing, as John testifies[fn-10-P1056_572617:79-nf] . If, then, all things were made by Him, both visible and invisible, and if His will alone suffices to effect the subsistence of existing things (for His will is power), Eunomius utters our doctrine though with a loose mode of expression[fn-10-P1057_572878:80-nf] . For what instrument and what matter could He Who upholds all thinsg by the word of His power[fn-10-P1058_573089:81-nf] need in upholding the constitution of existing things by His almighty word? But if he maintains that what we have believed to be true of the Only-begotten in the case of the creation, is true also in the case of the Son -in the sense that the Father created Him in like manner as the creation was made by the Son,-then we retract our former statement, because such a supposition is a denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten. For we have learnt from the mighty utterance of Paul that it is the distinguishing feature of idolatry to worship and serve the creature more than the Creator[fn-10-P1059_573733:82-nf] , as well as from David, when He says \"There shall no new God be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any alien God[fn-10-P1060_573869:83-nf] .\" We use this line and rule to arrive at the discernment of the object of worship, so as to be convinced that that alone is God which is neither \"new\" nor \"alien.\" Since then we have been taught to believe that the Only-begotten God is God, we acknowledge, by our belief that He is God, that He is neither \"new\" or \"alien.\" If, then, He is God, He is not \"new,\" and if He is not new, He is assuredly eternal. Accordingly, neither is the Eternal \"new,\" nor is He Who is of the Father and in the bosom of the Father and Who has the Father in Himself \"alien\" from true Deity. Thus he who severs the Son from the nature of the Father either absolutely disallows the worship of the Son, that he may not worship an alien God, or bows down before an idol, making a creature and not God the object of his worship, and giving to his idol the name of Christ.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"What is this vain juggling with words? Is he aware that it is God of Whom he speaks, Who was in the beginning and is in the Father, nor was there any time when He was not? He knows not what he says nor whereof he affirms[fn-11-P1108_599924:119-nf] , but he endeavours, as though he were constructing the pedigree of a mere man, to apply to the Lord of all creation the language which properly belongs to our nature here below. For, to take an example, Ishmael was not before the generation that brought him into being, and before his birth there was of course an interval of time. But with Him Who is \"the brightness of glory[fn-11-P1109_600326:120-nf] ,\" \"before\" and \"after\" have no place: for before the brightness, of course neither was there any glory, for concurrently with the existence of the glory there assuredly beams forth its brightness; and it is impossible in the nature of things that one should be severed from the other, nor is it possible to see the glory by itself before its brightness. For he who says thus will make out the glory in itself to be darkling and dim, if the brightness from it does not shine out at the same time. But this is the unfair method of the heresy, to endeavour, by the notions and terms employed concerning the Only-begotten God, to displace Him from His oneness with the Father. It is to this end they say, \"Before the generation that brought Him into being He was not Son:\" but the \"sons of rams[fn-11-P1110_601140:121-nf] ,\" of whom the prophet speaks,-are not they too called sons after coming into being? That quality, then, which reason notices in the \"sons of rams,\" that they are not \"sons of rams\" before the generation which brings them into being,-this our reverend divine now ascribes to the Maker of the worlds and of all creation, Who has the Eternal Father in Himself, and is contemplated in the eternity of the Father, as He Himself says, \"I am in the Father, and the Father in Me[fn-11-P1111_601647:122-nf] .\" Those, however, who are not able to detect the sophistry that lurks in his statement, and are not trained to any sort of logical perception, follow these inconsequent statements and receive what comes next as a logical consequence of what preceded. For he says, \"coming into being before all creation,\" and as though this were not enough to prove his impiety, he has a piece of profanity in reserve in the phrase that follows, when he terms the Son \"not uncreate.\" In what sense then does he call Him Who is not uncreate \"very Son\"? For if it is meet to call Him Who is not uncreate \"very Son,\" then of course the heaven is \"very Son;\" for it too is \"not uncreate.\" So the sun too is \"very Son,\" and all that the creation contains, both small and great, are of course entitled to the appellation of \"very Son.\" And in what sense does He call Him Who has come into being \"Only-begotten\"? For all things that come into being are unquestionably in brotherhood with each other, so far, I mean, as their coming into being is concerned. And from whom did He come into being? For assuredly all things that have ever come into being did so from the Son. For thus did John testify, saying, \"All things were made by Him[fn-11-P1112_602884:123-nf] .\" If then the Son also came into being, according to Eunomius' creed, He is certainly ranked in the class of things which have come into being. If then all things that came into being were made by Him, and the Word is one of the things that came into being, who is so dull as not to draw from these premises the absurd conclusion that our new creed-monger makes out the Lord of creation to have been His own work, in saying in so many words that the Lord and Maker of all creation is \"not uncreate\"? Let him tell us whence he has this boldness assertion. From what inspired utterance? What evangelist, what apostle ever uttered such words as these? What prophet, what lawgiver, what patriarch, what other person of all who were divinely moved by the Holy Ghost, whose voices are preserved in writing, ever originated such a statement as this? In the tradition of the faith delivered by the Truth we are taught to believe in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. If it were right to believe that the Son was created, how was it that the Truth in delivering to us this mystery bade us believe in the Son, and not in the creature? and how is it that the inspired Apostle, himself adoring Christ, lays it down that they who worship the creature besides the Creator are guilty of idolatry[fn-11-P1113_604183:124-nf] ? For, were the Son created, either he would not have wor-shipped Him, or he would have refrained from classing those who worship the creature along with idolaters, lest he himself should appear to be an idolater, in offering adoration to the created. But he knew that He Whom he adored was God over all[fn-11-P1114_604628:125-nf] , for so he terms theSon in his Epistle to the Romans. Why then do those who divorce the Son from the essence of the Father, and call Him creature, bestow on Him i mockery the fictitious title of Deity, idly conferring on one alien from true Divinity the name of \"God,\" as they might confer it on Bel or Dagon or the Dragon?

For we wished to ascend, as it were, by steps, and to seek in the inner man, both in knowledge and in wisdom, a sort of trinity of its own special kind, such as we sought before in the outer man; in order that we may come, with a mind more practised in these lower things, to the contemplation of that Trinity which is God, according to our little measure, if indeed, we can even do this, at least in a riddle and as through a glass.[fn-17-P1734_866694:59-nf] If, then, any one have committed to memory the words of this faith in their sounds alone, not knowing what they mean, as they commonly who do not know Greek hold in memory Greek words, or similarly Latin ones, or thoseof any other language of which they are ignorant, has not he a sort of trinity in his mind? because, first, those sounds of words are in his memory, even when he does not think thereupon; and next, the mental vision (acies) of his act of recollection is formed thence when he conceives of them; and next, the will of him who remembers and thinks unites both. Yet we should by no means say that the man in so doing busies himself with a trinity of the interior man, but rather of the exterior; because he remembers, and when he wills, contemplates as much as he wills, that alone which belongs to the sense of the body, which is called hearing. Nor in such an act of thought does he do anything else than deal with images of corporeal things, that is, of sounds. But if he holds and recollects what those words signify, now indeed something of the inner man is brought into action; not yet, however, ought he to be said or thought to live according to a trinity of the tuner man, if he does not love those things which are there declared, enjoined, promised. For it is possible for him also to hold and conceive these things, supposing them to be false, in order that he may endeavor to disprove them. Therefore that will, which in this case unites those things which are held in the memory with those things which are thence impressed on the mind's eye in conception, completes, indeed, some kind of trinity, since itself is a third added to two others; but the man does not live according to this, when those things which are conceived are taken to be false, and are not accepted. But when those things are believed to be true, and those things which therein ought to be loved, are loved, then at last the man does live according to a trinity of the inner man; for every one lives according to that which he loves. But how can things be loved which are not known, but only believed? This question has been already treated of in former books;[fn-17-P1735_868877:60-nf] and we found, that no one loves what he is wholly ignorant of, but that when things not known are said to be loved, they are loved from those things which are known. And now we so conclude this book, that we admonish the just to live by faith,[fn-17-P1736_869171:61-nf] which faith worketh by love,[fn-17-P1737_869218:62-nf] so that the virtues also themselves, by which one lives prudently, boldly, temperately, and justly, be all referred to the same faith; for not otherwise can they be true virtues. And yet these in this life are not of so great worth, as that the remission of sins, of some kind or other, is not sometimes necessary here; and this remission comes not to pass, except through Him, who by His own blood conquered the prince of sinners. Whatsoever ideas are in the mind of the faithful man from this faith, and from such a life, when they are contained in the memory, and are looked at by recollection, and please the will, set forth a kind of trinity of its own sort.[fn-17-P1738_869898:63-nf] But the image of God, of which by His help we shall afterwards speak, is not yet in that trinity; a thing which will then be more apparent, when it shall have been shown where it is, which the reader may expect in a succeeding book.

Will the body be a hindrance to it or not, if one shall admit it as an associate in the search after knowledge? I have a similar question to ask: Have the faculties of their sight and hearing any truth and reality for human beings or not? Is it not the case, that even the poets are always muttering against us, that we can never hear or see anything for certain? He remembered, no doubt, what Epicharmus the comic poet had said: \"It is the mind which sees, the mind that hears-all else is blind and deaf.\" To the same purport he says again, that man is the wisest whose mental power is the clearest; who never applies the sense of sight, nor adds to his mind the help of any such faculty, but employs the intellect itself in unmixed serenity when he indulges in contemplation for the purpose of acquiring an unalloyed insight into the nature of things; divorcing himself with all his might from his eyes and ears and (as one must express himself) from the whole of his body, on the ground of its disturbing the soul, and not allowing it to possess either truth or wisdom, whenever it is brought into communication with it. We see, then, that in opposition to the bodily senses another faculty is provided of a much more serviceable character, even the powers of the soul, which produce an understanding of that truth whose realities are not palpable nor open to the bodily senses, but are very remote from men's everyday knowledge, lying in secret-in the heights above, and in the presence of God Himself. For Plato maintains that there are certain invisible substances, incorporeal, celestial,[fn-27-P2755_927119:133-nf] divine, and eternal, which they call ideas, that is to say, (archetypal) forms, which are the patterns and causes of those objects of nature which are manifest to us, and lie under our corporeal senses: the former, (according to Plato, ) are the actual verities, and the latter the images and likenesses of them. Well, now, are there not here gleams of the heretical principles of the Gnostics and the Valentinians? It is from this philosophy that they eagerly adopt the difference between the bodily senses and the intellectual faculties,-a distinction which they actually apply to the parable of the ten virgins: making the five foolish virgins to symbolize the five bodily senses, seeing that these are so silly and so easy to be deceived; and the wise virgin to express the meaning of the intellectual faculties, which are so wise as to attain to that mysterious and supernal truth, which is placed in the pleroma. (Here, then, we have) the mystic original of the ideas of these heretics. For in this philosophy lie both their ¦ons and their genealogies. Thus, too, do they divide sensation, both into the intellectual powers from their spiritual seed, and the sensuous faculties from the animal, which cannot by any means comprehend spiritual things. From the former germ spring invisible things; from the latter, visible things which are grovelling and temporary, and which are obvious to the senses, placed as they are in palpable forms.[fn-27-P2756_928614:134-nf] It is because of these views that we have in a former passage stated as a preliminary fact, that the mind is nothing else than an apparatus or instrument of the soul,[fn-27-P2757_928800:135-nf] and that the spirit is no other faculty, separate from the soul, but is the soul itself exercised in respiration; although that influence which either God on the one hand, or the devil on the other, has breathed upon it, must be regarded in the light of an additional element.[fn-27-P2758_929111:136-nf] And now, with respect to the difference between the intellectual powers and the sensuous faculties, we only admit it so far as the natural diversity between them requires of us. (There is, of course, a difference) between things corporeal and things spiritual, between visible and invisible beings, between objects which are manifest to the view and those which are hidden from it; because the one class are attributed to sensation, and the other to the intellect. But yet both the one and the other must be regarded as inherent in the soul, and as obedient to it, seeing that it embraces bodily objects by means of the body, in exactly the same way that it conceives incorporeal objects by help of the mind, except that it is even exercising sensation when it is employing the intellect. For is it not true, that to employ the senses is to use the intellect? And to employ the intellect amounts to a use of the senses?[fn-27-P2759_930060:137-nf] What indeed can sensation be, but the understanding of that which is the object of the sensation? And what can the intellect or understanding be, but the seeing of that which is the object understood? Why adopt such excruciating means of torturing simple knowledge and crucifying the truth? Who can show me the sense which does not understand the object of its sensation, or the intellect which perceives not the object which it understands, in so clear away as to prove to me that the one can do without the other? If corporeal things are the objects of sense, and incorporeal ones objects of the intellect, it is the classes of the objects which are different, not the domicile or abode of sense and intellect; in other words, not the soul (anima) and the mind (animus). By what, in Short, are corporeal things perceived? If it is by the soul,[fn-27-P2760_930938:138-nf] then the mind is a sensuous faculty, and not merely an intellectual power; for whilst it understands, it also perceives, because without the perception there is no understanding. If, however, corporeal things are perceived by the soul, then it follows that the soul's power is an intellectual one, and not merely a sensuous faculty; for while it perceives it also understands, because without understanding there is no perceiving. And then, again, by what are incorporeal things understood? If it is by the mind,[fn-27-P2761_931544:139-nf] where will be the soul? If it is by the soul, where will be the mind? For things which differ ought to be mutually absent from each other, when they are occupied in their respective functions and duties. It must be your opinion, indeed, that the mind is absent from the soul on certain occasions; for (you suppose) that we are so made and constituted as not to know that we have seen or heard something, on the hypothesis[fn-27-P2762_931992:140-nf] that the mind was absent at the time. I must therefore maintain that the very soul itself neither saw nor heard, since it was at the given moment absent with its active power-that is to say, the mind. The truth is, that whenever a man is out of his mind,[fn-27-P2763_932282:141-nf] it is his soul that is demented-not because the mind is absent, but because it is a fellow-sufferer (with the soul) at the time.[fn-27-P2764_932428:142-nf] Indeed, it is the soul which is principally affected by casualties of such a kind. Whence is this fact confirmed? It is confirmed from the following consideration: that after the soul's departure, the mind is no longer found in a man: it always follows the soul; nor does it at last remain behind it alone, after death. Now, since it follows the soul, it is also indissolubly attached to it; just as the understanding is attached to the soul, which is followed by the mind, with which the understanding is indissolubly connected. Granted now that the understanding is superior to the senses, and a better discoverer of mysteries, what matters it, so long as it is only a peculiar faculty of the soul, just as the senses themselves are? It does not at all affect my argument, unless the understanding were held to be superior to the senses, for the purpose of deducing from the allegation of such superiority its separate condition likewise. After thus combating their alleged difference, I have also to refute this question of superiority, previous to my approaching the belief (which heresy propounds) in a superior god. On this point, however, of a (superior) god, we shall have to measure swords with the heretics on their own ground.[fn-27-P2765_933938:143-nf] Our present subject concerns the soul, and the point is to prevent the insidious ascription of a superiority to the intellect or understanding. Now, although the objects which are touched by the intellect are of a higher nature, since they are spiritual, than those which are embraced by the senses, since these are corporeal, it will still be only a superiority in the objects-as of lofty ones contrasted with humble-not in the faculties of the intellect against the senses. For how can the intellect be superior to the senses, when it is these which educate it for the discovery of various truths? It is a fact, that these truths are learned by means of palpable forms; in other words, invisible things are discovered by the help of visible ones, even as the apostle tells us in his epistle: \"For the invisible things of Him are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood by the things that are made; \"[fn-27-P2766_934904:144-nf] and as Plato too might inform our heretics: \"The things which appear are the image[fn-27-P2767_935006:145-nf] of the things which are concealed from view,\"[fn-27-P2768_935067:146-nf] whence it must needs follow that this world is by all means an image of some other: so that the intellect evidently uses the senses for its own guidance, and authority, and mainstay; and without the senses truth could not be attained. How, then, can a thing be superior to that which is instrumental to its existence, which is also indispensable to it, and to whose help it owes everything which it acquires? Two conclusions therefore follow from what we have said: (1) That the intellect is not to be preferred above the senses, on the (supposed) ground that the agent through which a thing exists is inferior to the thing itself; and (2) that the intellect must not be separated from the senses, since the instrument by which a thing's existence is sustained is associated with the thing itself.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"And not only on their own account do they experience these emotions, but also on account of those whose deliverance they desire and whose perdition they fear, and whose loss or salvation affects them with grief or with joy.

And therefore that which the Greeks call a0paqeia, and what the Latins would call, if their language would allow them, \"impassibilitas,\" if it be taken to mean an impassibility of spirit and not of body, or, in other words, a freedom from those emotions which are contrary to reason and disturb the mind, then it is obviously a good and most desirable quality, but it is not one which is attainable in this life. For the words of the apostle are the confession, not of the common herd, but of the eminently pious, just, and holy men: \"If we say we have: no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-24-P2408_1340630:79-nf] When there shall be no sin in a man, then there shall be this apa/qeia. At present it is enough if we live without crime; and he who thinks he lives without sin puts aside not sin, but pardon. And if that is to be called apathy, where the mind is the subject of no emotion, then who would not consider this insensibility to be worse than all vices? It may, indeed, reasonably be maintained that the perfect blessedness we hope for shall be free from all sting of fear or sadness; but who thai is not quite lost to truth would say that neither love nor joy shall be experienced there? But if by apathy a condition be meant in which no fear terrifies nor any pain annoys, we must in this life renounce such a state if we would live according to God's will, but may hope to enjoy it in that blessedness which is promised as our eternal condition.","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_13_book_i_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"162","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"126.

For the mutual concurrence of heterogeneous elements in the formation of our body is a kind of a combination harmoniously conjoined out of several dissimilar elements; but when, at the due time, the tie is loosed which bound together this concurrence of the elements, the combined nature is once more dissolved into the elements of which it was composed. This then is rather a work than a passion of the nature[fn-17-P1709_981623:39-nf] . For we give the name of \"passion\" only to that which is opposed to the virtuous unimpassioned state and of this we believe that He Who granted us salvation was at all times devoid, Who \"was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin[fn-17-P1710_982335:40-nf] .\" Of that, at least, which is truly passion, which is a diseased condition of the will, He was not a partaker; for it says \"He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth[fn-17-P1711_982530:41-nf] \"; but the peculiar attributes of our nature, which, by a kind of customary abuse of terms, are called by the same name of \"passion,\" -of these, we confess, the Lord did partake,-of birth, nourishment, growth, of sleep and toil,and all those natural dispositions which the, soul is wont to experience with regard to bodily inconveniences,-the desire of that which is lacking, when the longing passes from the body to the soul, the sense of pain, the dread of death, and all the like, save only such as, if followed, lead to sin. As, then, when we perceive His power extending through all things in heaven, and air, and earth, and sea, whatever there is in heaven, whatever there is beneath the earth, we believe that He is universally present, and yet do not say that He is any of those things in which He is (for He is not the Heaven, Who has marked it out with His enfolding span, nor is He the earth, Who upholds the circle of the earth, nor yet is He the water, Who encompasses the liquid nature), so neither do we say that in passing through those sufferings of the flesh of which we speak He was \"subject to passion,\" but, as we say that He is the cause of all things that are, that He holds the universe in His grasp, that He directs all that is in motion and keeps upon a settled foundation all that is stationary, by the unspeakable power of His own majesty, so we say that He was born among us for the cure of the disease of sin, adapting the exercise of His healing power in a manner corresponding to the suffering, applying the healing in that way which He knew to be for the good of that part of the creation which He knew to be in infirmity. And as it was expedient that He should heal the sufferings by touch, we say that He so healed it; yet is He not, because He is the Healer of our infirmity, to be deemed on this account to have been Himself passible. For even in the case of men, ordinary use does not allow us to affirm such a thing. We do not say that one who touches a sick man to heal him is himself partaker of the infirmity, but we say that he does give the sick man the boon of a return to health, and does not partake of the infirmity: for the suffering does not touch him, it is he who touches the disease. Now if he who by his art works any good in men's bodies is not called dull or feeble, but is called a lover of men and a benefactor and the like, why do they slander the dispensation to usward as being mean and inglorious, and use it to maintain that the essence of the Son is \"divergent by way of inferiority,\" on the ground that the Nature of the Father is superior to sufferings, while that of the Son is not pure from passion? Why, if the aim of the dispensation of the Incarnation was not that the Son should be subject to suffering, but that He should be manifested as a lover of men, while the Father also is undoubtedly a lover of men, it follows that if one will but regard the aim, the Son is in the same case with the Father. But if it was not the Father Who wrought the destruction of death, marvel not,-for all judgment also He hath committed unto the Son, Himself judging no man[fn-17-P1712_985680:42-nf] ; not doing all things by the Son for the reason that He is unable either to save the lost or judge the sinner, but because He does these things too by His own Power, by which He works all things. Then they who were saved by the Son were saved by the Power of the Father, and they who are judged by Him undergo judgment by the Righteousness of God. For \"Christ,\" as the Apostle says, \"is the Righteousness of God[fn-17-P1713_986118:43-nf] ,\" which is revealed by the Gospel; and whether you look at the world as a whole, or at the parts of the world which make up that complete whole, all these are works of the Father, in that they are works of His Power; and thus the word which says both that the Father made all things, and that none of these things that are came into being without the Son, speaks truly on both points; for the operation of the Power bears relation to Him Whose Power It is. Thus, since the Son is the Power of the Father, all the works of the Son are works of the Father. That He entered upon the dispensation of the Passion not by weakness of nature but by the power of His will, one might bring countless passages of the Gospel to show; but these, as the matter is clear, I will pretermit, that my discourse may not be prolonged by dwelling on points that are admitted. If, then, that which comes to pass is evil, we have to separate from that evil not the Father only, but the Son also; but if the saving of them that were lost is good, and if that which took place is not \"passion[fn-17-P1714_987204:44-nf] ,\" but love of men, why do you alienate from our thanksgiving for our salvation the Father, Who by His own Power, which is Christ, wrought for men their freedom from death?","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_22_book_i_","source_chapter":55,"source_paragraph":"165","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But in reference to the particular point in which he quoted the holy Ambrose with so much approbation,-because he found in that author's writings, from the praises he accorded to Zacharias and Elisabeth, the opinion that a man might possibly in this life be without sin;[fn-34-P3489_1337280:130-nf] although this cannot be denied if God wills it, with whom all things are possible, yet he ought to consider more carefully in what sense this was said.

Indeed, even in Solomon there appeared some image of the future event, in that he built the temple, and had peace according to his name (for Solomon means \"pacific\"), and in the beginning of his reign was wonderfully praiseworthy; but while, as a shadow of Him that should come, he foreshowed Christ our Lord, he did not also in his own person resemble Him. Whence some things concerning him are so written as if they were prophesied of himself, while the Holy Scripture, prophesying even by events, somehow delineates in him the figure of things to come. For, besides the books of divine history, in which his reign is narrated, the 72d Psalm also is inscribed in the title with his name, in which so many things are said which cannot at all apply to him, but which apply to the Lord Christ with such evident fitness as makes it quite apparent that in the one the figure is in some way shadowed forth, but in the other the truth itself is presented.

In what circumstances therefore was he? In prison and chains and intolerable perils. Whence is this manifest? From the epistle itself. For earlier than this he says, \"Now I wish you to know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have come rather to the furtherance[fn-8-P849_558518:20-nf] of the Gospel; so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole Court, and to all the others; and a good many[fn-8-P850_558711:21-nf] of the brethren, trusting to my bonds, the more exceedingly dare fearlessly to speak the word.\"[fn-8-P851_558928:22-nf] Now Nero had then cast him into prison.

It was at that time then that the blessed Paul wrote these things. Who would not have been astounded? who would not have marvelled? or rather who could adequately have been astounded at and admired that noble and heaven-reaching soul; in that, while bound in Rome and imprisoned, at so great a distance as that, he wrote a letter to the Philippians? For you know how great is the distance between Macedonia and Rome. But neither did the length of the way, nor the amount of time (required), nor the press of business, nor the peril and the dangers coming one upon another, nor anything else, drive out his love for and remembrance of the disciples; but he retained them all in his mind; and not so strongly were his hands bound with the chains as his soul was bound together and rivetted by his longing for the disciples:[fn-8-P854_560858:25-nf] which very thing itself indeed also declaring, in the preface of the Epistle he said, \"On account of my having you in my heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the Gospel.\"[fn-8-P855_561118:26-nf] And just as a King, having ascended epon his throne at morning-tide and taken his seat in the royal courts, immediately receives from all quarters innumerable letters; so truly he also, just as inh royal courts, seated in the dungeon, both received and sent his letters in far greater number; the nations from all quarters referring to his wisdom everything about[fn-8-P856_561501:27-nf] what had taken place among themselves; and he administered more business than the reigning monarch in proportion to his having had a larger dominion entrusted to him. For in truth God had brought and put into his hands not those who inhabited the country of the Romans only, but also all the barbarians, both land and sea. And by way of showing this he said to the Romans, \"Now I would not that ye should be ignorant, brethren, that ofttimes I have purposed to come to you, and have been hindered until the present; in order that I might have some fruit also among you, as among the rest of the Gentiles too.

Now that we might have that righteousness of faith of which the unbelieving world should be convinced, therefore said the Lord, \"Of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye shall see Me no more.\" As if He had said, \"This shall be your righteousness, that ye believe on Me, the Mediator, of whom ye shall be most fully assured that He is risen again and gone to the Father, though ye see Him not after the Flesh; that by Him reconciled, ye may be able to see God after the Spirit.\" Whence He saith to the woman who represents the Church, when she fell at His Feet after His Resurrection, \"Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to the Father.\"[fn-67-P6768_2846782:16-nf] Which expression is understood mystically, thus. \"Believe not in Me after a carnal manner by means of bodily contact; but thou shall believe after a spiritual manner; that is, with a spiritual faith shalt touch Me, when I shall have ascended to the Father.\" For, \"blessed are they who do not see, and believe.\" And this is the righteousness of faith, of which the world, which hath it not, is convinced of us who are not without it; for \"the just liveth by faith.\"[fn-67-P6769_2847265:17-nf] Whether it be then that as rising again in Him, and in Him coming to the Father, we are invisibly and in justification perfected; or that as not seeing and yet believing we live by faith, for that \"the just liveth by faith;\" with these meanings said He, \"Of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye shall see Me no more.\"","title":"Sermon XCIII.

Nor do I now undertaketo solve a very knotty question, which perplexed those very acute thinkers, the Academic philosophers: whether a wise man ought to give his assent to anything, seeing that he may fall into error by assenting tofalsehood: for all things, as they assert, are either unknown or uncertain. Now I wrote three volumes shortly after my conversion, to remove out of my way the objections which lie, as it were, on the very threshold of faith. And assuredly it was necessary at the very outset to remove this utter despair of reaching truth, which seems to be strengthened by the arguments of these philosophers. Now in their eyes every error is regarded as a sin, and they think that error can only be avoided by entirely suspending belief. For they say that the man who assents to what is uncertain falls into error; and they strive by the most acute, but most audacious arguments, to show that, even though a man's opinion should by chance be true, yet that there is no certainty of its truth, owing to the impossibility of distinguishing truth from falsehood. But with us, \"the just shall live by faith.\"[fn-22-P2276_1134395:27-nf] Now, if assent be taken away, faith goes too; for without assent there can be no belief. And there are truths, whether we know them or not, which must be believed if we would attain to a happy life, that is, to eternal life. But I am not sure whether one ought to argue with men who not only do not know that there is an eternal life before them, but do not know whether they are living at the present moment; nay, say that they do not know what it is impossible they can be ignorant of. For it is impossible that any one should be ignorant that he is alive, seeing that if he be not alive it is impossible for him to be ignorant; for not knowledge merely, but ignorance too, can be an attribute only of the living. But, forsooth, they think that by not acknowledging that they are alive they avoid error, when even their very error proves that they are alive, since one who is not alive cannot err. As, then, it is not only true, but certain, that we are alive, so there are many other things both true and certain; and God forbid that it should ever be called wisdom, and not the height of folly, to refuse assent to these.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":40,"source_paragraph":"214","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Nevertheless, are we on this account to say that the Holy Ghost is the father of the man Christ, and that as God the Father begat the Word, so God the Holy Spirit begat the man, and that these two natures constitute the one Christ; and that as the Word He is the Son of God the Father, and as man the Son of God the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit as His father begat Him of the Virgin Mary? Who will dare to say so? Nor is it necessary to show by reasoning how many other absurdities flow from this supposition, when it is itself so absurd that no believer's ears can bear to hear it. Hence, as we confess, \"Our Lord Jesus Christ, who of God is God, and as man was born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, having both natures, the divine and the human, is the only Son of God the Father Almighty, from whom proceedeth the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-23-P2371_1164208:68-nf] Now in what sense do we say that Christ was born of the Holy Spirit, if the Holy Spirit did not beget Him? Is it that He made Him, since our Lord Jesus Christ, though as God \"all things were made by Him,\"[fn-23-P2372_1164503:69-nf] yet as man was Himself made; as the apostle says, \"who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh?\"[fn-23-P2373_1164629:70-nf] But as that created thing which the Virgin conceived and brought forththough it was united only to the person of the Son, was made by the whole Trinity (for the works of the Trinity are not separable), why should the Holy Spirit alone be mentioned as having made it? Or is it that, when one of the Three is mentioned as the author of any work, the whole Trinity is to be understood as working? That is true, and can be proved by examples. But we need not dwell longer on this solution. For the puzzle is, in what sense it is said, \"born of the Holy Ghost,\" when He is in no sense the Son of the Holy Ghost? For though God made this world, it would not be right to say that it is the Son of God, or that it was born of God; we would say that it was created, or made, or framed, or ordered by Him, or whatever form of expression we can properly use. Here, then, when we make confession that Christ was born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, it is difficult to explain how it is that He is not the Son of the Holy Ghost and is the Son of the Virgin Mary, when He was born both of Him and of her. It is clear beyond a doubt that He was not born of the Holy Spirit as His father, in the same sense that He was born of the Virgin as His mother.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_110_tractate_cv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"8. But perhaps we shall have some fear in saying that He was predestinated, because the apostle seems to have said so only in reference to our being made conformable to His image. As if, indeed, any one, faithfully considering the rule of faith, were to deny that the Son of God was predestinated, who yet cannot deny that He was man. For it is rightly said that He was not predestinated in respect of His being the Word of God, God with God. For how could He be predestinated, seeing He already was what He was, without beginning and without ending, everlasting? But that, which as yet was not, had to be predestinated, in order that it might come to pass in its time, even as it was predestinated so to come before all times. Accordingly, whoever denies predestination of the Son of God, denies that He was also Himself the Son of man. But, on account of those who are disputatious, let us also on this subject listen to the apostle in the exordium of his epistles. For both in the first of his epistles, which is that to the Romans, and in the beginning of the epistle itself, we read: \"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which He had promised afore by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was made for Him of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.\"[fn-34-P3441_1913211:17-nf] In respect, then, of this predestination also, He was gloried before the world was, in order that His glory might be, by the resurrection from the dead, with the Father, at whose right hand He sitteth. Accordingly, when He saw that the time of this, His predestinated glorification, was now come, in order that what had already been done in predestination might also be done now in actual accomplishment, He said in His prayer, \"And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was:\" as if He had said, The glory which I had with Thee, that is, that glory which I had with Thee in Thy predestination, it is time that I should have with Thee also in sitting at Thy right hand.

But, granting that he wrote this,-since you will not hear of anything being spurious in his writings,-it is not against us. For this seems to be Paul's old belief about Jesus, when he thought, like everybody else, that Jesus was the son of David. Afterwards, when he learned that this was false, he corrects himself; and in his Epistle to the Corinthians he says: \"We know no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more.\"[fn-13-P1338_706498:2-nf] Observe the difference between these two verses. In one he asserts that Jesus was the son of David after the flesh; in the other he says that now he knows no man after the flesh. If Paul wrote both, it can only have been in the way I have stated. In the next verse he adds: \"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\" The belief that Jesus was born of the seed of David according to the flesh is of this old transitory kind; whereas the faith which knows no man after the flesh is new and permanent. So, he says elsewhere: \"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.\"[fn-13-P1339_707259:3-nf] We are thus warranted in preferring the new and amended confession of Paul to his old and faulty one. And if you hold by what is said in the Epistle to the Romans, why should not we hold by what is said to the Corinthians? But it is only by your insisting on the correctness of the text that we are made to represent Paul as build ins again the things which he destroyed, in spite of his own repudiation of such prevarication.

If, however, it is rather our desire to read or hear such things as are already prepared for our use and expressed in a superior style, and if the consequence is that we feel it irksome to put together, at the time and with an uncertain issue, the terms of discourse on our own side, then, provided only that our mind does not wander off from the truth of the facts themselves, it is an easy matter for the hearer, if he is offended by anything in our language, to come to see in that very circumstance how little value should be set, supposing the subject itself to be rightly understood, upon the mere fact that there may have been some imperfection or some inaccuracy in the literal expressions, which were employed indeed simply with the view of securing a correct apprehension of the subject-matter. But if the bent of human infirmity has wandered off from the truth of the facts themselves,-although in the catechetical instruction of the unlearned, where we have to keep by the most beaten track, that cannot occur very readily,-still, lest haply it should turn out that our hearer finds cause of offence even in this direction, we ought not to deem this to have come upon us in any other way than as the issue of God's own wish to put us to the test with respect to our readiness to receive correction in calmness of mind, so as not to rush headlong, in the course of a still greater error, into the defense of our error. But if, again, no one has told us of it, and if the thing has altogether escaped our own notice, as well as the observation of our hearers, then there is nothing to grieve over, provided only the same thing does not occur a second time. For the most part, however, when we recall what we have said, we ourselves discover something to find fault with, and are ignorant of the manner in which it was received when it was uttered; and so when charity is fervent within us, we are the more vexed if the thing, while really false, has been received with unquestioning acceptance. This being the case, then, whenever an opportunity occurs, as we have been finding fault with ourselves in silence, we ought in like manner to see to it that those persons be also set right on the subject in a considerate method, who have fallen into some sort of error, not by the words of God, but plainly by those used by us. If, on the other hand, there are any who, blinded by insensate spite, rejoice that we have committed a mistake, whisperers as they are, and slanderers, and \"hateful to God,\"[fn-29-P2921_1352139:70-nf] such characters should afford us matter for the exercise of patience with pity, inasmuch as also the \"patience of God leadeth them to repentance.\"[fn-29-P2922_1352307:71-nf] For what is more detestable, and what more likely to \"treasure up wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,\"[fn-29-P2923_1352479:72-nf] than to rejoice, after the evil likeness and pattern of the devil, in the evil of another? At times, too, even when all is correctly and truly spoken, either something which has not been understood, or something which, as being opposed to the idea and wont of an old error, seems harsh in its very novelty, offends and disturbs the hearer. But if this becomes apparent, and if the person shows himself capable of being set right, he should be set right without any delay by the use of abundance of authorities and reasons. On the other hand, if the offense is tacit and hidden, the medicine ofGod is the effective remedy for it. And if,again, the person starts back and declines to be cured, we should comfort ourselves with that example of our Lord, who, when men were offended at His word, and shrank from it as a hard saying, addressed Himself at the same time to those who had remained, in these terms, \"Will ye also go away?\"[fn-29-P2924_1353427:73-nf] For it ought to be retained as a thoroughly \"fixed and immovable\" position in our heart, that Jerusalem which is in captivity is set free from the Babylon of this world when the times have run their course, and that none belonging to her shall perish: for whoever may perish was not of her. \"For the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His; and, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\"[fn-29-P2925_1353906:74-nf] If we ponder these things, and call upon the Lord to come into our heart, we shall be less apprehensive of the uncertain issues of our discourse, consequent on the uncertain feelings of our hearers; and the very endurance of vexations in the cause of a work of mercy will also be something pleasant to us, if we seek not our own glory in the same. For then is a work truly good, when the aim of the doer gets its impetus from charity,[fn-29-P2926_1354362:75-nf] and, as if returning to its own place, rests again in charity. Moreover, the reading which delights us, or any listening to an eloquence superior to our own, the effect of which is to make us inclined to set a greater value upon it than upon the discourse which we ourselves have to deliver, and so to lead us to speak with a reluctant or tedious utterance, will come upon us in a happier spirit, and will be found to be more enjoyable after labor. Then, too, with a stronger confidence shall we pray to God to speak to us as we wish, if we cheerfully submit to let Him speak by us as we are able.

For my part, I have read the prophets with the most eager attention, and have found no such prophecies. And surely it shows a weak faith not to believe in Christ without proofs and testimonies. Indeed, you yourselves are accustomed to teach that Christian faith is so simple and absolute as not to admit of laborious investigations. Why, then, should you destroy the simplicity of faith by buttressing it with evidences, and Jewish evidences too? Or if you are changing your opinion about evidences, what more trustworthy witness could you have than God Himself testifying to His own Son when He sent Him on earth,-not by a prophet or an interpreter,-by a voice immediately from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, believe Him?\"[fn-13-P1378_733640:1-nf] And again He testifies of Himself: \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world;[fn-13-P1379_733752:2-nf] and in many similar passages. When the Jews quarrelled with this testimony, saying \"Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true,\" He replied: \"Although I bear witness of myself, my witness is true.

I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.\"[fn-13-P1380_734128:3-nf] He does not mention the prophets.

All we look for in the prophets is prudence and virtue, and a good example, which, you are well aware, are not to be found in the Jewish prophets. This, no doubt, explains your referring me at once to their predictions as a reason for believing them, without a word about their actions. This may be good policy, but it is not in harmony. with the declaration of Scripture, that it is impossible to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. This may serve meanwhile as a brief and sufficient reply to the question, why we do not believe the prophets. The fact that they did not prophesy of Christ is abundantly proved in the writings of our fathers. I shall only add this, that if the Hebrew prophets knew and preached Christ, and yet lived such vicious lives, what Paul says of the wise men among the Gentiles might be applied to them: \"Though they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\"[fn-13-P1382_735414:5-nf] You see the knowledge of great things is worth little, unless the life corresponds.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"2.

In this threefold discussion, it would take a long time under the first head to quote from all the books the passages in which Christ may be shown to have been predicted. Faustus' frivolity may be met effectually by the weight of one great authority. Although Faustus does not believe the prophets, he professes to believe the apostles.

And therefore we must explain how we are to understand the words, \"as in the primitive days, and as in former years;\" for perhaps he alludes to the time in which our first parents were in paradise. Then, indeed, intact and pure from all stain and blemish of sin, they offered themselves to God as the purest sacrifices.

And consequently, since it must be believed that after such a cleansing the righteous shall retain no sin, assuredly that time, so far as regards its freedom from sin, can be compared to no other period, unless to that during which our first parents lived in paradise in the most innocent happiness before their transgression.

And inasmuch as there are three things of which man consists,-namely, spirit, soul, and body,-which again are spoken of as two, because frequently the soul is named along with the spirit; for a certain rational portion of the same, of which beasts are devoid, is called spirit: the principal part in us is the spirit; next, the life whereby we are united with the body is called the soul; finally, the body itself, as it is visible, is the last part in us. This \"whole creation\" (creatura), however, \"groaneth and travaileth until now.\"[fn-33-P3307_1516831:117-nf] Nevertheless, He has given it the first-fruits of the Spirit, in that it has believed God, and is now of a good will.[fn-33-P3308_1516971:118-nf] This spirit is also called the mind, regarding which an apostle speaks thus: \"With the mind I serve the law of God.\"[fn-33-P3309_1517264:119-nf] Which apostle likewise expresses himself thus in another passage: \"For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit.\"[fn-33-P3310_1517403:120-nf] Moreover, the soul, when as yet it lusts after carnal good things, is called the flesh. For a certain part thereof resists[fn-33-P3311_1517544:121-nf] the Spirit, not in virtue of nature, but in virtue of the custom of sins; whence it is said, \"With the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And this custom has been turned into a nature, according to mortal generation, by the sin of the first man. Consequently it is also written in this wise, \"And we were sometime by nature the children of wrath,\"[fn-33-P3312_1518089:122-nf] that is, of vengeance, through which it has come to pass that we serve the law of sin. The nature of the soul, however, is perfect when it is made subject to its own spirit, and when it follows that spirit as the same follows God. Therefore \"the animal man[fn-33-P3313_1518365:123-nf] receiveth not the things which are of the Spirit of God.\"[fn-33-P3314_1518474:124-nf] But the soul is not so speedily subdued to the spirit unto good action, as is the spirit to God unto true faith and goodwill; but sometimes its impetus, whereby it moves downwards into things carnal and temporal, is more tardily bridled. But inasmuch as this same soul is also made pure, and receives the stability of its own nature, under the dominance of the spirit, which is the head for it, which head of the said soul has again its own head in Christ, we ought not to despair of the restoration of the body also to its own proper nature. But this certainly will not be effected so speedily as is the case with the soul; just as the soul too, is not restored so speedily as the spirit. Yet it will take place in the appropriate season, at the last trump, when \"the dead shall rise uncorrupted, and we shall be changed.\"[fn-33-P3315_1519321:125-nf] And accordingly we believe also in The Resurrection of the Flesh, to wit, not merely that that soul, which at present by reason of carnal affections is called the flesh, is restored; but that it shall be so likewise with this visible flesh, which is the flesh according to nature, the name of which has been received by the soul, not in virtue of nature, but in reference to carnal affections: this visible flesh, then, I say, which is the flesh properly so called, must without doubt be believed to be destined to rise again. For the Apostle Paul appears to point to this, as it were, with his finger, when he says, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption.\"[fn-33-P3316_1520005:126-nf] For when he says this, he, as it were, directs his finger toward it. Now it is that which is visible that admits of being pointed out with the finger; since the soul might also have been called corruptible, for it is itself corrupted by vices of manners. And when it is read, \"and this mortal [must] put on immortality,\" the same visible flesh is signified, inasmuch as at it ever and anon the finger is thus as it were pointed. For the soul also may thus in like manner be called mortal, even as it is designated corruptible in reference to vices of manners. For assuredly it is \"the death of the soul to apostatize from God;\"[fn-33-P3317_1520655:127-nf] which is its first sin in Paradise, as it is contained in the sacred writings.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_11_homily_iii_on_the_firmament_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"10. \"And God saw that it was good.\"God does not judge of the beauty of His workby the charm of the eyes, and He does not form the same idea of beauty that we do. What He esteems beautiful is that which presents in its perfection all the fitness[fn-21-P2199_657348:61-nf] of art, and that which tends to the usefulness of its end. He, then, who proposed to Himself a manifest design in His works, approved each one of them, as fulfilling its end in accordance with His creative purpose. A hand, an eye, or any portion of a statue lyingapart from the rest, would look beautiful to no one. But if each be restored to its own place, the beauty of proportion, until now almost unperceived, would strike even the most uncultivated. But the artist, before uniting the parts of his work, distinguishes and recognises the beauty of each of them, thinking of the object that he has in view. It is thus that Scripture depicts to us the Supreme Artist, praising each one of His works; soon. when His work is complete, He will accord well deserved praise to the whole together. Let me here end my discourse on the second day, to allow my industrious hearers to examine what they have just heard. May their memory retain it for the profit of their soul; may they by careful meditation inwardly digest and benefit by what I say.

I groan and lament at being compelled to write against a man over whose errors one ought to throw a veil, because he is of the clerical order. Nevertheless I write to defend the cause of the poor whom he is wronging. After being charged with many crimes and excluded from the Communion, pending the assembly of the sacred Synod, in alarm at the decision of the episcopal council he has made his escape from this place, thereby trampling, as he supposed, on the laws of the Church, and, by his contempt of the sentence of excommunication has laid bare his motive. He has undertaken an accusation not even fit for men of mean crafts, and in consequence of his ill-feeling towards the illustrious Philip has proceeded against the wretched tax-payers. I feel that it is quite needless for me to mention his character, his course of life from the beginning and the greatness of his wrong-doings, but this one thing I do beseech your Excellency, not to believe his lies, but to ratify the visitation, and spare the wretched tax-payers. Aye, spare the thrice wretched decurions who cannot exact the moneys demanded of them. Who indeed is ignorant of the severity of the taxation of the acres among us? On this account most of our landowners have fled, our hinds have run away, and the greater part of our lands are deserted. In discussing the land there will be no impropriety in our using geometrical terms. Of our country the length is forty milestones, and the breadth the same. It includes many high mountains, some wholly bare, and some covered with unproductive vegetation. Within this district there are fifty thousand free jugers,[fn-55-P5559_1351663:74-nf] and besides that ten thousand which belong to the imperial treasury. Now only let your wisdom consider how great is the wrong. For if none of the country had been uncultivated, and it had all furnished easy husbandry for the hinds, they would nevertheless have sunk under the tribute, unable to endure the severity of the taxation. And here is a proof of what I say. In the time of Isidorus[fn-55-P5560_1352157:75-nf] of glorious memory, fifteen thousand acres were taxed in gold, but the exactors of the Comitian assessment, unable to bear the loss, frequently complained, and by offerings besought your high dignity to let them off two thousand five hundred for the unproductive acres, and your excellency's predecessors in this office ordered the unproductive acreage to be taken off the unfortunate decurions, and an equivalent number to be substituted for the Comitian; and not even thus are they able to complete the tale.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"212","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"All this I say not for the sake of boasting, but because I am forced to defend myself.

In this sense I say that the same Lord Christ both suffers and destroys suffering; suffers, that is, as touching the visible, and destroys suffering as touching the ineffably indwelling Godhead. This is proved beyond question by the narrative of the holy evangelists, from whom we learn that when lying in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes, He was announced by a star, worshipped by magi and hymned by angels. Thus we reverent discern that the swaddling bands and the want of a bed and all the poverty belonged to the manhood; while the journey of the magi and the guiding of the star and the company of the angels proclaim the Godhead of the unseen.

He was baptized by John; and this shews His sharing what is ours. He is testified to by the Father from on high and is pointed out by the Spirit; this proclaims Him eternal. He hungered; but He fed many thousands with five loaves; the latter is divine, the former human. He thirsted and He asked for water; but He was the well of life; the former of His human weakness, the latter of His divine power. He fell asleep in the boat, but he put the tempest of the sea to sleep; the former of His human nature, the latter of His efficient and creative power which has gifted all things with their being. He was weary as he walked; but He healed the halt and raised dead men from their tombs; the former of human weakness, the latter of a power passing that of this world. He feared death and He destroyed death; the former shows that He was mortal, the latter that He was immortal or rather giver of life. \"He was crucified,\" as the blessed Paul says \"through weakness.\"[fn-65-P6540_1690119:578-nf] But as the same Paul says \"Yet He liveth by the power of God.\"[fn-65-P6541_1690207:579-nf] Let that word \"weakness\" teach us that He was not nailed to the tree as the Almighty, the Uncircumscribed, the Immutable and Invariable, but that the nature quickened by the power of God, was according to the Apostle's teaching dead and buried, both death and burial being proper to the form of the servant. \"He broke the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder\"[fn-65-P6542_1690605:580-nf] and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised His own temple. These are proofs of the form of God in accordance with the Lord's words \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6543_1690834:581-nf] Thus in the one Christ through the sufferings we contemplate the manhood and through the miracles we apprehend the Godhead. We do not divide the two natures into two Christs, and we know that of the Father God the Word was begotten and that of the seed of Abraham and David our nature was assumed. Wherefore also the blessed Paul says when discoursing of Abraham \"He saith not and to seeds as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed which is Christ,\"[fn-65-P6544_1691305:582-nf] and writing to Timothy he says \"Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel.\"[fn-65-P6545_1691456:583-nf] And to the Romans he writes \"Concerning His son Jesus Christ ...which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-65-P6546_1691602:584-nf] And again \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.\"[fn-65-P6547_1691705:585-nf] And the Evangelist writes \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham,\"[fn-65-P6548_1691836:586-nf] and the blessed Peter in the Acts says David \"being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, he seeing this before spake of his resurrection,\"[fn-65-P6549_1692098:587-nf] and God says to Abraham \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,\"[fn-65-P6550_1692204:588-nf] and Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of His roots; and there shall rest upon Him[fn-65-P6551_1692364:589-nf] the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-65-P6552_1692772:590-nf] And a little further on \"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek; and His rest shall be glorious.\"[fn-65-P6553_1693018:591-nf] ","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_27_book_i_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Until, then, this remission of sins takes place in the offspring, they have within them the law of sin in such manner, that it is really imputed to them as sin; in other words, with that law there is attaching to them its sentence of guilt, which holds them debtors to eternal condemnation.

For, that he was born in the flesh, although no hindrance after the remission of his guilt to his fruit, still remains hidden, as it were, in the seed of the olive, even though, because of the remission of his sins, it in no respect injures the oil-that is, in plain language, his life which he lives, \"righteous by faith,\"[fn-40-P4060_1531283:126-nf] after Christ, whose very name comes from the oil, that is, from the anointing.[fn-40-P4061_1531381:127-nf] That, however, which in the case of a regenerate parent, as in the seed of the pure olive, is covered without any guilt, which has been remitted, is still no doubt retained in the case of his offspring, which is yet unregenerate, as in the wild olive, with all its guilt, until here also it be remitted by the self-same grace. When Adam sinned, he was changed from that pure olive, which had no such corrupt seed whence should spring the bitter issue of the wild olive, into a wild olive tree; and, inasmuch as his sinwas so great, that by it his nature became commensurately changed for the worse, he converted the entire race of man into a wild olive stock. The effect of this change we see illustrated, as has been said above, in the instance of these very trees. Whenever God's grace converts a sapling into a good olive, so that the fault of the first birth (that original sin which had been derived and contracted from the concupiscence of the flesh) is remitted, covered, and not imputed, there is still inherent in it that nature from which is born a wild olive, unless it, too, by the same grace, is by the second birth changed into a good olive.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_28_book_xxii","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Wherefore it may very well be, and it is thoroughly credible, that we shall in the future world see the material forms of the new heavens and the new earth in such a way that we shall most distinctly recognize God everywhere present and governing all things, material as well as spiritual, and shall see Him, not as now we understand the invisible things of God, by the things which are made,[fn-45-P4551_2519387:86-nf] and see Him darkly, as in a mirror, and in part, and rather by faith than by bodily vision of material appearances, but by means of the bodies we shall wear and which we shall see wherever we turn our eyes.

And whose? And by whom hidden? And by whom revealed? If it was by Marcion's god that they were hidden and revealed, it was an extremely iniquitous proceeding;[fn-62-P6296_1871034:985-nf] for nothing at all had he ever produced[fn-62-P6297_1871095:986-nf] in which anything could have been hidden-no prophecies, no parables, no visions, no evidences[fn-62-P6298_1871209:987-nf] of things, or words, or names, obscured by allegories and figures, or cloudy enigmas, but he had concealed the greatness even of himself, which he was with all his might revealing by his Christ. Now in what respect had the wise and prudent done wrong,[fn-62-P6299_1871479:988-nf] that God should be hidden from them, when their wisdom and prudence had been insufficient to come to the knowledge of Him? No way had been provided by himself,[fn-63-P6300_1871659:989-nf] by any declaration of his works, or any vestiges whereby they might become[fn-63-P6301_1871771:990-nf] wise and prudent. However, if they had even failed in any duty towards a god whom they knew not, suppose him now at last to be known still they ought not to have found a jealous god in him who is introduced as unlike the Creator. Therefore, since he had neither provided any materials in which he could have hidden anything, nor had any offenders from whom he could have hidden himself: since, again, even if he had had any, he ought not to have hidden himself from them, he will not now be himself the revealer, who was not previously the concealer; so neither will any be the Lord of heaven nor the Father of Christ but He in whom all these attributes consistently meet.[fn-63-P6302_1872465:991-nf] For He conceals by His preparatory apparatus of prophetic obscurity, the understanding of which is open to faith (for \"if ye will not believe, ye shall not understand\"[fn-63-P6303_1872665:992-nf] ); and He had offenders in those wise and prudent ones who would not seek after God, although He was to be discovered in His so many and mighty works,[fn-63-P6304_1872836:993-nf] or who rashly philosophized about Him, and thereby furnished to heretics their arts;[fn-63-P6305_1872943:994-nf] and lastly, He is a jealous God. Accordingly,[fn-63-P6306_1873005:995-nf] that which Christ thanks God for doing, He long ago[fn-63-P6307_1873073:996-nf] announced by Isaiah: \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent will I hide.\"[fn-63-P6308_1873198:997-nf] So in another passage He intimates both that He has concealed, and that He will also reveal: \"I will give unto them treasures that have been hidden, and secret ones will I discover to them.\"[fn-63-P6309_1873417:998-nf] And again: \"Who else shall scatter the tokens of ventriloquists,[fn-63-P6310_1873508:999-nf] and the devices of those who divine out of their own heart; turning wise men backward, and making their counsels foolish? \"[fn-63-P6311_1873679:1000-nf] Now, if He has designated His Christ as an enlightener of the Gentiles, saying, \"I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles; \"[fn-63-P6312_1873837:1001-nf] and if we understand these to be meant in the word babes[fn-63-P6313_1873929:1002-nf] -as having been once dwarfs in knowledge and infants in prudence, and even now also babes in their lowliness of faith-we shall of course more easily understand how He who had once hidden \"these things,\" and promised a revelation of them through Christ, was the same God as He who had now revealed them unto babes. Else, if it was Marcion's god who revealed the things which had been formerly hidden by the Creator, it follows[fn-63-P6314_1874376:1003-nf] that he did the Creator's work by setting forth His deeds.[fn-63-P6315_1874450:1004-nf] But he did it, say you, for His destruction, that he might refute them.[fn-63-P6316_1874552:1005-nf] Therefore he ought to have refuted them to those from whom the Creator had hidden them, even the wise and prudent. For if he had a kind intention in what he did, the gift of knowledge was due to those from whom the Creator had detained it, instead of the babes, to whom the Creator had grudged no gift. But after all, it is, I presume, the edification[fn-63-P6317_1874934:1006-nf] rather than the demolition[fn-63-P6318_1874986:1007-nf] of the law and the prophets which we have thus far found effected in Christ. \"All things,\" He says, \"are delivered unto me of my Father.\"[fn-63-P6319_1875148:1008-nf] You may believe Him, if He is the Christ of the Creator to whom all things belong; because the Creator has not delivered to a Son who is less than Himself all things, which He created by[fn-63-P6320_1875356:1009-nf] Him, that is to say, by His Word. If, on the contrary, he is the notorious stranger,[fn-63-P6321_1875455:1010-nf] what are the\" all things\" which have been delivered to him by the Father? Are they the Creator's? Then the things which the Father delivered to the Son are good. and the Creator is therefore good, since all His \"things\" are good; whereas he[fn-63-P6322_1875766:1011-nf] is no longer good who has invaded another's good (domains) to deliver it to his son, thus teaching robbery[fn-63-P6323_1875897:1012-nf] of another's goods. Surely he must be a most mendacious being, who had no other means of enriching his son than by helping himself to another's property! Or else,[fn-63-P6324_1876087:1013-nf] if nothing of the Creator's has been delivered to him by the Father, by what right[fn-63-P6325_1876187:1014-nf] does he claim for himself (authority over) man? Or again, if man has been delivered to him, and man alone, then man is not \"all things.\" But Scripture clearly says that a transfer of all things has been made to the Son. If, however, you should interpret this \"all\" of the whole human race, that is, all nations, then the delivery of even these to the Son is within the purpose of the Creator:[fn-63-P6326_1876600:1015-nf] \"I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.\"[fn-63-P6327_1876735:1016-nf] If, indeed, he has some things of his own, the whole of which he might give to his son, along with the man of the Creator, then show some one thing of them all, as a sample, that I may believe; lest I should have as much reason not to believe that all things belong to him, of whom I see nothing, as I have ground for believing that even the things which I see not are His, to whom belongs the universe, which I see. But \"no man knoweth who the Father is, but the Son; and who the Son is, but the Father, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.\"[fn-63-P6328_1877301:1017-nf] And so it was an unknown god that Christ preached! And other heretics, too, prop themselves up by this passage; alleging in opposition to it that the Creator was known to all, both to lsrµl by familiar intercourse, and to the Gentiles by nature. Well, how is it He Himself testifies that He was not known to lsrµl? \"But Israel doth not know me, and my people doth not consider me; \"[fn-63-P6329_1877705:1018-nf] nor to the Gentiles: \"For, behold,\" says He, \"of the nations I have no man.\"[fn-63-P6330_1877802:1019-nf] Therefore He reckoned them \"as the drop of a bucket,\"[fn-63-P6331_1877993:1020-nf] while \"Sion He left as a look-out[fn-63-P6332_1878079:1021-nf] in a vineyard.\"[fn-63-P6333_1878114:1022-nf] See, then, whether there be not here a confirmation of the prophet's word, when he rebukes that ignorance of man toward God which continued to the days of the Son of man. For it was on this account that he inserted the clause that the Father is known by him to whom the Son has revealed Him, because it was even He who was announced as set by the Father to be a light to the Gentiles, who of course required to be enlightened concerning God, as well as to Israel, even by imparting to it a fuller knowledge of God. Arguments, therefore, will be of no use for belief in the rival god which may be suitable[fn-63-P6334_1878770:1023-nf] for the Creator, because it is only such as are unfit for the Creator which will be able to advance belief in His rival. If you look also into the next words, \"Blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see, for I tell you that prophets have not seen the things which ye see,\"[fn-63-P6335_1879087:1024-nf] you will find that they follow from the sense above, that no man indeed had come to the knowledge of God as he ought to have done,[fn-63-P6336_1879242:1025-nf] since even the prophets had not seen the things which were being seen under Christ. Now if He had not been my Christ, He would not have made any mention of the prophets in this passage. For what was there to wonder at, if they had not seen the things of a god who had been unknown to them, and was only revealed a long time after them? What blessedness, however, could theirs have been, who were then seeing what others were naturally[fn-63-P6337_1879697:1026-nf] unable to see, since it was of things which they had never predicted that they had not obtained the sight;[fn-63-P6338_1879821:1027-nf] if it were not because they might justly[fn-63-P6339_1879890:1028-nf] have seen the things pertaining to their God, which they had even predicted, but which they at the same time[fn-63-P6340_1880015:1029-nf] had not seen? This, however, will be the blessedness of others, even of such as were seeing the things which others had only foretold. We shall by and by show, nay, we have already shown, that in Christ those things were seen which had been foretold, but yet had been hidden from the very prophets who foretold them, in order that they might be hidden also from the wise and the prudent. In the true Gospel, a certain doctor of the law comes to the Lord and asks, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life? \"In the heretical gospel life only is mentioned, without the attribute eternal; so that the lawyer seems to have consulted Christ simply about the life which the Creator in the law promises to prolong,[fn-63-P6341_1880740:1030-nf] and the Lord to have therefore answered him according to the law, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,\"[fn-63-P6342_1880948:1031-nf] since the question was concerning the conditions of mere life. But the lawyer of course knew very well in what way the life which the law meant[fn-63-P6343_1881113:1032-nf] was to be obtained, so that his question could have had no relation to the life whose rules he was himself in the habit of teaching. But seeing that even the dead were now raised by Christ, and being himself excited to the hope of an eternal life by these examples of a restored[fn-63-P6344_1881410:1033-nf] one, he would lose no more time in merely looking on (at the wonderful things which had made him) so high in hope.[fn-63-P6345_1881544:1034-nf] He therefore consulted him about the attainment of eternal life. Accordingly, the Lord, being Himself the same,[fn-63-P6346_1881751:1035-nf] and introducing no new precept other than that which relates above all others[fn-63-P6347_1881849:1036-nf] to (man's) entire salvation, even including the present and the future life,[fn-63-P6348_1881950:1037-nf] places before him[fn-63-P6349_1881996:1038-nf] the very essence[fn-63-P6350_1882034:1039-nf] of the law-that he should in every possible way love the Lord his God. If, indeed, it were only about a lengthened life, such as is at the Creator's disposal, that he inquired and Christ answered, and not about the eternal life, which is at the disposal of Marcion's god, how is he to obtain the eternal one? Surely not in the same manner as the prolonged life. For in proportion to the difference of the reward must be supposed to be also the diversity of the services. Therefore your disciple, Marcion,[fn-63-P6351_1882555:1040-nf] will not obtain his eternal life in consequence of loving your God, in the same way as the man who loves the Creator will secure the lengthened life. But how happens it that, if He is to be loved who promises the prolonged I life, He is not much more to be loved who offers the eternal life? Therefore both one and the other life will be at the disposal of one and the same Lord; because one and the same discipline is to be followed[fn-63-P6352_1883019:1041-nf] for one and the other life. What the Creator teaches to be loved, that must He necessarily maintain[fn-63-P6353_1883138:1042-nf] also by Christ,[fn-63-P6354_1883173:1043-nf] for that rule holds good here, which prescribes that greater things ought to be believed of Him who has first lesser proofs to show, than of him for whom no preceding smaller presumptions have secured a claim to be believed in things of higher import. It matters not[fn-63-P6355_1883511:1044-nf] then, whether the word eternal has been interpolated by us.[fn-63-P6356_1883589:1045-nf] It is enough for me, that the Christ who invited men to the eternal-not the lengthened-life, when consuited about the temporal life which he was destroying, did not choose to exhort the man rather to that eternal life which he was introducing. Pray, what would the Creator's Christ have done. if He who had made man for loving the Creator did not belong to the Creator? I suppose He would have said that the Creator was not to be loved!","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_28_book_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"2.

Even in that ancient people, the holy patriarchs and prophets, who understood the part they performed, or which they were instrumental in performing, had this hope of eternal life in the New Testament.

He says, \"That children, however, who are conceived in wedlock are by nature good, we may learn from the apostle's words, when he speaks of men who, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust, men with men working together that which is disgraceful.[fn-42-P4271_1615766:80-nf] Here,\" says he, \"the apostle shows the use of the woman to be both natural and, in its way, laudable; the abuse consisting in the exerciseof one's own will in opposition to the decent use of the institution. Deservedly then,\" says he, \"in those who make a right use thereof, concupiscence is commended in its kind and mode; whilst the excess of it, in which abandoned persons indulge, is punished. Indeed, at the very time when God punished the abuse in Sodom with His judgment of fire, He invigorated the generative powers of Abraham and Sarah, which had become impotent through old age.[fn-42-P4272_1616372:81-nf] If, therefore,\" he goes on to say, \"you think that fault must be found with the strength of the generative organs, because the Sodomites were steeped in sin thereby, you will have also to censure such created things as bread and wine, since Holy Scripture informs us that they sinned also in the abuse of these gifts. For the Lord, by the mouth of His prophet Ezekiel, says: `These, moreover, were the sins of thy sister Sodom; in their pride, she and her children overflowed in fulness of bread and abundance of wine; and they helped not the hand of the poor and needy.'[fn-42-P4273_1616979:82-nf] Choose, therefore,\" says he, \"which alternative you would rather have: either impute to the work of God the sexual connection of human bodies, or account such created things as bread and wine to be equally evil. But if you should prefer this latter conclusion, you prove yourself to be a Manichean. The truth, however, is this: he who observes moderation in natural concupiscence uses a good thing well; but he who does not observe moderation, abuses a good thing. What means your statement, then,\"[fn-42-P4274_1617498:83-nf] he asks, \"when you say that `the good of marriage is no more impeachable on account of the original sin which is derived herefrom, than the evil of adultery and fornication can be excused because of the natural good which is born of them'? In these words,\" says he, \"you conceded what you had denied, and what you had conceded you nullified; and you aim at nothing so much as to be unintelligible. Show me any bodily marriage without sexual connection. Else impose some one name on this operation, and designate the conjugal union as either a good or an evil. You answer, no doubt, that you have already defined marriages to be good. Well then, if marriage is good,-if the human being is the good fruit of marriage; if this fruit, being God's work, cannot be evil, born as it is by good agency out of good,-where is the original evil which has been set aside by so many prior admissions?\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"136","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"My answer to this challenge is, that not only the children of wedlock, but also those of adultery, are a good work in so far as they are the work of God, by whom they are created: but asconcerns original sin, they are all born under condemnation of the first Adam; not only those who are born in adultery, but likewise such as are born in wedlock, unless they be regenerated in the second Adam, which is Christ.

Thus it follows, that even when a man unites with a harlot to use these members, the use is a natural one. It is not,however, commendable, but rather culpable. But as regards any part of the body which is notmeant for generative purposes, should a man use even his own wife in it, it is against nature and flagitious. Indeed, the same apostle had previously[fn-42-P4279_1619734:85-nf] said concerning women: \"Even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature;\" and then concerning men he added, that they worked that which isunseemly by leaving the natural use of the woman.

For it is not wicked, but is both beautiful and a token of the wisdom and power and lovingkindness of God. Hear at least how the prophet marvels at it, saying, \"How are thy works magnified O Lord! in wisdom Thou hast made them all.\"[fn-10-P1047_711056:4-nf] He did go through them one by one, but withdrew before the incomprehensible wisdom of God. And that he has made it thus beautiful and vast hear a certain one saying, \"From the vastness and beauty of the creatures, the originator of them is proportionably seen.\"[fn-10-P1048_711336:5-nf] Hear too Paul saying, \"For the invisible things of Him, since the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made.\"[fn-10-P1049_711513:6-nf] For each of these by which he spake declared that the creation leads us to the knowledge of God, because it causes us to know the Master fully. What then? If we see this beautiful and wondrous creation itself becoming a cause of impiety to many, shall we blame it? In no wise, but them who were unable to use the medicine rightly. Whence then is this which leads us to the knowledge of God, a cause of impiety? \"The wise\" saith he \"were darkened in their understandings, and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator\"[fn-10-P1050_712063:7-nf] The Devil is nowhere here, a Demon is nowhere here, but the creation alone is set before us, as the teacher of the knowledge of God. How then has it become the cause of impiety? Not owing to its own nature, but owing to the carelessness of those who do not take heed. What then? Shall we take away even the creation? tell me.","title":"Homily II.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_29_on_the_profit_of_believing_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"25.

Unless Christ had considered this Sabbath-which in your want of knowledge and of piety you laugh at-one of the prophecies written of Himself, He would not have borne such a testimony to it as He did. For when, as you say in praise of Christ, He suffered voluntarily, and so could choose His own time for suffering and for resurrection, He brought it about that His body rested from all its works on Sabbath in the tomb, and that His resurrection on the third day. which we call the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, and therefore the eighth, proved the circumcision of the eighth day to be also prophetical of Him. For what does circumcision mean, but the eradication of the mortality which comes from our carnal generation? So the apostle says: \"Putting off from Himself His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers, triumphing over them in Himself.\"[fn-17-P1736_979119:52-nf] The flesh here said to be put off is that mortality of flesh on account of which the body is properly called flesh. The flesh is the mortality, for in the immortality of the resurrection there will be no flesh; as it is written, \"Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\" You are accustomed to argue from these words against our faith in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, which has already taken place in the Lord Himself. You keep out of view the following words, in which the apostle explains his meaning. To show what he here means by flesh, he adds, \"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" For this body, which from its mortality is properly called flesh, is changed in the resurrection, so as to be no longer corruptible and mortal. This is the apostle's statement, and not a supposition of ours, as his next words prove. \"Lo\" he says, \"I show you a mystery: we shall all use again, but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the last trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-17-P1737_980339:53-nf] To put on immortality, the body puts off mortality. This is the mystery of circumcision, which by the law took place on the eighth day; and on the eighth day, the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, was fulfilled in its true meaning by the Lord. Hence it is said, \"Putting off His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers.\" For by means of this mortality the hostile powers of hell ruled over us. Christ is said to have made a show or example of these, because in Himself, our Head, He gave an example which will be fully realized in the liberation of His whole body, the Church, from the power of the devil at the last resurrection. This is our faith. And according to the prophetic declaration quoted by Paul, \"The just shall live by faith.\" This is our justification.[fn-17-P1738_981146:54-nf] Even Pagans believe that Christ died. But only Christians believe that Christ rose again. \"If thou confess with thy mouth,\" says the apostle, \"that Jesus is the Lord, and believest in thy heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-17-P1739_981431:55-nf] Again, because we are justified by faith in Christ's resurrection, the apostle says, \"He died for our offenses, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-17-P1740_981598:56-nf] And because this resurrection by faith in which we are justified was prefigured by the circumcision of the eighth day, the apostle says of Abraham, with whom the observance began, \"He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith.\"[fn-17-P1741_981874:57-nf] Circumcision, then, is one of the prophecies of Christ, written by Moses, of whom Christ said, \"He wrote of me.\" In the words of the Lord, \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,\"[fn-17-P1742_982214:58-nf] it is not the circumcision of the proselyte which is meant, but his imitation of the conduct of the scribes and Pharisees, which the Lord forbids His disciples to imitate, when He says: \"The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat: what they say unto you, do; but do not after their works; for they say, and do not.\"[fn-17-P1743_982554:59-nf] These words of the Lord teach us both the honor due to the teaching of Moses, in whose seat even bad men were obliged to teach good things, and the reason of the proselyte becoming a child of hell, which was not that he heard from the Pharisees the words of the law, but that he copied their example. Such a circumcised proselyte might have been addressed in the words of Paul: \"Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law.\"[fn-17-P1744_983011:60-nf] His imitation of the Pharisees in not keeping the law made him a child of hell.

But as we have already, in a way proportionate to the brevity of our discourse, spoken of the objects of the promise, and of its own stability; let us now look at this one point, as far as we are able, what it is that He was pleased to promise when He said, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am.\" As far as pertains to the creaturehood wherein He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,[fn-35-P3572_1982634:6-nf] not even He Himself was yet where He would afterwards be: but He could say in this way, \"where I am,\" to let us understand that He was soon to ascend into heaven, so that He spake of Himself as being already there, where He was presently to be. He could do so also in the same way as He had said on a former occasion, when speaking to Nicodemus, \"No man ascendeth into heaven, save He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-35-P3573_1983100:7-nf] For there also He did not say, Will be, but \"is,\" because of the oneness of person, wherein God is at once man, and man God. He promised, therefore, that we should be in heaven; for thither the servant-form, which He received of the Virgin, has been elevated, and set at the right hand of the Father. Because of the same blessed hope the apostle also says: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ; by whose grace we are saved; and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-35-P3574_1983744:8-nf] And so accordingly we may understand the Lord to have said, \"That where I am, there they may be also.\" He, indeed, said of Himself that He was there already; but of us He merely declared that He wished us to be there with Him, without any indication that we were there already But what the Lord said that He wished to be done, the apostle spake of as already accomplished. For he said not, He will yet raise us up, and make us sit in heavenly places; but, \"hath raised us up, and made us sit in heavenly places:\" for it is not without good grounds, but in believing assurance, that he reckons as already done what he is certain will yet be done. But if it is in respect of the form of God, wherein He is equal to the Father, that we would be inclined to understand His words, \"I will that they also be with me, where I am,\" let our mind get quit of every thought of material images: whateverthe soul has had presented to it, that is endowed with length, or breadth, or thickness, tinted by the light with any sort of bodily hue, or diffused through local space of any kind, whether finite or infinite, let it, as far as possible, turn away from all such notions the glance of its contemplation on the inward bent of its thoughts. And let us not be making inquiries as to where the Son, the Father's co-equal, is, since no one has yet found out where He is not. But if any one would inquire, let him inquire rather how he may be with Him; not everywhere as He is, but wherever He may be. For when He said to the man that was expiating his crimes on the tree, and making confession unto salvation, \"Today shall thou be with me in paradise,\"[fn-35-P3575_1985400:9-nf] in respect to His human nature His own soul was on that very day to be in hell,[fn-35-P3576_1985500:10-nf] His flesh in the sepulchre; but as respected His Godhead He was certainly also in paradise. And therefore the soul of the thief, absolved from his by-gone crimes, and already in the blessed enjoyment of His grace, although it could not be everywhere as He was, yet could on that very day be also with Him in paradise, from which He, who is always everywhere, had not withdrawn. On this account, doubtless, it was not enough for Him to say, \"I will that they also be where I am;\" but He added, \"with me.\" For to be with Him is the chief good. For even the miserable can be where He is, since wheresoever any are, there is He also; but the blessed only are with Him, because it is only of Him that they can be blessed. Was it not truly said to God, \"If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there; and if I go down into hell, Thou art present?\"[fn-35-P3577_1986354:11-nf] or is not Christ after all that Wisdom of God which \"penetrateth everywhere because of its purity\"?[fn-35-P3578_1986474:12-nf] But the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.[fn-35-P3579_1986567:13-nf] And similarly, to take a kind of illustration from what is visible, although greatly unlike, as the blind man, even though he be where the light is, is yet not himself with the light, but is really absent from that which is present; so the unbeliever and profane, or even the believer and pious, because not yet competent to gaze on the light of wisdom, although he cannot be anywhere that Christ is not there likewise, yet is not himself with Christ, I mean in actual sight. For we cannot doubt that the true believer is with Christ by faith; because in reference to this He saith, \"He that is not with me is against me.\"[fn-35-P3580_1987207:14-nf] But when He said to God the Father, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am,\" He spake exclusively of that sight wherein we shall see Him as He is.[fn-35-P3581_1987404:15-nf] ","title":"Tractate CXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_23_psalm_liii_liv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"5. And because the whole of this passage is the utterance of One in the form of a servant-of a servant obedient unto the death of the Cross-which He took upon Him and for which He supplicates the saving help of the Name that belongs to God, and being sure of salvation by that Name, He immediately adds: and judge Me by Thy power. For now as the reward for His humility in emptying Himself and assuming the form of a servant, in the same humility in which He had assumed it, He was asking to resume the form which He shared with God, having saved to bear the Name of God that humanity in which as God He had obediently condescended to be born. And in order to teach us that the dignity of this Name whereby He prayed to be saved is something more than an empty title, He prays to be judged by the power of God. For a right award is he essential result of judgment, as the Scripture says: Becoming obedient unto death[fn-25-P2504_1589890:5-nf] , yea, the death of the Cross. Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and gave unto Him the name which is above every name. Thus, first of all the name which is above every name is given unto Him; then next, this is a judgment of decisive force, because by the power of God, He, Who after being God had died as man, rose again from death as man to be God, as the Apostle says: He was crucified from weakness, yet He liveth by the power of God[fn-25-P2505_1590351:6-nf] , and again: For I am not ashamed of the Gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth[fn-25-P2506_1590489:7-nf] . For by the power of the Judgment human weakness is rescued to bear God's name and nature; and thus as the reward for His obedience He is exalted by the power of this judgment unto the saving protection of God's name; whence He possesses both the Name and the Power of God. Again, if the Prophet had begun this utterance in the way men generally speak, he would have asked to be judged by mercy or kindness, not by power. But judgment by power was a necessity in the case of One Who being the Son of Got was born of a virgin to be Son of Man, and Who now being Son of Man was to have the Name and power of the Son of God restored to Him by the power of judgment.","title":"Psalm LIII.

But I marvel that your piety suffered it, and that you did not stop those who said such things, and propound to them the right faith, so that upon hearing it they might hold their peace, or if they opposed it might be counted as heretics. For the statements are not fit for Christians to make or to hear, on the contrary they are in every way alien from the Apostolic teaching. For this reason, as I said above, I have caused what they say to be baldly inserted in my letter, so that one who merely hears may perceive the shame and impiety therein contained. And although it would be right to denounce and expose in full the folly of those who have had such ideas, yet it would be a good thingto close my letter here and write no more. For what is so manifestly shewn to be evil, it is not necessary to waste time in exposing further, lest contentious persons think the matter doubtful. it is enough merely to answer such things as follows: we are content with the fact that this is not the teaching of the Catholic Church, nor did the fathers hold this. But lest the `inventors of evil things[fn-100-P10035_3591068:8-nf] ' make entire silence on our part a pretext for shamelessness, it will be well to mention a few points from Holy Scripture, in case they may even thus be put to shame, and cease from these foul devices.","title":"Letter LIX.

This proves that while to all the others the Word came, in order that they might prophesy, from Mary the Word Himself took flesh, and proceeded forth as man; being by nature and essence the Word of God, but after the flesh man of the seed of David, and made of the flesh of Mary, as Paul said[fn-100-P10073_3607880:37-nf] .

If any one, however, asserts that if this was the real state of the case, Mark might have mentioned the third hour explicitly at the point at which it really was the third hour, namely, when the voices of the Jews were lifted up demanding that the Lord should be crucified; and, further, that he might have told us plainly there that those vociferators did really crucify Him at that time,-such a reasoner is simply imposing laws upon the historians of truth in his own overweening pride. For he might as well maintain that if he were himself to be a narrator of these occurrences, they ought all to be recorded just in the same way and the same order by all other writers as they have been recorded by himself. Let him therefore be content to reckon his own notion inferior to that of Mark the evangelist, who has judged it right to insert the statement just at the point at which it was suggested to him by divine inspiration. For the recollections of those historians have been ruled by the hand of Him who rules the waters, as it is written, according to His own good pleasure. For the human memory moves[fn-24-P2492_1083331:180-nf] through a variety of thoughts, and it is not in any man's power to regulate either the subject which comes into his mind or the time of its suggestion.

Now the main point of Christian orthodoxy[fn-21-P2167_1321563:6-nf] is to believe that the Only-begotten God, Who is the truth and the true light, and the power of God and the life, is truly all that He is said to be, both in other respects and especially in this, that He is God and the truth, that is to say, God in truth, ever being what He is conceived to be and what He is called, Who never at any time was not, nor ever will cease to be, Whose being, such as it is essentially, is beyond the reach of the curiosity that would try to comprehend it. But to us, as saith the word of Wisdom,[fn-21-P2168_1322480:7-nf] He makes Himself known that He is \"by the greatness and beauty of His creatures proportionately\" to the things that are known, vouchsafing to us the gift of faith by the operations of His hands, but not the comprehension of what He is. Whereas, then, such is the opinion prevailing among all Christians, (such at least as are truly worthy of the appellation, those, I mean, who have been taught by the law to worship nothing that is not very God, and by that very act of worship confess that the Only-begotten is God in truth, and not a God falsely so called,) there arose this deadly blight of the Church, bringing barrenness on the holy seeds of the faith, advocating as it does the errors of Judaism, and partaking to a certain extent in the impiety of the Greeks. For in its figment of a created God it advocates the error of the Greeks, and in not accepting the Son it supports that of the Jews. This school, then, which would do away with the very Godhead of the Lord and teach men to conceive of Him as a created being, and not that which the Father is in essence and power and dignity, since these misty ideas find no support when exposed on all sides to the light of truth, have overlooked all those names supplied by Scripture for the glorification of God, and predicated in like manner of the Father and of the Son, and have betaken themselves to the word \"ungenerate,\" a term fabricated by themselves to throw contempt on the greatness of the Only-begotten God. For whereas an orthodox confession teaches us to believe in the Only-begotten God so that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father, these men, rejecting the orthodox terms whereby the greatness of the Son is signified as on a par with the dignity of the Father, draw from thence the beginnings and foundations of their heresy in regard to His Divinity. For as the Only-begotten God, as the voice of the Gospel teaches, came forth from the Father and is of Him, misrepresenting this doctrine by a change of terms, they make use of them to rend the true faith in pieces. For whereas the truth teaches that the Father is from no pre-existing cause, these men have given to such a view the name of \"ungeneracy,\" and signify the substance of the Only-begotten from the Father by the term \"generation,\"-then comparing the two terms \"ungenerate\" and \"generate\" as contradictories to each other, they make use of the opposition to mislead their senseless followers. For, to make the matter clearer by an illustration, the expressions, He was generated and He was not generated, are much the same as, He is seated and He is not seated, and all such-like expressions. But they, forcing these expressions away from the natural significance of the terms, are eager to put another meaning upon them with a view to the subversion of orthodoxy. For whereas, as has been said, the words \"is seated\" and \"is not seated\" are not equivalent in meaning (the one expression being contradictory of the other), they pretend that this formal contradiction in expression indicates an essential difference, ascribing generation to the Son and non-generation to the Father as their essential attributes. Yet, as it is impossible to regard a man's sitting down or not as the essence of the man (for one would not use the same definition for a man's sitting as for the man himself), so, by the analogy of the above example, the non-generated essence is in its inherent idea something wholly different from the thing expressed by \"not having been generated.\" But our opponents, with an eye to their evil object, that of establishing their denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten, do not say that the essence of the Father is ungenerate, but, conversely, they declare ungeneracy to be His essence, in order that by this distinction in regard to generation they may establish, by the verbal opposition, a diversity of natures. In the direction of impiety they look with ten thousand eyes, but with regard to the impracticability of their own contention they are as incapable of vision as men who deliberately close their eyes. For who but one whose mental optics are utterly purblind can fail to discern the loose and unsubstantial character of the principle of their doctrine, and that their argument in support of ungeneracy as an essence has nothing to stand upon? For this is the way in which their error would establish itself.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"What, then, do we think of this passage? For it may be that, if we understand it, we shall also understand the meaning of Moses. It often happens that Holy Scripture, to enable us more clearly to comprehend a matter to be revealed, makes use of a bodily illustration, as would seem to be the case in this passage from David, who teaches us by what he says that none of the things which are have their being from chance or accident, as some have imagined that our world and all that is therein was framed by fortuitous and undesigned combinations of first elements, and that no Providence penetrated the world. But we are taught that there is a cause of the system and government of the Universe, on Whom all nature depends, to Whom it owes its origin and cause, towards Whom it inclines and moves, and in Whom it abides. And since, as saith the Apostle, His eternal power and godhead are understood, being clearly seen through the creation of the world[fn-22-P2247_1442007:43-nf] , therefore all creation and, before all, as saith the Scripture, the system of the heavens, declare the wisdom of the Creator in the skill displayed by His works. And this is. what it seems to me that he is desirous to set forth, viz. the testimony of the things which do appear to the fact that the worlds were framed with wisdom and skill, and abide for ever by the power of Him who is the Ruler over all. The very heavens, he says, in displaying the wisdom of Him Who made them, all but shout aloud with a voice, and, though without voice, proclaim the wisdom of their Creator. For we can hear as it were words teaching us: \"O men, when ye gaze upon us and behold our beauty and magnitude, and this ceaseless revolution, with its well-ordered and harmonious motion, working in the same direction and in the same manner, turn your thoughts to Him Who presides over our system, and, by aid of the beauty which you see, imagine to yourselves the beauty of the invisible Archetype. For in us there is nothing without its Lord, nothing that moves of its own proper motion: but all that appears, or that is conceivable in respect to us, depends on a Power Who is inscrutable and sublime.\" This is not given in articulate speech, but by the things which are seen, and it instils into our minds the knowledge of Divine power more than if speech proclaimed it with a voice. As, then, the heavens declare, though they do not speak, and the firmament shows God's handy-work, yet requires no voice for the purpose, and the day uttereth speech, though there is no speaking, and no one can say that Holy Scripture is in error-in like manner, since both Moses and David have one and the same Teacher, I mean the Holy Spirit, Who says that the fiat went before the creation, we are not told that God is the Creator of words, but of things made known to us by the signification of our words. For, lest we should suppose the creation to be without its Lord, and spontaneously originated, He says that it was created by the Divine Being, and that it is established in an orderly and connected system by Him. Now it would be a work of time to discuss the order of what Moses didactically records in his historical summary respecting the creation of the world. Or (if we did)[fn-22-P2248_1444284:44-nf] each second passage would serve to prove more clearly the erroneous and futile character of our adversaries' opinion.

On the contrary, they trembled, and recognised nothing less than that it was being uttered from a holy Temple.

It is a silly and unmeaning expression, which occurred to you only because you are in the habit of worshipping the sun on what you call Sunday. What you call Sunday we call the Lord's day, and on it we do not worship the sun, but the Lord's resurrection.

And so far you do the same, except that you worship only the two brightest luminaries, and not the rest of the stars, as the Gentiles did. Besides, the Gentiles gave the names of their gods to the months. In honor of Romulus, whom they believed to be the son of Mars, they dedicated the first month to Mars, and called it March. The next month, April, is named not from any god, but from the word for opening, because the buds generally open in this month. The third month is called May, in honor of Maia the mother of Mercury. The fourth is called June, from Juno. The rest to December used to be named according to their number The fifth and sixth, however, got the names of July and August from men to whom divine honors were decreed; while the others, from September to December, continued to be named from their number. January, again, is named from Janus, and February from the rites of the Luperci called Februae. Must we say that you worship the god Mars in the month of March? But that is the month in which you hold the feast you call Bema with great pomp. But if you think it allowable to observe the month of March without thinking of Mars, why do you try to bring in the name of Saturn in connection with the rest of the seventh day enjoined in Scripture, merely because the Gentiles call the day Saturday?

To use, on the other hand, is to employ whatever means are at one's disposal to obtain what one desires, if it is a proper object of desire; for an unlawful use ought rather to be called an abuse. Suppose, then, we were wanderers in a strange country, and could not live happily away from our fatherland, and that we felt wretched in our wandering, and wishing to put an end to our misery, determined to return home.

But he allows, as matter of \"pardon,\" that sexual intercourse, which takes place through incontinence, not alone for the begetting of children, and, at times, not at all for the begetting of children; and it is not that marriage forces this to take place, but that it procures pardon for it; provided however it be not so in excess as to hinder what ought to be set aside as seasons of prayer, nor be changed into that use which is against nature, on which the Apostle could not be silent, when speaking of the excessive corruptions of unclean and impious men. For necessary sexual intercourse for begetting is free from blame, and itself is alone worthy of marriage. But that which goes beyond this necessity, no longer follows reason, but lust.[fn-37-P3787_1790810:36-nf] And yet it pertains to the character of marriage, not to exact this, but to yield it to the partner, lest by fornication the other sin damnably. But, if both are set under such lust, they do what is plainly not matter of marriage. However, if in their intercourse they love what is honest more than what is dishonest, that is, what is matter of marriage more than what is not matter of marriage, this is allowed to them on the authority of the Apostle as matter of pardon: and for thisfault, they have in their marriage, not what sets them on to commit it, but what entreats pardon for it, if they turn not away from them the mercy of God, either by not abstaining on certain days, that they may be free to pray, and through this abstinence, as through fasting, may commend their prayers; or by changing the natural use into that which is against nature, which is more damnable when it is done in the case of husband or wife.","title":"On the Good of Marriage.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Since my little work is approaching its termination,[fn-77-P7777_2219354:594-nf] I must treat but briefly the points which still occur, whilst those which have so often turned up must be put aside. I regret still to have to contend about the law-after I have so often proved that its replacement (by the gospel)[fn-77-P7778_2219605:595-nf] affords no argument for another god, predicted as it was indeed in Christ, and in the Creator's own plans[fn-77-P7779_2219732:596-nf] ordained for His Christ. (But I must revert to that discussion) so far as (the apostle leads me, for) this very epistle looks very much as if it abrogated[fn-77-P7780_2219910:597-nf] the law. We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; area in the Avenger, the Creator. And so in the passage where he says: \"I am not ashamed of the gospel (of Christ): for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that beheveth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\"[fn-77-P7781_2220372:598-nf] he undoubtedly ascribes both the gospel and salvation to Him whom (in accordance with our heretic's own distinction) I have called the just God, not the good one. It is He who removes (men) from confidence in the law to faith in the gospel-that is to say,[fn-77-P7782_2220651:599-nf] His own law and His own gospel. When, again, he declares that \"the wrath (of God) is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,\"[fn-77-P7783_2220864:600-nf] (I ask) the wrath of what God? Of the Creator certainly. The truth, therefore, will be His, whose is also the wrath, which has to be revealed to avenge the truth. Likewise, when adding, \"We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth,\"[fn-77-P7784_2221131:601-nf] he both vindicated that wrath from which comes this judgment for the truth, and at the same time afforded another proof that the truth emanates from the same God whose wrath he attested, by witnessing to His judgment. Marcion's averment is quite a different matter, that[fn-77-P7785_2221421:602-nf] the Creator in anger avenges Himself on the truth of the rival god which had been detained in unrighteousness. But what serious gaps Marcion has made in this epistle especially, by withdrawing whole passages at his will, will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy.[fn-77-P7786_2221720:603-nf] It is enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased, strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness. If, then, God will judge the secrets of men-both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things contained in the law)[fn-77-P7787_2222134:604-nf] -surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the law, and that nature which is the rule[fn-77-P7788_2222258:605-nf] to them who know not the law. But how will He conduct this judgment? \"According to my gospel,\" says (the apostle), \"by (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7789_2222457:606-nf] So that both the gospel and Christ must be His, to whom appertain the law and the nature which are to be vindicated by the gospel and Christ-even at that judgment of God which, as he previously said, was to be according to truth.[fn-77-P7790_2222707:607-nf] The wrath, therefore, which is to vindicate truth, can only be revealed from heaven by the God of wrath;[fn-77-P7791_2222831:608-nf] so that this sentence, which is quite in accordance with that previous one wherein the judgment is declared to be the Creator's,[fn-77-P7792_2222979:609-nf] cannot possibly be ascribed to another god who is not a judge, and is incapable of wrath. It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect. even the gospel and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.[fn-77-P7793_2223503:610-nf] (This invective he utters) in perfect homage[fn-77-P7794_2223568:611-nf] to the law of God, not as if he meant to ten sure the Creator Himself with having commanded[fn-77-P7795_2223676:612-nf] a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,[fn-77-P7796_2223825:613-nf] -adopting such methods as they are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also. Are we then to suppose[fn-77-P7797_2224006:614-nf] that the apostle abstained through fear from openly calumniating God, from whom notwithstanding He did not hesitate to withdraw men? Well, but he had gone so far in his censure of the Jews, as to point against them the denunciation of the prophet, \"Through you the name of God is blasphemed (among the Gentiles).\"[fn-77-P7798_2224347:615-nf] But how absurd, that he should himself blaspheme Him for blaspheming whom he upbraids them as evil-doers! He prefers even circumcision of heart to neglect of it in the flesh. Now it is quite within the purpose of the God of the law that circumcision should be that of the heart, not in the flesh; in the spirit, and not in the letter.[fn-77-P7799_2224703:616-nf] Since this is the circumcision recommended by Jeremiah: \"Circumcise (yourselves to the Lord, and take away) the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-78-P7800_2224862:617-nf] and even of Moses: \"Circumcise, therefore, the hardness of your heart,\"[fn-78-P7801_2224953:618-nf] -the Spirit which circumcises the heart will proceed from Him who prescribed the letter also which clips[fn-78-P7802_2225086:619-nf] the flesh; and \"the Jew which is one inwardly\" will be a subject of the self-same God as he also is who is \"a Jew outwardly; \"[fn-78-P7803_2225228:620-nf] because the apostle would have preferred not to have mentioned a Jew at all, unless he were a servant of the God of the Jews. It was once[fn-78-P7804_2225386:621-nf] the law; now it is \"the righteousness of God which is by the faith of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-78-P7805_2225486:622-nf] What means this distinction? Has your god been subserving the interests of the Creator's dispensation, by affording time to Him and to His law? Is the \"Now\" in the hands of Him to whom belonged the \"Then\"? Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature? Now, as peace is only possible towards Him with whom there once was war, we shall be both justified by Him, and to Him also will belong the Christ, in whom we are justified by faith, and through whom alone God's[fn-78-P7808_2227426:625-nf] enemies can ever be reduced to peace. \"Moreover,\" says he, \"the law entered, that the offence might abound.\"[fn-78-P7809_2227548:626-nf] And wherefore this? \"In order,\" he says, \"that (where sin abounded), grace might much more abound.\"[fn-78-P7810_2227667:627-nf] Whose grace, if not of that God from whom also came the law? Unless it be, forsooth, that[fn-78-P7811_2227776:628-nf] the Creator intercalated His law for the mere purpose of[fn-78-P7812_2227871:629-nf] producing some employment for the grace of a rival god, an enemy to Himself (I had almost said, a god unknown to Him), \"that as sin had\" in His own dispensation[fn-78-P7813_2228048:630-nf] \"reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto (eternal) life by Jesus Christ,\"[fn-78-P7814_2228174:631-nf] His own antagonist! For this (I suppose it was, that) the law of the Creator had \"concluded all under sin,\"[fn-78-P7815_2228301:632-nf] and had brought in \"all the world as guilty (before God),\" and had \"stopped every mouth,\"[fn-78-P7816_2228412:633-nf] so that none could glory through it, in order that grace might be maintained to the glory of the Christ, not of the Creator, but of Marcion! I may here anticipate a remark about the substance of Christ, in the prospect of a question which will now turn up. For he says that \"we are dead to the law.\"[fn-78-P7817_2228733:634-nf] It may be contended that Christ's body is indeed a body, but not exactly[fn-78-P7818_2229130:635-nf] flesh. Now, whatever may be the substance, since he mentions \"the body of Christ,\"[fn-78-P7819_2229298:636-nf] whom he immediately after states to have been \"raised from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7820_2229381:637-nf] none other body can be understood than that of the flesh,[fn-78-P7821_2229459:638-nf] in respect of which the law was called (the law) of death.[fn-78-P7822_2229894:639-nf] But, behold, he bears testimony to the law, and excuses it on the ground of sin: \"What shall we say, therefore? Is the law sin? God forbid.\"[fn-78-P7823_2230110:640-nf] Fie on you, Marcion. \"God forbid!\" (See how) the apostle recoils from all impeachment of the law. I, however, have no acquaintance with sin except through the law.[fn-78-P7824_2230294:641-nf] But how high an encomium of the law (do we obtain) from this fact, that by it there comes to light the latent presence of sin![fn-78-P7825_2230560:642-nf] It was not the law, therefore, which led me astray, but \"sin, taking occasion by the commandment.\"[fn-78-P7826_2230776:643-nf] Why then do you, (O Marcion, ) impute to the God of the law what His apostle dares not impute even to the law itself?

We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; area in the Avenger, the Creator.

If, then, God will judge the secrets of men-both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things contained in the law)[fn-77-P7787_2222134:604-nf] -surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the law, and that nature which is the rule[fn-77-P7788_2222258:605-nf] to them who know not the law.

It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect. even the gospel and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.[fn-77-P7793_2223503:610-nf] (This invective he utters) in perfect homage[fn-77-P7794_2223568:611-nf] to the law of God, not as if he meant to ten sure the Creator Himself with having commanded[fn-77-P7795_2223676:612-nf] a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,[fn-77-P7796_2223825:613-nf] -adopting such methods as they are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also. Are we then to suppose[fn-77-P7797_2224006:614-nf] that the apostle abstained through fear from openly calumniating God, from whom notwithstanding He did not hesitate to withdraw men?

Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature?

In the (apostle's) phrase, \"From the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power,\"[fn-79-P7928_2258628:736-nf] he uses the words of Isaiah who for the express reason makes the self-same Lord \"arise to shake terribly the earth.\"[fn-79-P7929_2258767:737-nf] Well, but who is the man of sin, the son of perdition,\" who must first be revealed before the Lord comes; \"who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; who is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself as being God? \"[fn-79-P7930_2259085:738-nf] According indeed to our view, he is Antichrist; as it is taught us in both the ancient and the new prophecies,[fn-79-P7931_2259222:739-nf] and especially by the Apostle John, who says that \"already many false prophets are gone out into the world,\" the fore-runners of Antichrist, who deny that Christ is come in the flesh,[fn-79-P7932_2259460:740-nf] and do not acknowledge[fn-79-P7933_2259506:741-nf] Jesus (to be the Christ), meaning in God the Creator. According, however, to Marcion's view, it is really hard to know whether He might not be (after all) the Creator's Christ; because according to him He is not yet come. But whichsoever of the two it is, I want to know why he comes \"in all power, and with lying signs and wonders? \"[fn-79-P7934_2260736:742-nf] \"Because,\" he says, \"they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; for which cause God shall send them an instinct of delusion[fn-79-P7935_2260907:743-nf] (to believe a lie), that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"[fn-79-P7936_2261052:744-nf] If therefore he be Antichrist, (as we hold), and comes according to the Creator's purpose, it must be God the Creator who sends him to fasten in their error those who did not believe the truth, that they might be saved; His likewise must be the truth and the salvation, who avenges (the contempt of) them by sending error as their substitute[fn-79-P7937_2261421:745-nf] -that is, the Creator, to whom that very wrath is a fitting attribute, which deceives with a lie those who are not captivated with truth. If, however, he is not Antichrist, as we suppose (him to be) then He is the Christ of the Creator, as Marcion will have it. In this case how happens it that he[fn-79-P7938_2261744:746-nf] can suborn the Creator's Christ to avenge his truth? But should he after all agree with us, that Antichrist is here meant, I must then likewise ask how it is that he finds Satan, an angel of the Creator, necessary to his purpose? Why, too, should Antichrist be slain by Him, whilst commissioned by the Creator to execute the function[fn-79-P7939_2262255:747-nf] of inspiring men with their love of untruth? In short, it is incontestable that the emissary,[fn-79-P7940_2262379:748-nf] and the truth, and the salvation belong to Him to whom also appertain the wrath, and the jealousy,[fn-79-P7941_2262530:749-nf] and \"the sending of the strong delusion,\"[fn-79-P7942_2262590:750-nf] on those who despise and mock, as well as upon those who are ignorant of Him; and therefore even Marcion will now have to come down a step, and concede to us that his god is \"a jealous god.\" (This being then an unquestionable position, I ask) which God has the greater fight to be angry? He, as I suppose, who from the beginning of all things has given to man, as primary witnesses for the knowledge of Himself, nature in her (manifold) works, kindly providences, plagues,[fn-79-P7943_2263087:751-nf] and indications (of His divinity),[fn-79-P7944_2263198:752-nf] but who in spite of all this evidence has not been acknowledged; or he who has been brought out to view[fn-79-P7945_2263343:753-nf] once for all in one only copy of the gospel-and even that without any sure authority-which actually makes no secret of proclaiming another god? Now He who has the right of inflicting the vengeance, has also sole claim to that which occasions[fn-79-P7946_2263607:754-nf] the vengeance, I mean the Gospel; (in other words, ) both the truth and (its accompanying) salvation. The charge, that \"if any would not work, neither should he eat,\"[fn-79-P7947_2263790:755-nf] is in strict accordance with the precept of Him who ordered that \"the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn should not be muzzled.\"[fn-79-P7948_2263952:756-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_27_on_the_holy_trinity_and_of_the_godhead_of_the_holy_spirit","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But our argument in reply to this is ready and clear.

To take, for instance, this saying of the ancients, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy,\" how does Faustus make cut that this is peculiar to Moses? Does not the Apostle Paul speak of some men as hateful to God?[fn-18-P1877_1062666:44-nf] And, indeed, in connection with this saying, the Lord enjoins on us that we should imitate God. His words are: \"That ye may be the children of your Father in heaven, who maketh the sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.\"[fn-18-P1878_1062950:45-nf] In ore sense we must hate our enemies, after the example of God, to whom Paul says some men are hateful; while, at the same time, we must also love our enemies after the example of God, who makes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. If we understand this, we shall find that the Lord, in explaining to those who did not rightly understand the saying, Thou shalt hate thine enemy, made use of it to show that they should love their enemy, which was a new idea to them. It would take too long to show the consistency of the two things here. But when the Manichaeans condemn without exception the precept, Thou shall hate thine enemy, they may easily be met with the question whether their god loves the race of darkness. Or, if we should love our enemies now, because they have a part of good, should we not also hate them as having a part of evil? So even in this way it would appear that there is no opposition between the saying of ancient times, Thou shall hate thine enemy, and that of the Gospel, Love your enemies. For every wicked man should be hated as far as he is wicked; while he should be loved as a man. The vice which we rightly hate in him is to be condemned, that by its removal the human nature which we rightly love in him may be amended. This is precisely the principle we maintain, that we should hate our enemy for what is evil in him, that is, for his wickedness; while we also love our enemy for that which is good in him, that is, for his nature as a social and rational being. The difference between us and the Manichaeans is, that we prove the man to be wicked, not by nature, either his own or any other, but by his own will; whereas they think that a man is evil on account of the nature of the race of darkness, which, according to them, was an object of dread to God when he existed entire, and by which also he was partly conquered, so that he cannot be entirely set free. The intention of the Lord, then, is to correct those who, from knowing without understanding what was said by them of old time, Thou shalt hate thine enemy, hated their fellow-men instead of only hating their wickedness; and for this purpose He says, Love your enemies. Instead of destroying what is written about hatred of enemies in the law, of which He said, \"I am come not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it,\" He would have us learn, from the duty of loving our enemies, how it is possible in the case of one and the same person, both to hate him for his sin, and to love him for his nature. It is too much to expect our perverse opponents to understand this. But we can silence them, by showing that by their irrational objection they condemn their own god, of whom they cannot say that he loves the race of darkness; so that in enjoining on every one to love his enemy, they cannot quote his example. There would appear to be more love of their enemy in the race of darkness than in the god of the Manichaeans. The story is, that the race of darkness coveted the domain of light bordering on their territory, and, from a desire to possess it, formed the plan of invading it. Nor is there any sin in desiring true goodness and blessedness. For the Lord says, \"The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.\"[fn-18-P1879_1066266:46-nf] This fabulous race of darkness, then, wished to take by force the good they desired, for its beautiful and attractive appearance. But God, instead of returning the love of those who wished to possess Him, hated it so as to endeavor to annihilate them. If, therefore, the evil love the good in the desire to possess it, while the good hate the evil in fear of being defiled, I ask the Manichaeans, which of these obeys the precept of the Lord, \"Love your enemies\"? If you insist on making these precepts opposed to one another, it will follow that your god obeyed what is written in the law of Moses, \"Thou shall hate thine enemy\"; while the race of darkness obeyed what is written in the Gospel, \"Love your enemies.\" However, you have never succeeded in explaining the difference between the flies that fly in the day-time and the moths that fly at night; for both, according to you, belong to the race of darkness. How is it that one kind love the light, contrary to their nature; while the other kind avoid it, and prefer the darkness from which they sprung?

They were the parents of the Son of Man-\"He,\" theFather of His Word, and Wisdom, and Power, by whom He made all things. But if all things were made by that Wisdom, \"which reacheth from one end to another mightily, and sweetly ordereth all things,\"[fn-29-P2974_1313776:61-nf] then were they also made by the Son of God to whom He Himself as Son of Man was afterwards to be subject; and the Apostle says that He is the Son of David, \"who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-29-P2975_1314012:62-nf] But yet the Lord Himself proposes a question to the Jews, which the Apostle solves in these very words; for when he said, \"who was made of the seed of David,\" he added, \"according to the flesh,\" that it might be understood that He is not the Son of David according to His Divinity, but that the Son of God is David's Lord; for thus in another place, when He is setting forth the[fn-29-P2976_1314407:63-nf] privileges of the Jewish people, the Apostle saith, \"Whose are the fathers, of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, Who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-29-P2977_1314586:64-nf] As, \"according to the flesh,\" He is David's Son; but as being \"God over all, blessed for ever,\" He is David's Lord.

When they answered then that Christ was David's Son, Jesus said to them, \"How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My fight hand, till I put Thine enemies under Thy feet.[fn-29-P2979_1315272:66-nf] If David then in spirit call Him Lord, how is He his Son?\"[fn-29-P2980_1315347:67-nf] And the Jews could not answer Him. So we have it in the Gospel. He did not deny that He was David's Son, so that they could not understand that He was also David's Lord. For they acknowledged in Christ that which He became in time, but they did not understand in Him what He was in all eternity. Wherefore wishing to teach them His Divinity, He proposed a question touching His Humanity; as though He would say, \"You know that Christ is David's Son, answer Me, how He is also David's Lord?\" And that they might not say, \"He is not David's Lord,\" He introduced the testimony of David himself.

For this is proved by Jeremiah when he says, \"God hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by His understanding.\"[fn-87-P8770_2445851:471-nf] These are the energies by the stress of which He made this universe.[fn-87-P8771_2445940:472-nf] His glory is greater if He laboured. At length on the seventh day He rested from His works. Both one and the other were after His manner. If, on the contrary,[fn-87-P8772_2446119:473-nf] He made this world simply by appearing and approaching it, did He, on the completion of His work, cease to appear and approach it any more. Nay rather,[fn-87-P8773_2446286:474-nf] God began to appear more conspicuously and to be everywhere accessible[fn-87-P8774_2446372:475-nf] from the time when the world was made. You see, therefore, how all things consist by the operation of that God who \"made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heaven by His understanding; \"not appearing merely, nor approaching, but applying the almighty efforts of His mind, His wisdom, His power, His understanding, His word, His Spirit, His might. Now these things were not necessary to Him, if He had been perfect by simply appearing and approaching. They are, however, His \"invisible things,\" which, according to the apostle, \"are from the creation of the world clearly seen by the things that are made;[fn-87-P8775_2447054:476-nf] they are no parts of a nondescript[fn-87-P8776_2447108:477-nf] Matter, but they are the sensible[fn-87-P8777_2447162:478-nf] evidences of Himself. \"For who hath known the mind of the Lord,\"[fn-87-P8778_2447245:479-nf] of which (the apostle) exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches both of His wisdom and knowledge! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! \"[fn-87-P8779_2447428:480-nf] Now what clearer truth do these words indicate, than that all things were made out of nothing? They are incapable of being found out or investigated, except by God alone. Otherwise, if they were traceable or discoverable in Matter, they would be capable of investigation. Therefore, in as far as it has become evident that Matter had no prior existence (even from this circumstance, that it is impossible[fn-87-P8780_2447849:481-nf] for it to have had such an existence as is assigned to it), in so far is it proved that all things were made by God out of nothing. It must be admitted, however,[fn-87-P8781_2448032:482-nf] that Hermogenes, by describing for Matter a condition like his own-irregular, confused, turbulent, of a doubtful and precipate and fervid impulse-has displayed a specimen of his own art, and painted his own portrait.

Augustin replied: You often speak in your discourses of two gods, as indeed you acknowledge, though at first you denied it. And you give as a reason for thus speaking the words of the apostle: \"The god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not.\" Most of us punctuate this sentence differently, and explain it as meaning that the true God has blinded the minds of unbelievers. They put a stop after the word God, and read the following words together. Or without this punctuation you may, for the sake of exposition, change the order of the words, and read, \"In whom God has blinded the minds of unbelievers of this world,\" which gives the same sense. The act of blinding the minds of unbelievers may in one sense be ascribed to God, as the effect not of malice, but of justice. Thus Paul himself says elsewhere, \"Is God unjust, who taketh vengeance?\"[fn-19-P1975_1149563:2-nf] and again, \"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For Moses saith, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\" Observe what he adds, after asserting the undeniable truth that there is no unrighteousness with God: \"But what if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, and that He might manifest the riches of His grace towards the vessels of mercy, which He hath before prepared unto glory?\"[fn-19-P1976_1150160:3-nf] etc. Here it evidently cannot be said that it is one God who shows his wrath, and makes known his power in the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, and another God who shows his riches in the vessels of mercy. According to the apostle's doctrine, it is one and the same God who does both. Hence he says again, \"For this cause God gave them up to the lusts of their own heart, to uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves;\" and immediately after, \"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;\" and again, \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.\"[fn-19-P1977_1150830:4-nf] Here we see how the true and just God blinds the minds of unbelievers. For in all these words quoted from the apostle no other God is understood than He whose Son, sent by Him, came saying, \"For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind.\"[fn-19-P1978_1151165:5-nf] Here, again, it is plain to the minds of believers how God blinds the minds of unbelievers. For among the secret things, which contain the righteous principles of God's judgment, there is a secret which determines that the minds of some shall be blinded, and the minds of some enlightened. Regarding this, it is well said of God, \"Thy judgments are a great deep.\"[fn-19-P1979_1151545:6-nf] The apostle, in admiration of the unfathomable depth of this abyss, exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!

Whoever, then, denies that our body and its members, which the apostle so approves and extols, are the handiwork of God, you see whom he contradicts, preaching contrary to what you have received. So, instead of refuting his opinions, I may leave him to be accursed of all Christians. The apostle says, God tempered the body. Faustus says, Not God, but Hyle. Anathemas are more suitable than arguments to such contradictions. You cannot say that God is here called the God of this world. And if any one understands the passage where this expression does occur to mean that the devil blinds the minds of unbelievers, we grant that he does so by his evil suggestions, from yielding to which, men lose the light of righteousness in God's righteous retribution. This is all in accordance with sacred Scripture. The apostle himself speaks of temptation from without: \"I fear lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and purity. that is in Christ.\"[fn-19-P1994_1165246:14-nf] To the same purpose are the words. \"Evil communications corrupt good manners;\"[fn-19-P1995_1165344:15-nf] and when he speaks of a man deceiving himself, \"Whoever thinketh himself to be anything, when he is nothing, deceiveth himself;\"[fn-19-P1996_1165493:16-nf] or again, in the passage already quoted of the judgment of God, \"God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.\"[fn-19-P1997_1165661:17-nf] Similarly, in the Old Testament, after the words, \"God did not create death, nor hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living,\" we read, \"By the envy of the devil death entered into the world.\"[fn-19-P1998_1165877:18-nf] And again of death, that men may not put the blame from themselves, \"The wicked invite her with hands and voice; and thinking her a friend, they are drawn down.\"[fn-19-P1999_1166069:19-nf] Elsewhere. however, it is said, \"Good and evil, life and death, riches and poverty, are from the Lord God.\"[fn-20-P2000_1166195:20-nf] This seems perplexing to people who do not understand that, apart from the manifest judgment to follow hereafter upon every evil work, there is an actual judgment at the time; so that in one action, besides the craft of the deceiver and the wickedness of the voluntary agent, there is also the just penalty of the judge: for while the devil suggests, and man consents, God abandons. So, if you join the words, God of this world, and understand that the devil blinds unbelievers by his mischievous delusions, the meaning is not a bad one. For the word God is not used by itself, but with the qualification of this world, that is, of wicked men, who seek to prosper only in this age. In this sense the world is also called evil, where it is written, \"that He might deliver us from this present evil age.\"[fn-20-P2001_1167018:21-nf] In the same way, in the expression, \"whose god is their belly,\" it is only in connection with the word whose that the belly is called god. So also, in the Psalms, the devils would not be called gods without adding \"of the nations.\"[fn-20-P2002_1167266:22-nf] But in the passage we are now considering it is not said, The god of this world, or, Whose god is their belly, or, The gods of the nations are devils; but simply, God has tempered the body, which can be understood only of the true God, the Creator of all. There is no disparaging addition here, as in the other cases. But perhaps Faustus will say that God tempered the body, not as the maker of it, in the arrangement of its members, but by mixing His light with it. Thus Faustus would attribute to some other being than God the construction of the body, and the arrangement of its members, while God tempered the evil of the construction by the mixture of His goodness. Such are the inventions with which the Manichaeans cram feeble minds. But God, in aid of the feeble, by the mouth of the sacred writers rebukes this opinion. For we read a few verses before: \"God has placed the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased Him.\" Evidently, God is said to have tempered the body, because He has constructed it of many members, which in their union preserve the variety of their respective functions.","title":"Book XXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_19_sermon_ii_lii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"11.

It requires closer examination to see the meaning of the first action of Moses in burning the calf in fire, and grinding it to powder, and sprinkling it in the water for the people to drink. The tables given to him, written with the finger of God, that is, by the agency of the Holy Spirit, he may have broken, because he judged the people unworthy of having them read to them; and he may have burned the calf, and ground it, and scattered it so as to be carried away by the water, in order to let nothing of it remain among the people. But why should he have made them drink it? Every one must feel anxious to discover the typical significance of this action. Pursuing the inquiry, we may find that in the calf there was an embodiment of the devil, as there is in men of all nations who have the devil as their head or leader in their impious rites. The calf is gold, because there is a semblance of wisdom in the institution of idolatrous worship. Of this the apostle says, \"Knowing God, they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise they became foolish, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things.\"[fn-22-P2297_1383546:186-nf] From this so-called wisdom came the golden calf, which was one of the forms of idolatry among the chief men and professed sages of Egypt. The calf, then, represents every body or society of Gentile idolaters. This impious society the Lord Christ burns with that fire of which He says in the Gospel, \"I am come to send fire on the earth;\"[fn-22-P2298_1383906:187-nf] for, as there is nothing hid from His heat,[fn-22-P2299_1383971:188-nf] when the Gentiles believe in Him they lose the form of the devil in the fire of divine influence. Then all the body is ground, that is, after the dissolution of the combination in the membership of iniquity comes humiliation under the word of truth. Then the dust is sprinkled in the water, that the Israelites, that is, the preachers of the gospel, may in baptism admit those formerly idolaters into their own body, that is, the body of Christ. To Peter, who was one of those Israelites, it was said of the Gentiles, \"Kill, and eat.\"[fn-23-P2300_1384525:189-nf] To kill and eat is much the same as to grind and drink. So this calf, by the fire of zeal, and the keen penetration of the word, and the water of baptism, was swallowed up by the people, instead of their being swallowed up by it.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_29_the_book_concerning_the_mysteries_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"8.

For having experience of diversities of pleasures, and girt about with oblivion of things divine; being pleased moreover and having in view the passions of the body, and nothing but things present and opinions about them, ceased to think that anything existed beyond what is seen, or that anything was good save things temporal and bodily; so turning away and forgetting that she was in the image of the good God, she no longer, by the power which is in her, sees God the Word after whose likeness she is made; but having departed from herself, imagines and feigns what is not. 2. For hiding, by the complications of bodily lusts, the mirror which, as it were, is in her, by which alone she had the power of seeing the Image of the Father, she no longer sees what a soul ought to behold, but is carried about by everything, and only sees the things which come under the senses. Hence, weighted with all fleshly desire, and distracted among the impressions of these things, she imagines that the God Whom her understanding has forgotten is to be found in bodily and sensible things, giving to things seen the name of God, and glorifying only those things which she desires and which are pleasant to her eyes. 3. Accordingly, evil is the cause which brings idolatry in its train; for men, having learned to contrive evil, which is no reality in itself, in like manner feigned for themselves as gods beings that had no real existence. Just, then, as though a man had plunged into the deep, and no longer saw the light, nor what appears by light, because his eyes are turned downwards, and the water is all above him; and, perceiving only the things in the deep, thinks that nothing exists beside them, but that the things he sees are the only true realities; so the men of former time, having lost their reason, and plunged into the lusts and imaginations of carnal things, and forgotten the knowledge and glory of God, their, reasoning being dull, or rather following unreason, made gods for themselves of things seen, glorifying the creature rather than the Creator[fn-16-P1610_548138:16-nf] , and deifying the works rather than the Master, God, their Cause and Artificer. 4. But just as, according to the above simile, men who plunge into the deep, the deeper they go down, advance into darker and deeper places, so it is with mankind. For they did not keep to idolatry in a simple form, nor did they abide in that with which they began; but the longer they went on in their first condition, the more new superstitions they invented: and, not satiated with the first evils, they again filled themselves. with others, advancing further in utter shamefulness, and surpassing themselves in impiety.

And the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-64-P6461_1077104:22-nf] \"At the end of the days He spoke to us in His Son, whom He made the heir of all things, 'through whom' also He made the ages,\" showing us that God made the ages through His Son, the\" through whom\" belonging, when the ages were being made, to the Only-begotten. Thus, if all things were made, as in this passage also, through the Logos, then they were not made by the Logos, but by a stronger and greater than He. And who else could this be but the Father? Now if, as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we have to enquire if the Holy Spirit also was made through Him. it appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who also admit that \"all things were made through Him,\" must necessarily assume that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being older than He. And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to have been made through Christ must, if he admits the truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be uncreated. There is a third resource besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the Father and the Son. But on further thought one may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the Spirit and the Son in the passage,[fn-64-P6462_1078585:23-nf] \"Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man. it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come.\" We consider, therefore, that there are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; and at the same thee we believe nothing to be uncreated but the Father. We therefore, as the more pious and the truer course, admit that all things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the most excellent and the first in order[fn-64-P6463_1079161:24-nf] of all that was made by the Father through Christ. And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not said to be God's own Son. The Only-begotten only is by nature and from the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have need of the Son, to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him not only to exist, but to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that we must think of Him as being. All this He has by participation of the character of Christ, of which we have spoken above. And I consider that the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through participation in Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts, which come from God; so that the said material of the gifts is made powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence in men to the Holy Spirit. I am led to this view of the charisms by the words of Paul which he writes somewhere,[fn-64-P6464_1080100:25-nf] \"There are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, and diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God that worketh all in all.\" The statement that all things were made by Him, and its seeming corollary, that the Spirit must have been called into being by the Word, may certainly raise some difficulty. There are some passages in which the Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but also by the Holy Spirit. \"Now the Lord hath sent Me,\" He says,[fn-64-P6465_1080706:26-nf] \"and His Spirit.\" and in the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come. What is the reason of this? Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven? May it not rather be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of their sins, while only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it, and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite of such great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them. When we find the Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the Saviour, but that the Saviour takes a lower place than He in order to carry out the plan which has been made that the Son of God should become man. Should any one stumble at our saying that the Saviour in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews,[fn-64-P6466_1081998:27-nf] where Jesus is shown by Paul to have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of death. \"We behold Him,\" he says, \"who hath been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.\" And this, too, has doubtless to be added, that the creation, in order to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and not least of all the human race, required the introduction into human nature of a happy and divine power, which should set right what was wrong upon the earth, and that this action fell to the share, as it were, of the Holy Spirit; but the Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts forward the Saviour as the only one able to endure such a conflict. The Father therefore, the principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before, promising to descend, when the thee comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him for the salvation of men. This He did. when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after the baptism. He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have done with men not able continuously to bear His glory. Thus John, when explaining how he knew who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining upon him. For it is written that John said:[fn-64-P6467_1083348:28-nf] \"He who sent me to baptize said, On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\" It is not said only, \"On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending,\" for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but \"descending and abiding on Him.\" Our examination of this point has been somewhat extended, since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things were made by Him, then the Spirit also was made through the Word, and is seen to be one of the \"all things\" which are inferior to their Maker. This view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words which may be adduced to the opposite effect. If any one should lend credence to the Gospel according to the Hebrews, where the Saviour Himself says, \"My mother, the Holy Spirit took me just now by one of my hairs and carried me off to the great mount Tabor,\" he will have to face the difficulty of explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother of Christ when it was itself brought into existence through the Word. But neither the passage nor this difficulty is hard to explain. For if he who does the will of the Father in heaven[fn-64-P6468_1084554:29-nf] is Christ's brother and sister and mother, and if the name of brother of Christ may be applied, not only to the race of men, but to beings of diviner rank than they, then there is nothing absurd in the Holy Spirit's being His mother, every one being His mother who does the will of the Father in heaven.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_37_of_the_work_of_monks_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"30.

In Antioch there were (teachers) enough, and Phoenice too was near to Palestine; but Cyprus not so. However, you are not to make a question of the why and wherefore, when it is the Spirit that directs their movements: for they were not only ordained by the Spirit, but sent forth by Him likewise. \"And when they were come to Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews.\" Do you mark how they make a point of preaching the word to them first, not to make them more contentious?[fn-11-P1139_1083604:1-nf] The persons mentioned before \"spake to none but to Jews only\" (ch. xi. 19), and so here they betook them to the synagogues. \"And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus: which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.\" (v. 6-8.) Again a Jew sorcerer, as was Simon. And observe this man, how, while they preached to the others, he did not take it much amiss, but only when they approached the proconsul. And then in respect of the proconsul the wonder is, that although prepossessed by the man's sorcery, he was nevertheless willing to hear the Apostles. So it was with the Samaritans: and from the competition (sugkrisewj) the victory appears, the sorcery being worsted. Everywhere, vainglory and love of power are a (fruitful) source of evils! \"But Saul, who is also Paul,\"-(v. 9) here his name is changed at the same time that he is ordained, as it was in Peter's case,[fn-11-P1140_1085842:2-nf] -\"filled with the Holy Ghost, looked upon him, and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou child of the devil:\" (v. 10) and observe, this is not abuse, but accusation: for so ought forward, impudent people to be rebuked \"thou enemy of all righteousness;\" here he lays bare what was in the thoughts of the man, while under pretext of saving he was ruining the proconsul: \"wilt thou not cease,\" he says, \"to pervert the ways of the Lord?\" (He says it) both confidently (aciopistwj), It is not with us thou art warring, nor art thou fighting (with us), but \"the ways of the Lord\" thou art perverting, and with praise (of these, he adds) \"the right\" ways. \"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind.\" (v. 11.) It was the sign by which he was himself converted, and by this he would fain convert this man. As also that expression, \"for a season,\" puts it not as an act of punishing, but as meant for his conversion: had it been for punishment, he would have made him lastingly blind, but now it is not so, but \"for a season\" (and this), that he may gain the proconsul. For, as he was prepossessed by the sorcery, it was well to teach him a lesson by this infliction (and the sorcerer also), in the same way as the magicians (in Egypt) were taught by the boils.[fn-11-P1141_1088059:3-nf] (Ex. ix. 11.) \"And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness: add he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.\" (v. 12.) But observe, how they do not linger there, as (they might have been tempted to do) now that the proconsul was a believer, nor are enervated by being courted and honored, but immediately keep on with their work, and set out for the country on the opposite coast. \"Now when Paul and his company loosed froth Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.\" (v. 13, 14.) And here again they entered the synagogues, in the character of Jews, that they might not be treated as enemies, and be driven away: and in this way they carried the whole matter successfully. \"And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.\" (v. 15.) From this point, we learn the history of Paul's doings, as in what was said above we have learned not a little about Peter.

The Apostles are not unaware that in some things they give offence, and that in some respects their culture is defective, and they confess themselves[fn-66-P6641_1160077:2-nf] accordingly to be rude in speech but not in knowledge; for we must consider that the other Apostles would have said this, too, as well as Paul.

For he was made sufficient[fn-66-P6645_1161352:6-nf] by God to be a minister of the New Covenant, wielding the demonstration of the spirit and of power, so that when the believers agreed with him their belief should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. For, perhaps, if the Scripture possessed, like the works the Greeks admire, elegance and command of diction, then it would be open to suppose that not the truth of them had laid hold of men, but that the apparent sequence and splendour of language had carried off the hearers, and had carried them off by guile.","title":"Fragments of the Fourth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_38_on_patience","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"16.

For if the earth has to suffer either joy or injury, it is simply on man's account, that he may suffer the joy or the sorrow through the events which happen to his dwelling-place, whereby he will rather have to pay the penalty which, simply on his account, even the earth must suffer. When, therefore, God even threatens the earth, I would prefer saying that He threatens the flesh: so likewise, when He makes a promise to the earth, I would rather understand Him as promising the flesh; as in that passage of David: \"The Lord is King, let the earth be glad,\"[fn-99-P9938_2746965:181-nf] -meaning the flesh of the saints, to which appertains the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. Then he afterwards says: \"The earth saw and trembled; the mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord,\"-meaning, no doubt the flesh of the wicked; and (in a similar sense) it is written: \"For they shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-99-P9939_2747322:182-nf] If indeed it will be thought that both these passages were pronounced simply of the element earth, how can it be consistent that it should shake and melt at the presence of the Lord, at whose royal dignity it before exulted? So again in Isaiah, \"Ye shall eat the good of the land,\"[fn-99-P9940_2747626:183-nf] the expression means the blessings which await the flesh when in the kingdom of God it shall be renewed, and made like the angels, and waiting to obtain the things \"which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, and which have not entered into the heart of man.\"[fn-99-P9941_2747905:184-nf] Otherwise, how vain that God should invite men to obedience by the fruits of the field and the elements of this life, when He dispenses these to even irreligious men and blasphemers; on a general condition once for all made to man, \"sending rain on the good and on the evil, and making His sun to shine on the just and on the unjust!\"[fn-99-P9942_2748261:185-nf] Happy, no doubt, is faith, if it is to obtain gifts which the enemies of God and Christ not only use, but even abuse, \"worshipping the creature itself in opposition to the Creator!\"[fn-99-P9943_2748463:186-nf] You will reckon, (I suppose) onions and truffles among earth's bounties, since the Lord declares that \"man shall not live on bread alone!\"[fn-99-P9944_2748621:187-nf] In this way the Jews lose heavenly blessings, by confining their hopes to earthly ones, being ignorant of the promise of heavenly bread, and of the oil of God's unction, and the wine of the Spirit, and of that water of life which has its vigour from the vine of Christ. On exactly the same principle, they consider the special soil of Judµa to be that very holy land, which ought rather to be interpreted of the Lord's flesh, which, in all those who put on Christ, is thenceforward the holy land; holy indeed by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, truly flowing with milk and honey by the sweetness of His assurance, truly Judµan by reason of the friendship of God. For \"he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, but he who is one inwardly.\"[fn-99-P9945_2749379:188-nf] In the same way it is that both God's temple and Jerusalem (must be understood) when it is said by Isaiah: \"Awake, awake, O Jerusalem! put on the strength of thine arm; awake, as in thine earliest time,\"[fn-99-P9946_2749607:189-nf] that is to say, in that innocence which preceded the fall into sin.

Neither indeed is salvation promised to any one land at all, which must needs pass away with the fashion of the whole world. Even if anybody should venture strongly to contend that paradise is the holy land, which it may be possible to designate as the land of our first parents Adam and Eve, it will even then follow that the restoration of paradise will seem to be promised to the flesh, whose lot it was to inhabit and keep it, in order that man may be recalled thereto just such as he was driven from it.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_36_homily_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham\"-he also calls them after their father-\" unto you was the word of this salvation sent.\" (v. 26.)

But in and through Him He reveals Himself also, as the Saviour says[fn-18-P1808_662188:37-nf] : \"I in the Father and the Father in Me:\" so that it follows that the Word is in Him that begat Him, and that He that is begotten lives eternally with the Father. But this being so, and nothing being outside Him, but both heaven and earth and all that in them is being dependent on Him, yet men in their folly have set aside the knowledge and service of Him, and honoured things that are not instead of things that are: and instead of the real and true God deified things that were not, \"serving the creature rather than the Creator[fn-18-P1809_662740:38-nf] ,\" thus involving themselves in foolishness and impiety. 3. For it is just as if one were to admire the works more than the workman, and being awestruck at the public works in the city, were to make light of their builder, or as if one were to praise a musical instrument but to despise the man who made and tuned it. Foolish and sadly disabled in eyesight! For how else had they known the building, or ship, or lyre, had not the ship-builder made it, the architect built it, or the musician fashioned it? 4. As then he that reasons in such a way is mad, and beyond all madness, even so affected in mind, I think, are those who do not recognise God or worship His Word, our Lord Jesus Christ the Saviour of all, through Whom the Father orders, and holds together all things, and exercises providence over the Universe; having faith and piety towards Whom, my Christ-loving friend, be of good cheer and of good hope, because immortality and the kingdom of heaven is the fruit of faith and devotion towards Him, if only the soul be adorned according to His laws. For just as for them who walk after His example, the prize is life everlasting, so for those who walk the opposite way, and not that of virtue, there is great shame, and peril without pardon in the day of judgment, because although they knew the way of truth their acts were contrary to their knowledge.

We read in the book of holy Job, \"Is not the life of man upon earth a temptation?\"[fn-33-P3370_1480050:15-nf] What then do we pray for? Hear what. The Apostle James saith, \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.\"[fn-33-P3371_1480208:16-nf] He spoke of those evil temptations, whereby men are deceived, and brought under the yoke of the devil. This is the kind of temptation he spoke of. For there is another sort of temptation which is called a proving; of this kind of temptation it is written, \"The Lord your God tempteth (proveth) you to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-33-P3372_1480553:17-nf] What means \"to know\"? \"To make you know,\" for He knoweth already. With that kind of temptation, whereby we are deceived and seduced, God tempteth no man. But undoubtedly in His deep and hidden judgment He abandons some. And when He hath abandoned them, the tempter finds his opportunity. For he finds in him no resistance against his power, but forthwith presents himself to him as his possessor, if God abandon him. Therefore that He may not abandon us, do we say, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" \"For every one is tempted,\" says the same Apostle James, \"when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed. Then lust, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.\"[fn-33-P3373_1481288:18-nf] What then has he hereby taught us? To fight against our lusts. For ye are about to put away your sins in Holy Baptism; but lusts will still remain, wherewith ye must fight after that ye are regenerate. For a conflict with your own selves still remains. Let no enemy from without be feared: conquer thine own self, and the whole world is conquered. What can any tempter from without, whether the devil or the devil's minister, do against thee? Whosoever sets the hope of gain before thee to seduce thee, let him only find no covetousness in thee; and what can he who would tempt thee by gain effect? Whereas if covetousness be found in thee, thou takest fire at the sight of gain, and art taken by the bait of this corrupt food.[fn-33-P3374_1482037:19-nf] But if he find no covetousness in thee, the trap remains spread in vain. Or should the tempter set before thee some woman of surpassing beauty; if chastity be within, iniquity from without is overcome. Therefore that he may not take thee with the bait of a strange woman's beauty, fight with thine own lust within; thou hast no sensible perception of thine enemy, but of thine own concupiscence thou hast. Thou dost not see the devil, but the object that engageth thee thou dost see. Get the mastery then over that of which thou art sensible within. Fight valiantly, for He who hath regenerated thee is thy Judge; He hath arranged the lists, He is making ready the crown. But because thou wilt without doubt be conquered, if thou have not Him to aid thee, if He abandon thee: therefore dost thou say in the prayer, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" The Judge's wrath hath given over some to their own lusts; and the Apostle says, \"God gave them over to the lusts of their hearts.\"[fn-33-P3375_1483043:20-nf] How did He give them up?

If you are so venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the better and more deliberately, listen to the psalm in which Two are described as God: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee or made Thee His Christ.\"[fn-105-P10556_2961814:140-nf] Now, since He here speaks to God, and affirms that God is anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two are God, by reason of the sceptre's royal power. Accordingly, Isaiah also says to the Person of Christ: \"The Sabµans, men of stature, shall pass over to Thee; and they shall follow after Thee, bound in fetters; and they shall worship Thee, because God is in Thee: for Thou art our God, yet we knew it not; Thou art the God of Israel.\"[fn-105-P10557_2962277:141-nf] For here too, by saying, \"God is in Thee, and \"Thou art God,\" he sets forth Two who were God: (in the former expression in Thee, he means) in Christ, and (in the other he means) the Holy Ghost. That is a still grander statement which you will find expressly made in the Gospel: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-105-P10558_2962669:142-nf] There was One \"who was,\" and there was another \"with whom\" He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-105-P10559_2962876:143-nf] And Isaiah says this: \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? \"[fn-105-P10560_2963000:144-nf] Now he would most certainly have said Thine Arm, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-105-P10561_2963315:145-nf] Now, either deny that this is Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you are, that you do not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories and parables, but in determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed, you follow those who did not at the time endure the Lord when showing Himself to be the Son of God, because they would not believe Him to be the Lord, then (I ask you)call to mind along with them the passage where it is written, \"I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are children of the Most High; \"[fn-105-P10562_2963944:146-nf] and again, \"God standeth in the congregation of gods; \"[fn-105-P10563_2964022:147-nf] in order that, if the Scripture has not been afraid to designate as gods human beings, who have become sons of God by faith, you may be sure that the same Scripture has with greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord on the true and one-only Son of God. Very well! you say, I shall challenge you to preach from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same Scriptures) two Gods and two Lords, consistently with your views. God forbid, (is my reply.) For we, who by the grace of God possess an insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings, especially we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of human teachers, do indeed definitively declare that Two Beings are God, the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy Spirit, even Three, according to the principle of the divine economy, which introduces number, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself believed to have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and each is God; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the Scriptures but one Personality of Him who is God and Lord, Christ would justly enough be inadmissible to the title of God and Lord: for (in the Scriptures) there was declared to be none other than One God and One Lord, and it must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down (to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in the Scriptures), and His entire Economy would be involved in obscurity, which has been planned and arranged with so clear a foresight in His providential dispensation as matter for our faith. As soon, however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who had from the beginning[fn-105-P10564_2966241:148-nf] caused plurality[fn-105-P10565_2966272:149-nf] (in the Divine Economy), being the second from the Father, and with the Spirit the third, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more fully (than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was at once restored to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the Gentiles would have to pass from the multitude of their idols to the One Only God, in order that a difference might be distinctly settled between the worshippers of One God and the votaries of polytheism. For it was only right that Christians should shine in the world as \"children of light,\" adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as \"the light of the world.\" Besides, if, from that perfect knowledge[fn-105-P10566_2966998:150-nf] which assures us that the title of God and Lord is suitable both to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, we were to invoke a plurality of gods and lords, we should quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure the martyr's sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open to us, as soon as we swore by a plurality of gods and lords, as sundry heretics do, who hold more gods than One. I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father \"God,\" and invoke Jesus Christ as \"Lord.\"[fn-105-P10567_2967668:151-nf] But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to call Him \"God,\" as the same apostle says: \"Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-105-P10568_2967845:152-nf] For I should give the name of\" sun\" even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make not two suns, still I shall reckon both the sun and its ray to be as much two things and two forms[fn-105-P10569_2968195:153-nf] of one undivided substance, as God and His Word, as the Father and the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But why should I linger over matters which are so evident, when I ought to be attacking points on which they seek to obscure the plainest proof? For, confuted on all sides on the distinction between the Father and the Son, which we maintain without destroying their inseparable union-as (by the examples) of the sun and the ray, and the fountain and the river-yet, by help of (their conceit)an indivisible number, (with issues)of two and three, they endeavour to interpret this distinction in a way which shall nevertheless tally with their own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish two, Father and Son, understanding the Son to be flesh, that is man, that is Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is God, that is Christ. Thus they, while contending that the Father and the Son are one and the same, do in fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them. For if Jesus is one, and Christ is another, then the Son will be different from the Father, because the Son is Jesus, and the Father is Christ. Such a monarchy as this they learnt, I suppose, in the school of Valentinus, making two-Jesus and Christ. But this conception of theirs has been, in fact, already confuted in what we have previously advanced, because the Word of God or the Spirit of God is also called the power of the Highest, whom they make the Father; whereas these relations[fn-108-P10842_3040974:384-nf] are not themselves the same as He whose relations they are said to be, but they proceed from Him and appertain to Him. However, another refutation awaits them on this point of their heresy. See, say they, it was announced by the angel: \"Therefore that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10843_3041312:385-nf] Therefore, (they argue, ) as it was the flesh that was born, it must be the flesh that is the Son of God. Nay, (I answer, ) this is spoken concerning the Spirit of God. For it was certainly of the Holy Spirit that the virgin conceived; and that which He conceived, she brought forth. That, therefore, had to be born which was conceived and was to be brought forth; that is to say, the Spirit, whose \"name should be called Emmanuel which, being interpreted, is, God with us.\"[fn-108-P10844_3041806:386-nf] Besides, the flesh is not God, so that it could not have been said concerning it, \"That Holy Thing shall be called the Son of God,\" but only that Divine Being who was born in the flesh, of whom the psalm also says, \"Since God became man in the midst of it, and established it by the will of the Father.\"[fn-108-P10845_3042130:387-nf] Now what Divine Person was born in it? The Word, and the Spirit which became incarnate with the Word by the will of the Father. The Word, therefore, is incarnate; and this must be the point of our inquiry: How the Word became flesh,-whether it was by having been transfigured, as it were, in the flesh, or by having really clothed Himself in flesh. Certainly it was by a real clothing of Himself in flesh. For the rest, we must needs believe God to be unchangeable, and incapable of form, as being eternal. But transfiguration is the destruction of that which previously existed. For whatsoever is transfigured into some other thing ceases to be that which it had been, and begins to be that which it previously was not. God, however, neither ceases to be what He was, nor can He be any other thing than what He is. The Word is God, and \"the Word of the Lord remaineth for ever,\"-even by holding on unchangeably in His own proper form. Now, if He admits not of being transfigured, it must follow that He be understood in this sense to have become flesh, when He comes to be in the flesh, and is manifested, and is seen, and is handled by means of the flesh; since all the other points likewise require to be thus understood. For if the Word became flesh by a transfiguration and change of substance, it follows at once that Jesus must be a substance compounded of[fn-108-P10846_3043533:388-nf] two substances-of flesh and spirit,-a kind of mixture, like electrum, composed of gold and silver; and it begins to be neither gold (that is to say, spirit) nor silver (that is to say, flesh),-the one being changed by the other, and a third substance produced. Jesus, therefore, cannot at this rate be God for He has ceased to be the Word, which was made flesh; nor can He be Man incarnate for He is not properly flesh, and it was flesh which the Word became. Being compounded, therefore, of both, He actually is neither; He is rather some third substance, very different from either. But the truth is, we find that He is expressly set forth as both God and Man; the very psalm which we have quoted intimating (of the flesh), that \"God became Man in the midst of it, He therefore established it by the will of the Father,\"-certainly in all respects as the Son of God and the Son of Man, being God and Man, differing no doubt according to each substance in its own especial property, inasmuch as the Word is nothing else but God, and the flesh nothing else but Man. Thus does the apostle also teach respecting His two substances, saying, \"who was made of the seed of David; \"[fn-108-P10847_3044719:389-nf] in which words He will be Man and Son of Man. \"Who was declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit; \"[fn-108-P10848_3044850:390-nf] in which words He will be God, and the Word-the Son of God. We see plainly the twofold state, which is not confounded, but conjoined in One Person-Jesus, God and Man. Concerning Christ, indeed, I defer what I have to say.[fn-108-P10849_3045087:391-nf] (I remark here), that the property of each nature is so wholly preserved, that the Spirit[fn-108-P10850_3045202:392-nf] on the one hand did all things in Jesus suitable to Itself, such as miracles, and mighty deeds, and wonders; and the Flesh, on the other hand, exhibited the affections which belong to it. It was hungry under the devil's temptation, thirsty with the Samaritan woman, wept over Lazarus, was troubled even unto death, and at last actually died. If, however, it was only a tertium quid, some composite essence formed out of the Two substances, like the electrum (which we have mentioned), there would be no distinct proofs apparent of either nature. But by a transfer of functions, the Spirit would have done things to be done by the Flesh, and the Flesh such as are effected by the Spirit; or else such things as are suited neither to the Flesh nor to the Spirit, but confusedly of some third character. Nay more, on this supposition, either the Word underwent death, or the flesh did not die, if so be the Word was converted into flesh; because either the flesh was immortal, or the Word was modal. Forasmuch, however, as the two substances acted distinctly, each in its own character, there necessarily accrued to them severally their own operations, and their own issues. Learn then, together with Nicodemus, that \"that which is born in the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.\"[fn-108-P10851_3046545:393-nf] Neither the flesh becomes Spirit, nor the Spirit flesh. In one Person they no doubt are well able to be co-existent. Of them Jesus consists-Man. of the flesh; of the Spirit, God-and the angel designated Him as \"the Son of God,\"[fn-108-P10852_3046793:394-nf] in respect of that nature, in which He was Spirit, reserving for the flesh the appellation \"Son of Man.\" In like manner, again, the apostle calls Him \"the Mediator between God and Men,\"[fn-108-P10853_3046998:395-nf] and so affirmed His participation of both substances. Now, to end the matter, will you, who interpret the Son of God to be flesh, be so good as as to show us what the Son of Man is? Will He then, I want to know, be the Spirit? But you insist upon it that the Father Himself is the Spirit, on the ground that \"God is a Spirit,\" just as if we did not read also that there is \"the Spirit of God; \"in the same manner as we find that as \"the Word was God,\" so also there is \"the Word of God.\"","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And so, most foolish heretic, you make Christ to be the Father, without once considering the actual force of this name, if indeed Christ is a name, and not rather a surname, or designation; for it signifies \"Anointed.\" But Anointed is no more a proper name than Clothed or Shod; it is only an accessory to a name. Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also called Vestitus (Clothed), as He is actually called Christ from the mystery of His anointing, would you in like manner say that Jesus was the Son of God, and at the same time suppose that Vestitus was the Father? Now then, concerning Christ, if Christ is the Father, the Father is an Anointed One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is from Himself that He receives it, then you must prove it to us. But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the Church to God, \"Of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together.\"[fn-108-P10857_3048785:396-nf] These then testified both that Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the Father, and not the Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: \"Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ,\" that is, Anointed.[fn-108-P10858_3049223:397-nf] John, moreover, brands that man as \"a liar\" who \"denieth that Jesus is the Christ; \"whilst on the other hand he declares that \"every one is born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.\"[fn-108-P10859_3049436:398-nf] Wherefore he also exhorts us to believe in the name of His (the Father's, ) Son Jesus Christ, that \"our fellowship may be with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\"[fn-108-P10860_3049653:399-nf] Paul, in like manner, everywhere speaks of \"God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.\" When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.[fn-108-P10861_3049843:400-nf] To the Galatians he declares himself to be \"an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father.\"[fn-108-P10862_3049990:401-nf] You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth Two-God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father. (They also testify) that Jesus is Himself the Christ, and under one or the other designation the Son of God. For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the Son of God, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names Jesus Christ, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the angel; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His anointing,-thussuggesting the proviso that Christ must be the Son, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is God the Father, when He says, \"I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God,\"[fn-108-P10863_3051210:402-nf] He of course shows plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another God. If, again, the Father is Christ, He must be some other Being who \"strengtheneth the thunder, and createth the wind, and declareth unto men His Christ.\"[fn-108-P10864_3051476:403-nf] And if \"the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ,\"[fn-108-P10865_3051623:404-nf] that Lord must be another Being, against whose Christ were gathered together the kings and the rulers. And if, to quote another passage, \"Thus saith the Lord to my Lord Christ,\"[fn-108-P10866_3051819:405-nf] the Lord who speaks to the Father of Christ must be a distinct Being.

With large liberality (filotimiaj) the food is given, not merely for a frugal sufficiency, nor stinted by the need. \"And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the multitudes\" (v. 18)-indeed by this very thing they gained most admiration-\"from sacrificing to them.\" Do you observe that this was the point with them to put an end to that madness? \"But there came,\" it says, \"certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium\" (v. 19).-Indeed children of the devil, that not in their own cities only, but also beyond them, they did these things, and as much made it their study to make an end of the preaching, as the Apostles were in earnest to establish it!-\"and having persuaded the multitude and stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city.\" (e) So then, the Gentiles regarded them as gods, but these \"dragged\" him, \"out of the city, supposing he had been dead. Having persuaded the multitude\"-for it is not likely that all thus reverenced them. In the very city in which they received this reverence, in the same were they thus terribly ill treated. And this also profited the beholders. \"Lest any man,\" he says, \"should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth aught from me.\" (v. 20.)-\"Howbeit as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city.\" (d) Here is fulfilled that saying, \"My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\" (2 Cor. xii. 9.) Greater this than the raising of the lame man! (f) \"Came into the city.\" Do you mark the zeal, do you mark how fervent he[fn-12-P1234_1186476:7-nf] is, how set on fire! He came into the city itself again: for proof that if on any occasion he did retire, it was because he had sown the word, and because it was not right to inflame their wrath. (h) Then they went over all the cities in which they had been in danger. \"And on the morrow,\" it says, \"he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. And when they had preached the Gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.\" (v. 21, 22.) This they said, this they showed. But it is purposely so done, not only by[fn-12-P1235_1187401:8-nf] the Apostles, but by the disciples also, that they may learn from the very outset both the might of the preaching, and that they must themselves also suffer such things, that they may stand nobly, not idly gaping for the miracles, but much more (ready) for the trials. Therefore also the Apostle himself said, \"Having the same conflict which ye saw in me and heard.\" (Phil. i. 30.) Persecutions succeeded to persecutions: wars, fightings, stonings. (g) These things, not less than the miracles, both made them more illustrious, and prepared for them a greater rejoicing. The Scripture nowhere says that they returned rejoicing because they had done miracles, but (it does say that they rejoiced), that \"they were counted worthy for that Name to suffer shame.\" (ch. v. 41.) And this they were taught of Christ, saying, \"Rejoice not that the devils obey you.\" (Luke x. 20.) For the joy indeed and without alloy is this, to suffer aught for Christ's sake. (i) \"And that through much tribulation:\" what sort of cheering (protroph) is this? how did they persuade them, by telling them at the outset of tribulations? Then also another consolation.[fn-12-P1236_1188685:9-nf] \"And when they had appointed for them elders in every Church,[fn-12-P1237_1189261:10-nf] and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.

Why do they come back to Antioch? To report what had taken place yonder. And besides, there is a great purpose of Providence concerned: for it was needful that they should thenceforth preach with boldness to the Gentiles. They come therefore, reporting these things, that they may be able to know them: and it is providentially ordered, that just then came those who forbade to keep company with the Gentiles in order that from Jerusalem they might obtain great encouragement, and so go their ways with boldness. And besides, it shows that in their temper there was nothing of self-will: for they come, at the same time showing their boldness, in that without the authority of those (at Jerusalem) they had preached to the Gentiles, and their obedience, in that they refer the matter to them: for they were not made arrogant, as (apenohqhsan) having achieved so great successes. \"Whence,\" it says, \"they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.\" And yet moreover the Spirit had said, \"Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.\" (ch. xiii. 2.) \"And when they were come, and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

But how He has revealed this I do not recount in human language, but in divine. There is, to begin with, the fact that God's precepts themselves would be of no use to a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by performing them he might obtain the promised rewards. For they are given that no one might be able to plead the excuse of ignorance, as the Lord says concerning the Jews in the gospel: \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.\"[fn-58-P5893_2311963:5-nf] Of what sin does He speak but of that great one which He foreknew, while speaking thus, that they would make their own-that is, the death they were going to inflict upon Him? For they did not have \"no sin\" before Christ came to them in the flesh. The apostle also says: \"The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold back the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them.

Now whence arose such conduct, except from his own will? Upon this, however, the ten tribes of Israel revolted from him, and chose for themselves another king, even Jeroboam, that the will of God in His anger might be accomplished which He had predicted would come to pass.[fn-62-P6256_2408485:248-nf] For what says the Scripture? \"The king hearkened not unto the people; for the turning was from the Lord, that He might perform His saying, which the Lord spake to Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\"[fn-62-P6257_2408734:249-nf] All this, indeed, was done by the will of man, although the turning was from the Lord. Read the books of the Chronicles, and you will find the following passage in the second book: \"Moreover, the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were neighbours to the Ethiopians; and they came up to the land of Judah, and ravaged it, and carried away all the substance which was found in the king's house.\"[fn-62-P6258_2409206:250-nf] Here it is shown that God stirs up enemies to devastate the countries which He adjudges deserving of such chastisement. Still, did these Philistines and Arabians invade the land of Judah to waste it with no will of their own? Or were their movements so directed by their own will that the Scripture lies which tells us that \"the Lord stirred up their spirit\" to do all this? Both statements to be sure are true, because they both came by their own will, and yet the Lord stirred up their spirit; and this may also with equal truth be stated the other way: The Lord both stirred up their spirit, and yet they came of their own will. For the Almighty sets in motion even in the innermost hearts of men the movement of their will, so that He does through their agency whatsoever He wishes to perform through them,-even He who knows not how to will anything in unrighteousness. What, again, is the purport of that which the man of God said to King Amaziah: \"Let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim: for if thou shalt think to obtain with these, the Lord shall put thee to flight before thine enemies: for God hath power either to strengthen or to put to flight \"?[fn-62-P6259_2410467:251-nf] Now, how does the power of God help some in war by giving them confidence, and put others to flight by injecting fear into them, except it be that He who has made all things according to His own will, in heaven and on earth,[fn-62-P6260_2410719:252-nf] also works in the hearts of men? We read also what Joash, king of Israel, said when he sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, who wanted to fight with him. After certain other words, he added, \"Now tarry at home; why dost thou challenge me to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?\"[fn-62-P6261_2411057:253-nf] Then the Scripture has added this sequel: \"But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might be delivered into their hands, because they sought after the gods of Edom.\"[fn-62-P6262_2411262:254-nf] Behold, now, how God, wishing to punish the sin of idolatry, wrought this in this man's heart, with whom He was indeed justly angry, not to listen to sound advice, but to despise it, and go to the battle, in which he with his army was routed. God says by the prophet Ezekiel, \"If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet: I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.\"[fn-62-P6263_2411754:255-nf] Then there is the book of Esther, who was a woman of the people of Israel, and in the land of their captivity became the wife of the foreign King Ahasuerus. In this book it is written, that, being driven by necessity to interpose in behalf of her people, whom the king had ordered to be slain in every part of his dominions, she prayed to the Lord. So strongly was she urged by the necessity of the case, that she even ventured into the royal presence without the king's command, and contrary to her own custom. Now observe what the Scripture says: \"He looked at her like a bull in the vehemence of his indignation; and the queen was afraid, and her colour changed as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of her delicate maiden which went before her. But God turned the king, and transformed his indignation into gentleness.\"[fn-62-P6264_2412613:256-nf] The Scripture says in the Proverbs of Solomon, \"Even as the rush of water, so is the heart of a king in God's hand; He will turn it in whatever way He shall choose.\"[fn-62-P6265_2412822:257-nf] Again, in the 104th Psalm, in reference to the Egyptians, one reads what God did to them: \"And He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal subtilly with His servants.\"[fn-62-P6266_2413017:258-nf] Observe, likewise, what is written in the letters of the apostles.

In the Epistle of Paul, the Apostle, to the Romans occur these words: \"Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts;\"[fn-62-P6267_2413257:259-nf] and a little afterwards: \"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;\"[fn-62-P6268_2413357:260-nf] again, in the next passage: \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.\"[fn-62-P6269_2413554:261-nf] So also in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle says of sundry persons, \"Inasmuch as they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; therefore also God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"[fn-62-P6270_2413920:262-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":44,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Who can help trembling at those judgments of God by which He does in the hearts of even wicked men whatsoever He wills, at the same time rendering to them according to their deeds? Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, rejected the salutary counsel of the old men, not to deal harshly with the people, and preferred listening to the words of the. young men of his own age, by returning a rough answer to those to whom he should have spoken gently. Now whence arose such conduct, except from his own will? Upon this, however, the ten tribes of Israel revolted from him, and chose for themselves another king, even Jeroboam, that the will of God in His anger might be accomplished which He had predicted would come to pass.[fn-62-P6256_2408485:248-nf] For what says the Scripture? \"The king hearkened not unto the people; for the turning was from the Lord, that He might perform His saying, which the Lord spake to Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\"[fn-62-P6257_2408734:249-nf] All this, indeed, was done by the will of man, although the turning was from the Lord. Read the books of the Chronicles, and you will find the following passage in the second book: \"Moreover, the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were neighbours to the Ethiopians; and they came up to the land of Judah, and ravaged it, and carried away all the substance which was found in the king's house.\"[fn-62-P6258_2409206:250-nf] Here it is shown that God stirs up enemies to devastate the countries which He adjudges deserving of such chastisement. Still, did these Philistines and Arabians invade the land of Judah to waste it with no will of their own? Or were their movements so directed by their own will that the Scripture lies which tells us that \"the Lord stirred up their spirit\" to do all this? Both statements to be sure are true, because they both came by their own will, and yet the Lord stirred up their spirit; and this may also with equal truth be stated the other way: The Lord both stirred up their spirit, and yet they came of their own will. For the Almighty sets in motion even in the innermost hearts of men the movement of their will, so that He does through their agency whatsoever He wishes to perform through them,-even He who knows not how to will anything in unrighteousness. What, again, is the purport of that which the man of God said to King Amaziah: \"Let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim: for if thou shalt think to obtain with these, the Lord shall put thee to flight before thine enemies: for God hath power either to strengthen or to put to flight \"?[fn-62-P6259_2410467:251-nf] Now, how does the power of God help some in war by giving them confidence, and put others to flight by injecting fear into them, except it be that He who has made all things according to His own will, in heaven and on earth,[fn-62-P6260_2410719:252-nf] also works in the hearts of men? We read also what Joash, king of Israel, said when he sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, who wanted to fight with him. After certain other words, he added, \"Now tarry at home; why dost thou challenge me to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?\"[fn-62-P6261_2411057:253-nf] Then the Scripture has added this sequel: \"But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might be delivered into their hands, because they sought after the gods of Edom.\"[fn-62-P6262_2411262:254-nf] Behold, now, how God, wishing to punish the sin of idolatry, wrought this in this man's heart, with whom He was indeed justly angry, not to listen to sound advice, but to despise it, and go to the battle, in which he with his army was routed. God says by the prophet Ezekiel, \"If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet: I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.\"[fn-62-P6263_2411754:255-nf] Then there is the book of Esther, who was a woman of the people of Israel, and in the land of their captivity became the wife of the foreign King Ahasuerus. In this book it is written, that, being driven by necessity to interpose in behalf of her people, whom the king had ordered to be slain in every part of his dominions, she prayed to the Lord. So strongly was she urged by the necessity of the case, that she even ventured into the royal presence without the king's command, and contrary to her own custom. Now observe what the Scripture says: \"He looked at her like a bull in the vehemence of his indignation; and the queen was afraid, and her colour changed as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of her delicate maiden which went before her. But God turned the king, and transformed his indignation into gentleness.\"[fn-62-P6264_2412613:256-nf] The Scripture says in the Proverbs of Solomon, \"Even as the rush of water, so is the heart of a king in God's hand; He will turn it in whatever way He shall choose.\"[fn-62-P6265_2412822:257-nf] Again, in the 104th Psalm, in reference to the Egyptians, one reads what God did to them: \"And He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal subtilly with His servants.\"[fn-62-P6266_2413017:258-nf] Observe, likewise, what is written in the letters of the apostles.

Whence it follows that you ought to know what is being done in things sacred in the church of Rome, in order that, by following her example, ye may be found to be true children of her who is called your mother. Accordingly, as we have received the institution from our fathers, we maintain seven deacons in the city of Rome distributed over seven districts of the state, who attend to the services enjoined on them week by week, and on the Lord's days and the solemn festivals, in concert with the subdeacons, and acolytes, and servants of the succeeding orders, and hold themselves in readiness every hour for religious duty, and for the discharge of all that is enjoined upon them. In like manner ought ye also to do throughout your different cities, as may be convenient, that religious duty may be discharged zealously and regularly, without any delay or negligence. Furthermore, we have ordained in like manner seven subdeacons who shall stand by (imminerent) the seven notaries, and bring into one full and accurate account the histories of the martyrs, and lay them before us for our examination. And this, too, we urge you all to do, so that no doubt or questioning of these things may arise in later times; \"for whatsoever things were written, were written for our learning.\"[fn-91-P9195_2985560:1-nf] And whatsoever things are written in truth in our times, are directed to the learning of future times. And therefore we enjoin these duties to be put in charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be found in them, from which an offence (which may God forbid) may arise to the faithful. For this reason also we beg it of your love in paternal benignity, that the holy Church may now find the good-will of your love in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour whenever there is necessity. And as the goodness of your zeal affords us the assurance that we ought to distrust it in nothing, but rather commit these things in all confidence to you as to wise sons of our church; so, small importance being attached to opportune occasions, your virtue ought to exert itself the more strenuously in labours, and keep off reproaches by all possible means, and with all zeal. We exhort you also, according to the word of the apostle, to be \"stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not vain in the Lord.\"[fn-91-P9196_2986656:2-nf] And in another place: \"Watch ye, and pray, and stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men, and be strong. Let all things be done with charity.\"[fn-91-P9197_2986818:3-nf] Furthermore, we desire you to know this, that in our times, as our sins embarrassed us, and that ancient enemy who always goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,[fn-91-P9198_2987024:4-nf] instigated him, Novatus came up out of Africa, and separated Novatianus and certain other confessors of Christ from the Church of Christ, and persuaded them into the acceptance of evil doctrine. From such persons, brethren, keep yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a faith and doctrine different from that which the apostles and their successors have held and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going after him ye fall into the toils of Satan, and be bound with his fetters. Wherefore with most earnest prayers we beg it of your brotherly love, that ye may deem it fit to remember our insignificance in your holy prayers, beseeching and entreating the Lord of heaven that we, as well as our holy mother the Church of Christ, redeemed with His precious blood, may be delivered from the toils of Satan, who lieth in wait for us; and from troublesome and wicked men, and that the Word of God may have free course and be glorified, and that the evil doctrine of them, and of all who teach things contrary to the truth, may be overthrown and perish. We beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious supplications, that our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all men to be saved, and no one to perish,[fn-91-P9199_2988263:5-nf] may, by His vast omnipotence, cause their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the Catholic faith, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the devil who are held captive by him, and be united with the children of our mother the Church. Be mindful also of your brethren, and have pity upon them, and labour for them by all means in your power, that they be not lost, but be saved unto the Lord by your prayers, and other efforts of your goodness. So act therefore in these matters that ye may approve yourselves as obedient and faithful children of the holy Church of God, and that ye may obtain the recompense of reward. These men, and all else who do not teach the true doctrine, and hold not the true faith, cannot act as accusers of any true believer, because they are branded with infamy, and are cut off from the bosom of our holy mother the Church by the sword of the apostles, until their return to correct conversation and belief. Hence by apostolic authority, and in agreement with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal Church, we resolve that all who come under suspicion with respect to the Catholic faith cannot be admitted as accusers of those who hold the true creed; for suspicions are always to be set aside. Rightly therefore are charges which are preferred by those who are objects of suspicion in the matter of the true faith, rejected. Neither are they at all to be credited who are unacquainted with the faith of the Trinity. In like manner we set aside and withdraw from all part in the accusing of the faithful, all those whom the decrees of the holy fathers in times past and times future alike anathematize. Accordingly, the believing ought always to be kept distinct from the unbelieving, and the righteous from the unrighteous; since the unbelieving and evil-minded, by every means in their power, are always troubling the believing, and striving to undo them; and consequently they are not to be received, but rejected and kept entirely at a distance, lest they may undo or defame the believing. For this reason, dearly beloved, beware of the pit of such persons, into which we know many have fallen. Beware of the snares (or darts) of such persons, and of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by which we have seen even those closely connected with us fall wounded before us. Watch the nooses of the liers in wait, by which they are wont to strangle associates and comrades. Follow not such, but keep them far off from you. Be ye, according to the voice of Truth, wise as serpents and harmless as doves.[fn-92-P9200_2990844:6-nf] See to it that ye neither run nor labour in vain; but, sustained by each other's prayers and supplications, strive ye to do the will of God; and from those persons whom I have mentioned, if they show themselves incorrigible, keep yourselves separate in all things. In like manner keep yourselves separate from all those of whom the apostle makes mention when he says, \"with such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9201_2991266:7-nf] since these latter, as well as the former, are to be rejected, and are not to be admitted before they have given satisfaction to the Church. For those with whom it is not lawful to eat are manifestly separated from all intercourse with the rest of the brethren until such satisfaction is given. Wherefore they ought not and cannot be admitted to the preferring of charges against the faithful, but they ought to be debarred from their society until the satisfaction already mentioned is given, lest these too should be made like them, or underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have the apostles decreed, saying, With the excommunicated no fellowship is to be held. And if any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings with the excommunicated in his house, or speaks or prays in company with them, that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion. Such persons, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are not to be received, because, according to the apostle, not only those who commit such things are condemned, but also those who consent with those who do them.[fn-92-P9202_2992387:8-nf] Whence also the blessed chief of the apostles, Peter, addressing the people at the ordination of Clement, says this among other things:[fn-92-P9203_2992538:9-nf] If this Clement is hostile to any one on account of his deeds, wait not ye for his saying directly to you, Be not on terms of friendship with this man. But mark ye carefully his will as ye ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and separate yourselves from that man to whom ye perceive him to be inimical, and speak not with those with whom he speaks not, in order that every one who may be in fault, as he desires to possess the friendship of all of you, may be zealous in effecting a reconciliation all the more quickly with him who presides over all, so that be may return to spiritual well-being (redeat et salutem) hereby, when he begins to yield obedience to the charges of the president.","title":"The First Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_123_letter_cxxiv_to_the_monks_of_palestine_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"And so, as all these heresies have been destroyed, which through the holy devotion of the presiding Fathers have been cut off from the body of the catholic unity, and which deserved to be exiles from Christ, because they have made the Incarnation of the Word, which is the one salvation of those who believe aright, a stone of offence and a stumbling-block to themselves, I am surprised that you, beloved, have any difficulty in discerning the light of the Truth.

Is this what you have learnt from prophets, evangelists, and apostles? to deny the true flesh of Christ, to subject the ,very essence of the Word to suffering and death, to make our nature different from His who repaired it, and to reckon all that the cross uplifted, that the spear pierced, that the stone on the tomb received and gave back, to be only the work: of Divine power, and not also of human humility? It is in reference to this humility that the Apostle says, \"For I do not blush for the Gospel[fn-22-P2222_535484:37-nf] ,\" inasmuch as he knew what a slur was cast upon Christians by their enemies. And, therefore, the Lord also made proclamation, saying: \"he that shall confess Me before men him will I also confess before My Father[fn-22-P2223_535714:38-nf] .\" For these will not be worthy of the Son and the Father's acknowledgment in whom the flesh of Christ awakens no respect: and they will prove themselves to have gained no virtue from the sign of the cross[fn-22-P2224_535941:39-nf] who blush to avow with their lips what they have consented to bear upon their brows.","title":"Letter CXXIV.

It would be tedious to collect out of all the passages in the Gospels the proofs by which the God of the law and of the Gospels is shown to be one and the same. Let us touch briefly upon the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-65-P6532_1285365:41-nf] where Stephen and the other apostles address their prayers to that God who made heaven and earth, and who spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, calling Him the \"God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; \"the God who \"brought forth His people out of the land of Egypt.\" Which expressions undoubtedly clearly direct our understandings to faith in the Creator, and implant an affection for Him in those who have learned piously and faithfully thus to think of Him; according to the words of the Saviour Himself, who, when He was asked which was the greatest commandment in the law, replied, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" And to these He added: \"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-65-P6533_1286230:42-nf] How is it, then, that He commends to him whom He was instructing, and was leading to enter on the office of a disciple, this commandment above all others, by which undoubtedly love was to be kindled in him towards the God of that law, inasmuch as such had been declared by the law in these very words? But let it be granted, notwithstanding all these most evident proofs, that it is of some other unknown God that the Saviour says, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\" etc., etc. How, in that case, if the law and the prophets are, as they say, from the Creator, i.e., from another God than He whom He calls good, shall that appear to be logically said which He subjoins, viz., that \"on these two commandments hang the law and the prophets? \"For how shall that which is strange and foreign to God depend upon Him? And when Paul says, \"I thank my God, whom I serve my spirit from my forefathers with pure conscience,\"[fn-65-P6534_1287194:43-nf] he clearly shows that he came not to some new God, but to Christ. For what other forefathers of Paul can be intended, except those of whom he says, \"Are they Hebrews? so am I: are they Israelites? so am I.\"[fn-65-P6535_1287419:44-nf] Nay, will not the very preface of his Epistle to the Romans clearly show the same thing to those who know how to understand the letters of Paul, viz., what God he preaches? For his words are: \"Paul, the servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart to the Gospel of God, which He had promised afore by His prophets in the holy Scriptures concerning His Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead of Christ Jesus our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6536_1288021:45-nf] etc. Moreover, also the following, \"Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he that plougheth should plough in hope, and he that thresheth in hope of partaking of the fruits.\"[fn-65-P6537_1288362:46-nf] By which he manifestly shows that God, who gave the law on our account, i.e., on account of the apostles, says, \"Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn; \"whose care was not for oxen, but for the apostles, who were preaching the Gospel of Christ. In other passages also, Paul, embracing the promises of the law, says, \"Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise; that it may be well with thee, and that thy days may be long upon the land, the good land, which the Lord thy God will give thee.\"[fn-65-P6538_1288962:47-nf] By which he undoubtedly makes known that the law, and the God of the law, and His promises, are pleasing to him.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Moreover, that which I said, \"That the salvation of this religion has never been lacking to him who was worthy of it, and that he to whom it was lacking was not worthy,\"-if it be discussed and it be asked whence any man can be worthy there are not wanting those who say-by human will. But we say, by divine grace or predestination. Further, between grace and predestination there is only this difference, that predestination is the preparation for grace, while grace is the donation itself. When, therefore the apostle says, \"Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works,\"[fn-67-P6784_2587880:73-nf] it is grace; but what follows-\"which God hath prepared thatwe should walk in them \"-is predestination, which cannot exist without foreknowledge, although foreknowledge may exist without predestination; because God foreknew by predestination those things which He was about to do, whence it was said, \"He made those things that shah be.\"[fn-67-P6785_2588238:74-nf] Moreover, He is able to foreknow even those things which He does not Himself do,-as all sins whatever. Because, although there are some which are in such wise sins as that they are also the penalties of sins, whence it is said, \"God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient,\"[fn-67-P6786_2588572:75-nf] it is not in such a case the sin that is God's, but the judgment. Therefore God's predestination of good is, as I have said, the preparation of grace; which grace is the effect of that predestination. Therefore when God promised to Abraham in his seed the faith of the nations, saying, \"I have established thee a father of many nations,\"[fn-67-P6787_2588928:76-nf] whence the apostle says, \"Therefore it is of faith, that the promise, according to grace, might be established to all the seed,\"[fn-67-P6788_2589076:77-nf] He promised not from the power of our will but from His own predestination. For He promised what He Himself would do, not what men would do. Because, although men do those good things which pertain to God's worship, He Himself makes them to do what He has commanded; it is not they that cause Him to do what He has promised. Otherwise the fulfilment of God's promises would not be in the power of God, but in that of men; and thus what was promised by God to Abraham would be given to Abraham by men themselves. Abraham, however, did not believe thus, but \"he believed, giving glory to God, that what He promised He is able also to do.\"[fn-67-P6789_2589731:78-nf] He does not say, \"to foretell\"-he does not say, \"to foreknow;\" for He can foretell and foreknow the doings of strangers also; but he says, \"He is able also to do;\" and thus he is speaking not of the doings of others, but of His own.","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Therefore in Him who is our Head let there appear to be the very fountain of grace, whence, according to the measure of every man, He diffuses Himself through all His members. It is by that grace that every man from the beginning of his faith becomes a Christian, by which grace that one man from His beginning became Christ. Of the same Spirit also the former is born again of which the latter was born. By the same Spirit is effected in us the remission of sins, by which Spirit it was effected that He should have no sin. God certainly foreknew that He would do these things. This, therefore, is that same predestination of the saints which most especially shone forth in the Saint of saints; and who is there of those who rightly understand the declarations of the truth that can deny this predestination? For we have learned that the Lord of glory Himself was predestinated in so far as the man was made the Son of God. The teacher of the Gentiles exclaims, in the beginning of his epistles, \"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God (which He had promised afore by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures) concerning His Son, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification by the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-68-P6846_2616368:99-nf] Therefore Jesus was predestinated, so that He who was to be the Son of David according to the flesh should yet be in power the Son of God, according to the Spirit of sanctification, because He was born of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary. This is that ineffably accomplished sole taking up of man by God the Word, so that He might truly and properly be called at the same time the Son of God and the Son of man,-Son of man on account of the man taken up, and the Son of God on account of the God only-begotten who took Him up, so that a Trinity and not a Quaternity might be believed in. Such a transporting of human nature was predestinated, so great, so lofty, and so sublime that there was no exalting it more highly,-just as on our behalf that divinity had no possibility of more humbly putting itself off, than by the assumption of man's nature with the weakness of the flesh, even to the death of the cross. As, therefore, that one man was predestinated to be our Head, so we being many are predestinated to be His members. Here let human merits which have perished through Adam keep silence, and let that grace of God reign which reigns through Jesus Christ our Lord, the only Son of God, the one Lord.

Why, then, said the Son to the mother, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come?\" Our Lord Jesus Christ was both God and man. According as He was God, He had not a mother; according as He was man, He had. She was the mother, then, of His flesh, of His humanity, of the weakness which for our sakes He took upon Him. But the miracle which He was about to do, He was about to do according to His divine nature, not according to His weakness; according to that wherein He was God not according to that wherein He was born weak. But the weakness of God is stronger than men.[fn-5-P581_270807:9-nf] His mother then demanded a miracle of Him; but He, about to perform divine works, so far did not recognize a human womb; saying in effect, \"That in me which works a miracle was not born of thee, thou gavest not birth to my divine nature; but because my weakness was born of thee, I will recognize thee at the time when that same weakness shall hang upon the cross.\" This, indeed, is the meaning of \"Mine hour is not yet come.\" For then it was that He recognized, who, in truth, always did know. He knew His mother in predestination, even before He was born of her; even before, as God, He created her of whom, as man, He was to be created, He knew her as His mother: but at a certain hour in a mystery He did not recognize her; and at a certain hour which had not yet come, again in a mystery, He does recognize her. For then did He recognize her, when that to which she gave birth was a-dying. That by which Mary was made did not die, but that which was made of Mary; not the eternity of the divine nature, but the weakness of the flesh, was dying. He made that answer therefore, making a distinction in the faith of believers, between the who; and the how, He came. For whiIe He was God and the Lord of heaven and earth, He came by a mother who was a woman. In that He was Lord of the world, Lord of heaven and earth, He was, of course, the Lord of Mary also; but in that wherein it is said, \"Made of a woman, made under the law,\" He was Mary's son. The same both the Lord of Mary and the son of Mary; the same both the Creator of Mary and created from Mary. Marvel not that He was both son and Lord. For just as He is called the son of Mary, so likewise is He called the son of David; and son of David because son of Mary. Hear the apostle openly declaring, \"Who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-5-P582_272647:10-nf] Hear Him also declared the Lord of David; let David himself declare this: \"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-5-P583_272795:11-nf] And this passage Jesus Himself brought forward to the Jews, and refuted them from it.[fn-5-P584_272897:12-nf] How then was He both David's son and David's Lord? David's son according to the flesh, David's Lord according to His divinity; so also Mary's son after the flesh, and Mary's Lord after His majesty. Now as she was not the mother of His divine nature, whilst it was by His divinity the miracle she asked for would be wrought, therefore He answered her, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\" But think not that I deny thee to be my mother: \"Mine hour is not yet come;\" for in that hour I will acknowledge thee, when the weakness of which thou art the mother comes to hang on the cross. Let us prove the truth of this. When the Lord suffered, the same evangelist tells us, who knew the mother of the Lord, and who has given us to know about her in this marriage feast,-the same, I say, tells us, \"There was there near the cross the mother of Jesus; and Jesus saith to His mother, Woman, behold thy son! and to the disciple, Behold thy mother!\"[fn-5-P585_273853:13-nf] He commends His mother to the care of the disciple; commends His mother, as about to die before her, and to rise again before her death. The man commends her a human being to man's care. This humanity had Mary given birth to.

Valde autem falluntur, ut qui non animadverterint, quam sit filiorum amans omnium mater et genetrix Natura: quoniam enim hoc animal, hyaena inquam, est salacissimum, sub cauda ante excrementi meatum, adnatum est ei quoddam carneum tuberculum, feminino pudendo figura persimile. Nullum autem meatum habet haec figura carnis, qui in utilem aliquam desinat partem, vel in matricem inquam, vel in rectum intestinum: tantum habet magnam concavitatem, quaeinanem excipiat libidinem, quando aversi fuerint meatus, qui in concipiendo fetu occupati sunt. Hoc ipsum autem et masculo et feminae hyae nae adnatum est, quod sit insigniter pathica: masculus enim vicissim et agit, et patitur: unde etiam rarissime inveniri potest hyaena femina: non enim frequenter concipit hoc animal, cum in eis largiter redundet ea, quae praeter naturam est, satio. Hac etiam ratione mihi videtur Plato in Phoedro, amorem puerorum repellens, eum appellate bestiam, quod frenum mordentes, qui se voluptatibus dedunt, libidinosi, quadrupedum coeunt more, et filios seminare conantur.

Sola ergo varia in hyaenis natura, superfluo coitui superfluam hanc partem excogitavit, et ideo est etiam aliquantisper concavum, ut prurientibus partibus inserviat, exinde autem excaecatur concavitas: non fuit emm res fabricata ad generationem. Hinc nobis manifestum atque adeo in confesso est, vitandos esse cum masculis concubitus, et infrugiferas sationes, et Venerem praeposteram, et quae natura coalescere non possunt, androgynorum conjunctiones, ipsam naturam sequentibus, quae id per partium prohibet constitutionem, ut quae masculum non ad semen suscipiendum, sed ad id effundendum fecerit.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_34_sermon_xvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"7.

Hear then the Lord confessing; \"I confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.\"[fn-37-P3778_1642974:29-nf] What do I confess? Wherein do I praise thee? For this confession, as I have said before, signifieth praise. \"Because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\" What is this, Brethren? Understand by that which is opposed to them. \"Thou hast hid these things,\" saith he, \"from the wise and prudent;\" and he did not say, thou hast revealed them to the foolish and imprudent, but \"Thou hast hid these things\" indeed \"from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\" To these wise and prudent, who are really objects of derision, to the arrogant who in false pretence are great, yet in truth are only swollen up, he opposed not the foolish, nor the imprudent, but babes. Who are babes? The humble. Therefore \"Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent.\" Under the name of the wise and prudent, He hath Himself explained that the proud are understood, when He said, \"Thou hast revealed them unto babes.\" Therefore from those who are not babes Thou hast hidden them. What is from those who are not babes? From those who are not humble. And who are they but the proud? O way of the Lord! Either there was none, or it lay hid, that it might be revealed to us. Why did the Lord exult? \"Because it was revealed unto babes.\" We must be little babes; for if we would wish to be great, \"wise and prudent as it were, it is not revealed unto us. Who are these great ones? The wise and prudent. \"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.\"[fn-37-P3779_1644501:30-nf] Here then thou hast a remedy suggested from its opposite. For if by \"professing thyself wise, thou art become a fool; profess thyself a fool, and thou wilt be wise.\" But profess it in truth, profess it from the heart, for it is really so as thou professest. If thou profess it, do not profess it before men, and forbear to profess it before God. As to thyself, and all that is thine, thou art altogether dark. For what else is it to be a fool, but to be dark in heart?

Agreeably with this, we ought to understand that God, though He give not to our will, doth give for our salvation. For suppose the thing thou have asked be to thine hurt, and the Physician knows that it is to thine hurt; what then? It is not to be said that the physician does not give ear to thee, when, perhaps, thou askest for cold water, and if it is good for thee, he gives it immediately, if not good, he gives it not. Had he no ears for thy request, or rather, did he give ear for thy weal, even when he gainsaid thy will? Then let there be in you charity, my brethren; let it be in you, and then set, your minds at rest: even when the thing ye ask for is not given you, your prayer is, granted, only, ye know it not. Many have been given into their own hands, to their own hurt: of whom the apostle saith, \"God gave them up to their own hearts' lusts.\"[fn-43-P4386_2372084:33-nf] Some man hath asked for a great sum of money; he hath received, to his hurt. When he had it not, he had little to fear; no sooner did he come to have it, than he became a prey to the more powerful. Was not that man's request granted to his own hurt, who would needs have that for which he should be sought after by the robber, whereas, being poor, none sought after him? Learn to beseech God that ye may commit it to the Physician to do what He knows best. Do thou confess the disease, let Him apply the means of healing. Do thou only hold fast charity. For He will needs cut, will needs burn; what if thou criest out, and art not spared for thy crying under the cutting, under the burning and the tribulation, yet He knows how far the rottenness reaches.[fn-43-P4387_2372857:34-nf] Thou wouldest have Him even now take off His hands, and He considers only the deepness of the sore; He knows how far to go. He does not attend to thee for thy will, but he does attend to thee for thy healing. Be ye sure, then, my brethren, that what the apostle saith is true: \"For we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered: for He maketh intercession for the saints.\"[fn-43-P4388_2373371:35-nf] How is it said, \"The Spirit itself intercedeth for the saints,\" but as meaning the charity which is wrought in thee by the Spirit?

Set your minds at rest: let charity; ask, and the ears of God are there. Not thatwhich thou wishest is done, but that is done which is advantageous. Therefore, \"whatever we ask,\" saith he, \"we shall receive of Him,\" I have already said, If thou understand it to mean, \"for salvation,\" there is no question: if not for salvation, there is a question, and a great one, a question that makes thee an accuser of the apostle Paul. \"Whatever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do these things that are pleasing in His sight:\" within, where He seeth.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_46_book_xii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Some such thing we read of in the book of Chronicles.

As the apostle also says in the Epistle to the Romans, \"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\" teaching the one salvation which from prophecy to the Gospel is perfected by one and the same Lord. \"This charge,\" he says, \"I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war the good warfare; holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck,\"[fn-57-P5729_1736337:68-nf] because they defiled by unbelief the conscience that comes from God. Accordingly, faith may not, any more, with reason, be disparaged in an offhand way, as simple and vulgar, appertaining to anybody. For, if it were a mere human habit, as the Greeks supposed, it would have been extinguished. But if it grow, and there be no place where it is not; then I affirm, that faith, whether founded in love, or in fear, as its disparagers assert, is something divine; which is neither rent asunder by other mundane friendship, nor dissolved by the presence of fear. For love, on account of its friendly alliance with faith, makes men believers; and faith, which is the foundation of love, in its turn introduces the doing of good; since also fear, the paedagogue of the law, is believed to be fear by those, by whom it is believed. For, if its existence is shown in its working, it is yet believed when about to do and threatening, and when not working and present; and being believed to exist, it does not itself generate faith, but is by faith tested and proved trustworthy. Such a change, then, from unbelief to faith-and to trust in hope and fear, is divine. And, in truth, faith is discovered, by us, to be the first movement towards salvation; after which fear, and hope, and repentance, advancing in company with temperance and patience, lead us to love and knowledge. Rightly, therefore, the Apostle Barnabas says, \"From the portion I have received I have done my diligence to send by little and little to you; that along with your faith you may also have perfect knowledge.[fn-57-P5730_1737935:69-nf] Fear and patience are then helpers of your faith; and our allies are long-suffering and temperance. These, then,\" he says, \"in what respects the Lord, continuing in purity, there rejoice along with them, wisdom, understanding, intelligence, knowledge.\" The fore-mentioned virtues being, then, the elements of knowledge; the result is that faith is more elementary, being as necessary to the Gnostic,[fn-57-P5731_1738460:70-nf] as respiration to him that lives in this world is to life. And as without the four elements it is not possible to live, so neither can knowledge be attained without faith. It is then the support of truth.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_50_oration_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XII.

By which things, and by many deeds of this kind tending to His glory, it appeared to follow as a consequence, that in whatever manner the Jews think about Christ, and although they do not believe concerning Jesus Christ our Lord, that even they themselves thought that such and so great a one would without any death endure to eternity, and would possess the kingdom of Israel, and of the whole world for ever; and that it should not be destroyed. Whence, moreover, the Jews dared to seize Him by force, and anoint Him for the kingdom, which indeed He was compelled to evade; and therefore His disciples thought that in no other way would He bestow upon them eternal life, except He Himself had first continued this temporal life into that eternal one in His own experience. In fine, when they were passing through Galilee, Jesus said to them, \"The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and after three days He shall rise again.\"[fn-107-P10750_3400636:21-nf] and they were greatly grieved, because, as we have said, they had formed a very different notion previously in their minds and hearts.

For when he, together with the others, had been asked by the Lord what he thought about Him, that is, whom he thought Him to be, and had first of all confessed the truth, saying that He was the Christ the Son of the living God, and therefore was judged blessed by Him because he had arrived at this truth, not after the flesh, but by the revelation of the heavenly Father; yet this same Peter, when Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after the third day rise again from the dead; nevertheless that true confessor of Christ, after a few days, taking Him aside, began to rebuke Him, saying, \"Be propitious to Thyself: this shall not be; \"[fn-107-P10752_3402048:23-nf] so that on that account he deserved to hear from the Lord, \"Get thee behind me, Satan;[fn-107-P10753_3402155:24-nf] thou art an offence unto me, because he savoured not the things which are of God, but those things which are of men.\" Which rebuke against Peter became more and more apparent when the Lord was apprehended, and, frightened by the damsel, he said, \"I know not what thou sayest, neither know I thee; \"[fn-107-P10754_3402761:25-nf] and again when, using an oath, he said this same thing; and for the third time, cursing and swearing, he affirmed that he knew not the man, and not once, but frequently, denied Him.[fn-107-P10755_3402964:26-nf] And this disposition, because it was to continue to him even to the Lord's passion, was long before made manifest by the Lord, that we also might not be ignorant of it. Again, after the Lord's resurrection, one of His disciples, Cleopas, when he was, according to the error of all his fellow-disciples, sorrowfully telling what had happened to the Lord Himself, as if to some unknown person, spoke thus, saying of Jesus the Nazarene, \"who was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people; how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and fastened Him to the cross. But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel.\"[fn-107-P10756_3403932:27-nf] And in addition to these things, all the disciples also judged the declaration of the women who had seen the Lord after the resurrection to be idle tales; and some of themselves, when they had seen Him, believed not, but doubted; and they who were not then present believed not at all until they had been subsequently by the Lord Himself in all ways rebuked and reproached; because His death had so offended them that they thought that He had not risen again, who they had believed ought not to have died, because contrary to their belief He had died once. And thus, as far as concerns the disciples themselves, they are found to have had a faith neither sound nor perfect in such matters as we have referred to; and what is much more serious, they moreover baptized others, as it is written in the Gospel according to John.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_55_oration_xliii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"11.

For of these the Psalmist says: \"They are not in the labours of men; neither shall they be scourged like other men.\"[fn-43-P4344_1601559:54-nf] For theyare not worthy of being healed by the visitation of the Lord which gives life, and by plagues in this world, as \"in despair they have given themselves over to lasciviousness, unto the working of all error unto uncleanness,\"[fn-43-P4345_1601820:55-nf] and as by hardening their hearts, and by growing accustomed and used to sin they have got beyond cleansing in this brief life and punishment in the present world: men, who are thus reproved by the holy word of the prophet: \"I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not to Me, saith the Lord,\"[fn-43-P4346_1602225:56-nf] and Jeremiah: \"I have killed and destroyed thy people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.\"[fn-43-P4347_1602346:57-nf] And again: \"Thou hast smitten them and they have not grieved: Thou hast bruised them and they refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, they have refused to return.\"[fn-43-P4348_1602567:58-nf] And the prophet seeing that all the remedies of this life will have been applied in vain for their healing, and already as it were despairing of their life, declares: \"The bellows have failed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.\"[fn-43-P4349_1602924:59-nf] And the Lord thus laments that to no purpose has He applied this salutary cleansing by fire to those who are hardened in their sins, in the person of Jerusalem crusted all over with the rust of her sins, when He says: \"set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof. Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, no not even by fire. Thy uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness.\"[fn-43-P4350_1603518:60-nf] Wherefore like a skilful physician, who has tried all saving cures, and sees there is no remedy left which can be applied to their disease, the Lord is in a manner overcome by their iniquities and is obliged to desist from that kindly chastisement of His, and so denounces them saying: \"I will no longer be angry with thee, and thy jealousy has departed from thee.\"[fn-43-P4351_1603908:61-nf] But of others, whose heart has not grown hard by continuance in sin, and who do not stand in need of that most severe and (if I may so call it) caustic remedy, but for whose salvation the instruction of the life-giving word is suffi- cient-of them it is said: \"I will improve them by hearing of their suffering.\"[fn-43-P4352_1604242:62-nf] We are well aware that there are other reasons also of the punishment and vengeance whichis inflicted on those who have sinned grievously-not to expiate their crimes, nor wipeout the deserts of their sins, but that the living may be put in fear and amend their lives. And these we plainly see were inflicted on Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Baasha the son of Ahiah, and Ahab and Jezebel, when the Divine reproof thus declares: \"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will cut down thy posterity, and will kill of Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and the last in Israel. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahiah: for that which thou hast done to provoke Me to anger, and for making Israel to sin. The dogs also shall eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel. If Ahab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field the birds of the air shall eat him,\"[fn-43-P4353_1605220:63-nf] and this which is threatened as the greatest threat of all: \"Thy dead body shall not be brought to the sepulchre of thy fathers.\"[fn-43-P4354_1605375:64-nf] It was not that this short and momentary punishment would suffice to purge away the blasphemous inventions of him who first made the golden calves and led to the lasting sin of the people, and their wicked separation from the Lord,-or the countless and disgraceful profanities of those others, but it was that by their example the fear of those punishments which they dreaded might fall on others also, who, as they thought little of the future or even disbelieved in it altogether, would only be moved by consideration of things present; and that owing to this proof of His severity they might acknowledge that there is no lack of care for the affairs of men, and for their daily doings, in the majesty of God on high, and so through that which they greatly feared might the more clearly See in God the rewarder of all their deeds. We find, it is true, that even for lighter faults some men have received the same sentence of death in this world, as that with which those men were punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a blasphemous falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath,[fn-43-P4355_1606532:65-nf] and in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the sin of unbelief kept back some portion of their goods: not that the guilt of their sins was equal, but because they were the firstfound out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they had given to others an example of sin, so also they should give them an example of punishment and of fear, that anyone, who should attempt to copy them, might know that (even if his punishment were postponed in this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the trial of the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run through the different kinds of trials and punishments we seem to have wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were saying that the perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now let us return to it once more.","title":"VI.

It therefore follows that it is the opinion of the wise among the Jews which the apostle inveighs against it.

(d) \"Who having examined me,\" says he, \"found nothing in me\" (v. 18). When those ought to have rescued, they \"delivered (him) into the hands of the Romans.\" And such the superabundance,[fn-19-P1907_1927350:4-nf] * * because those had not power to condemn but delivered him prisoner. \"Not as having aught to accuse my nation of,\" (v. 19) am I come. See what friendliness of expression \"my nation:\" he does not hold them as aliens. He does not say, I do not accuse, but, \"I have not (whereof) to accuse:\" although he had suffered so many evils at their hands. But nothing of all this does he say, nor make his speech offensive: neither does he seem to be sparing them as matter of favor. For this was the main point, to show that they delivered him prisoner to the Romans,[fn-19-P1908_1928229:5-nf] when those ought to have condemned him. (a) \"For this cause,\" he says, \"I wished to see you\" (v. 20): that it might not be in any man's power to accuse me, and to say what (naturally) might suggest itself (ta paristamena), that having escaped their hands I have come for this: not to bring evils upon others, but myself fleeing from evils. \"I was compelled to appeal unto Cae6sar.\" Observe them also speaking more mildly to him. \"We beg,\" say they: and wish to speak in exculpation of those (at Jerusalem). (e) Whereas they ought to accuse them, they plead for them: by the very fact of their exonerating them, they do in fact accuse them.[fn-19-P1909_1929488:6-nf] (b) For this very thing was a proof that they knew themselves exceedingly in the wrong. Had they been confident, they would at any rate have done this, so that he should not have it in his power to make out his story in his own way, and besides they shrank from coming. And by their many times attempting they showed * * (f) \"As for this sect, it is known to us,\" say they, \"that it is everywhere spoken against.\" (v. 21, 21.)[fn-19-P1910_1931849:7-nf] True, but (people) are also everywhere persuaded (as, in fact, here), \"some were persuaded, and some believed not. And when they had appointed him a day,\" etc. (v. 23-25.) See again how not by miracles but by Law and Prophets he puts them to silence, and how we always find him doing this. And yet he might also have wrought signs; but then it would no longer have been matter of faith. In fact, this (itself) was a great sign, his discoursing from the Law and the Prophets. Then that you may not deem it strange (that they believed not), he introduces the prophecy which saith \"Hearing ye shall hear and not understand,\" more now than then: \"and ye shall see and not perceive\" (v. 26) more now than then. This is not spoken for the former sort, but for the unbelievers. How then? Was it contrary to the prophecy, that those believed? (\"Go,\") it says, \"unto this people\" (that is), to the unbelieving people. He did not say this to insult them, but to remove the offence. \"Be it known then,\" he says, \"unto you, that unto the Gentiles is sent the salvation of God. They,\" says he, \"will hear it too.\" (v. 28.) Then why dost thou discourse to us? Didst thou not know this? Yes, but that ye might be persuaded, and that I might exculpate myself, and give none a handle (against me). (c) The unbelieving were they that withdrew. But see how they do not now form plots against him. For in Judea they had a sort of tyranny. Then wherefore did the Providence of God order that he should go thither, and yet the Lord had said, \"Get thee out quickly from Jerusalem?\" (ch. xxii. 18.) That both their wickedness might be shown and Christ's prophecy made good, that they would not endure to hear him: and so that all might learn that he was ready to suffer all things, and that the event might be for the consolation of those in Judea: for there also (the brethren) were suffering many grievous evils. But if while preaching the Jewish doctrines, he suffered thus, had he preached the doctrines of the glory of Christ, how would they have endured him? While \"purifying himself\" (ch. xxi. 26) he was intolerable, and how should he have been tolerable while preaching? What[fn-19-P1911_1935132:8-nf] lay ye to his charge? What have ye heard? He spoke nothing of the kind. He was simply seen, and he exasperated all against him. Well might he then be set apart for the Gentiles: well might he be sent afar off: there also destined to discourse to the Gentiles. First he calls the Jews, then having shown them the facts he comes to the Gentiles. (ch. xxiv. 18.) \"Well spake the Holy Ghost,\" etc. But this saying, \"The Spirit said,\" is nothing wonderful: for an angel also is said to say what the Lord saith: but[fn-19-P1912_1935912:9-nf] He (the Spirit) not so. When one is speaking of the things said by the angel, one does not say, Well said the angel, but, Well said the Lord. \"Well said the Spirit:\" as much as to say, It is not me that ye disbelieve. But God foreknew this from the first. \"He discoursed,\" it says, \"with boldness, unhindered\" (v. 31): for it is possible to speak with boldness, yet hindered. His boldness nothing checked: but in fact he also spoke unhindered. (c) \"Discoursed,[fn-19-P1913_1937310:10-nf] \" it says, \"the things concerning the kingdom of God:\" mark, nothing of the things of sense, nothing of the things present. (f) But of his affairs after the two years, what say we? (b) (The writer) leaves the hearer athirst for more: the heathen authors do the same (in their writings), for to know everything makes the reader dull and jaded. Or else he does this, (e) not having it in his power to exhibit it from his own personal knowledge. (a) Mark the order of God's Providence,[fn-19-P1914_1939378:11-nf] \"I have been much hindered from coming unto you ...having a great desire these many years to come unto you.\" (Rom xv. 22, 23.) (d) But he fed them with hopes. (g) I am in haste to go to Spain, and \"I hope,\" says he, \"to see you in my journey, and to be brought thitherward on my journey by you, if first I be filled with your company in some measure.\" (ib. 24.) (i) Of this he says, I will come and rest together with you \"in the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel\" (ib. 29): and again \"I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints\" (ib. 25): this is the same that he has said here, \"To do alms to my nation I came.\" (Acts xxiv. 17.) (h) Do you mark how he did not foresee everything-that sacred and divine head, the man higher than the heavens, that had a soul able to grasp all at once, the holder of the first place-Paul? The man whose very name, to them that know him, suffices for rousing of the soul, for vigilance, for shaking off all sleep! Rome received him bound, coming up from the sea, saved from a ship-wreck-and was saved from the shipwreck of error. Like an emperor that has fought a naval battle and overcome, he entered into that most imperial city. (k) He was nearer now to his crown. Rome received him bound, and saw him crowned and proclaimed conqueror. There he had said, I will rest together with you: but this was the beginning of a course once more, and he added trophies to trophies, a man not to be overcome. Corinth kept him two years, and Asia three, and this city two for this time; a second time he again entered it, when also he was consummated. Thus he escaped then, and having filled the whole world, he so brought his life toa close. Why didst thou wish to learn what happened after these two years? Those too are such as these: bonds, tortures, fightings, imprisonments, lyings in wait, false accusations, deaths, day by day. Thou hast seen but a small part of it? How much soever thou hast seen, such is he for all the rest. As in the case of the sky, if thou see one part of it, go where thou wilt thou shalt see it such as this: as it is with the sun, though thou see its rays but in part, thou mayest conjecture the rest: so is it with Paul. His Acts thou hast seen in part; such are they all throughout, teeming with dangers. He was a heaven having in it the Sun of Righteousness, not such a sun (as we see): so that that man was better than the very heaven.

And this was received by almost all the body of monks residing in the whole province of Egypt with such bitterness owing to their simplicity and error, that the greater part of the Elders decreed that on the contrary the aforesaid Bishop ought to be abhorred by the whole body of the brethren as tainted with heresy of the worst kind, because he seemed to impugn the teaching of holy Scripture by the denial that Almighty God was formed in the fashion of a human figure, though Scripture teaches with perfect clearness that Adam was created in His image. Lastly this letter was rejected also by those who were living in the desert of Scete and who excelled all who were in the monasteries of Egypt, in perfection and in knowledge, so that except Abbot Paphnutius the presbyter of our congregation, not one of the other presbyters, who presided over the other three churches in the same desert, would suffer it to be even read or repeated at all in their meetings.","title":"X.

For the Bishops who all assembled from all parts at the Council of Nicaea, began to hold their ears at these statements, and all with one voice condemned this heresy on account of them, and anathematized it, declaring it to be alien and estranged from the faith of the Church. It was no compulsion which led the judges to this decision, but they all deliberately vindicated the truth[fn-40-P4006_1682105:69-nf] : and they did so justly and rightly. For infidelity is coming in through these men, or rather a Judaism counter to the Scriptures, which has close upon it Gentile superstition, so that he who holds these opinions can no longer be even called a Christian, for they are all contrary to the Scriptures. John, for instance, saith, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-40-P4007_1682817:70-nf] ;' but these men say, `He was not, before He was begotten.' And again he wrote, `And we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God, and eternal life[fn-40-P4008_1683015:71-nf] ;' but these men, as if in contradiction to this, allege that Christ is not the true God, but that He is only called God, as are other creatures, in regard of His participation in the divine nature. And the Apostle blames the Gentiles, because they worship the creatures, saying, `They served the creature more than' God `the Creator[fn-40-P4009_1683368:72-nf] .' But if these men say that the Lord is a creature, and worship Him as a creature, how do they differ from the Gentiles? If they hold this opinion, is not this passage also against them; and does not the blessed Paul write as blaming them? The Lord also says, `I and My Father are One:' and `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father[fn-40-P4010_1683772:73-nf] ;' and the Apostle who was sent by Him to preach, writes, `Who being the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His Persons[fn-40-P4011_1683958:74-nf] .' But these men dare to separate them, and to say that He is alien from the essence and eternity of the Father; and impiously to represent Him as changeable, not perceiving, that by speaking thus, they make Him to be, not one with the Father, but one with created things. Who does not see, that the brightness cannot be separated from the light, but that it is by nature proper to it, and co-existent with it, and is not produced after it? Again, when the Father says, `This is My beloved Son[fn-40-P4012_1684468:75-nf] ,' and when the Scriptures say that `He is the Word' of the Father, by whom `the heavens were established[fn-40-P4013_1684594:76-nf] ,' and in short, `All things were made by Him[fn-40-P4014_1684660:77-nf] ;' these inventors of new doctrines and fictions represent that there is another Word, and another Wisdom of the Father, and that He is only called the Word and the Wisdom conceptually on account of things endued with reason, while they perceive not the absurdity of this.","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_19_tractate_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. What means, then, \"He must increase, but I must decrease\"? This is a great mystery! Before the Lord Jesus came, men were glorying of themselves; He came a man, to lessen man's glory, and to increase the glory of God. Now He came without sin, and found all men in sin. If thus He came to put away sin, God may freely give, man may confess. For man's confession is man's lowliness: God's pity is God's loftiness. Therefore, since He came to forgive man his sins, let man acknowledge his own lowliness and let God show His pity. \"He must increase, but I must decrease:\" that is, He must give, but I must receive; He must be glorified, but I must confess. Let man know his own condition, and confess to God; and hear the apostle as he says to a proud, elated man, bent on extolling himself: \"What hast thou that thou didst not receive? And if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou didst not receive it?\"[fn-8-P824_439607:2-nf] Then let man understand that he has received; and when he would call that his own which is not his, let him decrease: for it is good for him that God be glorified in him. Let him decrease in himself, that he may be increased in God. These testimonies and this truth, Christ and John signified by their deaths. For John was lessened by the Head: Christ was exalted on the cross; so that even there it appeared what this is, \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" Again, Christ was born when the days were just beginning to lengthen; John was born when they began to shorten. Thus their very creation and deaths testify to the words of John, when he says, \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" May the glory of God then increase in us, and our own glory decrease, that even ours may increase in God! For this is what the apostle says, this is what Holy Scripture says: \"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-8-P825_440545:3-nf] Wilt thou glory in thyself? Thou wilt grow; but grow worse in thy evil. For whoso grows worse is justly decreased. Let God, then, who is ever perfect, grow, and grow in thee. For the more thou understandest God, and apprehendest Him, He seems to be growing in thee; but in Himself He grows not, being ever perfect. Thou didst understand a little yesterday; thou understandest more to-day, wilt understand much more to-morrow: the very light of God increases in thee: as if thus God increases, who remains ever perfect. It is as if one's eyes were being cured of former blindness, and he began to see a little glimmer of light, and the next day he saw more, and the third day still more: to him the light would seem to grow; yet the light is perfect, whether he see it or not. Thus it is also with the inner man: he makes progress indeed in God, and God seems to be increasing in him; yet man himself is decreasing, that he may fall from his own glory, and rise into the glory of God.","title":"Tractate XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_18_part_ii_dogmatical_and_historical_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"ANF-05","text":"64.

Oh, if placed on that lofty watch-tower you could gaze into the secret places-if you could open the closed doors of sleeping chambers, and recall their dark recesses to the perception of sight,-you would behold things done by immodest persons which no chaste eye could look upon; you would see what even to see is a crime; you would see what people embruted with the madness of vice deny that they have done, and yet hasten to do,-men with frenzied lusts rushing upon men, doing things which afford no gratification even to those who do them. I am deceived if the man who is guilty of such things as these does not accuse others of them. The depraved maligns the depraved, and thinks that he himself, though conscious of the guilt, has escaped, as if consciousness were not a sufficient condemnation. The same people who are accusers in public are criminals in private, condemning themselves at the same time as they condemn the culprits; they denounce abroad what they commit at home, willingly doing what, when they have done, they accuse,-a daring which assuredly is fitly mated with vice, and an impudence quite in accordance with shameless people.

For unless our mind is strengthened by the power of His protection Who says in the gospel \"the kingdom of God is within you,\"[fn-61-P6111_2175480:23-nf] in vain do we fancy that we can defeat the plots of our airy foe by the aid of men who are living with us, or that we can avoid them by distance of place, or exclude them by the protection of walls. For though none of these things was wanting to Saint Paphnutius yet the tempter did not fail to find a way of access against him to attack him; nor did the encircling walls, or the solitude of the desert or the merits of all those saints in the congregation repulse that most foul spirit. But because the holy servant of God had fixed the hope of his heart not on those external things but on Him Who is the judge of all secrets, he could not be moved even by the machinations of such an assault as that. On the other hand did not the man whom envy had hurried into so grievous a sin enjoy the benefit of solitude and the protection of a retired dwelling, and intercourse with the blessed Abbot and Presbyter Isidore and other saints? And yet because the storm raised by the devil found him upon the sand, it not only drove in his house but actually overturned it. We need not then seek for our peace in externals, nor fancy that another person's patience can be of any use to the faults of our impatience. For just as \"the kingdom of God is within you,\" so \"a man's foes are they of his own household.\"[fn-61-P6112_2176806:24-nf] For no one is more my enemy than my own heart which is truly the one of my household closest to me. And therefore if we are careful, we cannot possibly be injured by intestine enemies. For where those of our own household are not opposed to us, there also the kingdom of God is secured in peace of heart. For if you diligently investigate the matter, I cannot be injured by any man however spiteful, if I do not fight against myself with warlike heart. But if I am injured, the fault is not owing to the other's attack, but to my own impatience. For as strong and solid food is good for a man in good health, so it is bad for a sick one. But it cannot hurt the man who takes it, unless the weakness of its recipient gives it its power to hurt. If then any similar temptation ever arises among brethren, we need never be shaken out of the even tenor of our ways and give an opening to the blasphemous snarls of men living in the world, nor wonder that some bad and detestable men have secretly found their way into the number of the saints, because so long as we are trodden down and trampled in the threshing floor of this world, the chaff which is destined for eternal fire is quite sure to be mingled with the choicest of the wheat. Finally if we bear in mind that Satan was chosen among the angels, and Judas among the apostles, and Nicholas the author of a detestable heresy among the deacons, it will be no wonder that the basest of men are found among the ranks of the saints. For although some maintain that this Nicholas was not the same man who was chosen for the work of the ministry by the Apostles,[fn-61-P6113_2178439:25-nf] nevertheless they cannot deny that he was of the number of the disciples, all of whom were clearly of such a character and so perfect as those few whom we can now with difficulty discover in the coenobia. Let us then bring forward not the fall of the above-mentioned brother, who fell in the desert with so grievous a collapse, nor that horrible stain which he afterwards wiped out by the copious tears of his penitence, but the example of the blessed Paphnutius; and let us not be destroyed by the ruin of the former, whose ingrained sin of envy was increased and made worse by his affected piety, but let us imitate with all our might the humility of the latter, which in his case was no sudden production of the quiet of the desert, but had been gained among men, and was consummated and perfected by solitude. However you should know that the evil of envy is harder to be cured than other faults, for I should almost say that a man whom it has once tainted with the mischief of its poison is without a remedy. For it is the plague of which it is figuratively said by the prophet: \"Behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you.\"[fn-61-P6114_2180237:26-nf] Rightly then are the stings of envy compared by the prophet to the deadly poison of basilisks, as by it the first author of all poisons and their chief perished and died. For he slew himself before him of whom he was envious, and destroyed himself before that he poured forth the poison of death against man: for \"by the envy of the devil death entered into the world: they therefore who are on his side follow him.\"[fn-61-P6115_2180674:27-nf] For just as he who was the first to be corrupted by the plague of that evil, admitted no remedy of penitence, nor any healing plaster, so those also who have given themselves up to be smitten by the same pricks, exclude all the aid of the sacred charmer, because as they are tormented not by the faults but by the prosperity of those of whom they are jealous, they are ashamed to display the real truth and look out for some external unnecessary and trifling causes of offence: and of these, because they are altogether false, vain is the hope of cure, while the deadly poison which they will not produce is lurking in their veins. Of which the wisest of men has fitly said: \"If a serpent bite without hissing, there is no supply for the charmer.\"[fn-61-P6116_2181444:28-nf] For those are silent bites, to which alone the medicine of the wise is no succour. For that evil is so far incurable that it is made worse by attentions, it is increased by services, is irritated by presents, because as the same Solomon says: \"envy endures nothing.\"[fn-61-P6117_2181728:29-nf] For just in proportion as another has made progress in humble submission or in the virtue of patience or in the merit of munificence, so is a man excited by worse pricks of envy, because he desires nothing less than the ruin or death of the man whom he envies. Lastly no submission on the part of their harmless brother could soften the envy of the eleven patriarchs, so that Scripture relates of them: \"But his brothers envied him because his father loved him, and they could not speak peaceably unto him\"[fn-61-P6118_2182256:30-nf] until their jealousy, which would not listen to any entreaties on the part of their obedient and submissive brother, desired his death, and would scarcely be satisfied with the sin of selling a brother. It is plain then thatenvy is worse than all faults, and harder to get rid of, as it is inflamed by those remedies by which the others are destroyed. For, for example, a man who is grieved by a loss that has been caused to him, is healed by a liberal compensation: one who is sore owing to a wrong done to him, is appeased by humble satisfaction being made. What can you do with one who is the more offended by the very fact that he sees you humbler and kinder, who is not aroused to anger by any greed which can be appeased by a bribe; or by any injurious attack or love of vengeance, which is overcome by obsequious services; but is only irritated by another's success and happiness? But who is there who in order to satisfy one who envies him, would wish to fall from his good fortune, or to lose his prosperity or to be involved in some calamity? Wherefore we must constantly implore the divine aid, to which nothing is impossible, in order that the serpent may not by a single bite of this evil destroy whatever is flourishing in us, and animated as it were by the life and quickening power of the Holy Ghost. For the other poisons of serpents, i.e., carnal sins and faults, in which human frailty is easily entangled and from which it is as easily purified, show some traces of their wounds in the flesh, whereby although the earthly body is most dangerously inflamed, yet if any charmer well skilled in divine incantations applies a cure and antidote or the remedy of words of salvation, the poisonous evil does not reach to the everlasting death of the soul. But the poison of envy as if emitted by the basilisk, destroys the very life of religion and faith, even before the wound is perceived in the body. For he does not raise himself up against men, but, in his blasphemy, against God, who carps at nothing in his brother except his felicity, and so blames no fault of man, but simply the judgment of God. This then is that \"root of bitterness springing up\"[fn-61-P6119_2184449:31-nf] which raises itself to heaven and tends to reproaching the very Author Who bestows good things on man. Nor shall anyone be disturbed because God threatens to send \"serpents, basilisks,\"[fn-61-P6120_2184654:32-nf] to bite those by whose crimes He is offended. For although it is certain that God cannot be the author of envy, yet it is fair and worthy of the divine judgment that, while good gifts are bestowed on the humble and refused to the proud and reprobate, those who, as the Apostle says, deserve to be given over \"to a reprobate mind,\"[fn-61-P6121_2185005:33-nf] should be smitten and consumed by envy sent as it were by Him, according to this passage: \"They have provoked me to jealousy by them that are no gods: and I will provoke them to jealousy by them that are no nation.\"[fn-61-P6122_2185238:34-nf] ","title":"XVIII.

Doubtless it is that truly good part, the grand and lasting character of which is thus described by the Lord, when Mary disregarded the duties of hospitality and courtesy and chose it: \"Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: but there is but need of but few things or even of one only. Mary hath chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her.\"[fn-65-P6537_2334330:7-nf] Contemplation then, i.e., meditation on God, is the one thing, the value of which all the merits of our righteous acts, all our aims at virtue, come short of. And all those things which we said existed in the Apostle Paul, were not only good and useful, but even great and splendid. But as, for example, the metal of alloy which is considered of some use and worth, becomes worthless when silver is taken into account, and again the value of silver disappears in comparison with gold, and gold itself is disregarded when compared with precious stones, and yet a quantity of precious stones however splendid are outdone by the brightness of a single pearl, so all those merits of holiness, although they are not merely good and useful for the present life, but also secure the gift of eternity, yet if they are compared with the merit of Divine contemplation, will be considered trifling and so to speak,fit to be sold. And to support this illustration by the authority of Scripture, does not Scripture declare of all things in general which were created by God, and say: \"And behold everything that God had made was very good;\" and again: \"And things that God hath made are all good in their season\"?[fn-65-P6538_2335579:8-nf] These things then which in the present time are termed not simply and solely good, but emphatically \"very good\" (for they are really convenient for us while living in this world,either for purposes of life, or for remedies for the body, or by reason of some unknown usefulness, or else they are indeed \"very good,\" because they enable us \"to see the invisible things of God from the creatures of the world, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead,\"[fn-65-P6539_2336102:9-nf] from this great and orderly arrangement of the fabric of the world; and to contemplate themfrom the existence of everything in it), yet none of these things will keep the name of good if they are regarded in the light of that world to come, where no variation of good things, and no loss of true blessedness need be feared. The bliss of which world is thus described: \"The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days.\"[fn-65-P6540_2336616:10-nf] These things then which are great and wondrous to be gazed on, and marvellous, will at once appear as vanity if they are compared with the future promises from faith; as David says: \"They all shall wax old as a garment, and as a vesture shall Thou change them, and they shall be changed. But Thouart the same, and Thy years shall not fail.\"[fn-65-P6541_2336976:11-nf] Because then there is nothing of itself enduring, nothing unchangeable, nothing good but Deity alone, while every creature, to obtain the blessing of eternity and immutability, aimsat this not by its own nature but by participation of its Creator, and His grace, they cannotmaintain their character for goodness when compared with their Creator.","title":"XXIII.

For after making mention of the creation, he naturally speaks of the Framer's Power as seen in it, which Power, I say, is the Word of God, by whom all things have been made. If indeed the creation is sufficient of itself alone, without the Son, to make God known, see that you fill not, from thinking that without the Son it has come to be. But if through the Son it has come to be, and `in Him all things consist[fn-53-P5356_2101724:69-nf] ,' it must follow that he who contemplates the creation rightly, is contemplating also the Word who framed it, and through Him begins to apprehend the Father[fn-53-P5357_2101899:70-nf] .

Thus, if Isaiah says, `The Everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth[fn-53-P5362_2102940:75-nf] ;' and Susanna said, `O Everlasting God[fn-53-P5363_2102997:76-nf] ;' and Baruch wrote, `I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days,' and shortly after, `My hope is in the Everlasting, that He will save you, and joy is come unto me from the Holy One[fn-53-P5364_2103200:77-nf] ;' yet forasmuch as the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, `Who being the radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Person[fn-53-P5365_2103355:78-nf] ;' and David too in the eighty-ninth Psalm, `And the brightness of the Lord be upon us,' and, `In Thy Light shall we see Light[fn-53-P5366_2103498:79-nf] ,' who has so little sense as to doubt of the eternity of the Son[fn-53-P5367_2103595:80-nf] ? for when did man see light without the brightness of its radiance, that he may say of the Son, `There was once, when He was not,' or `Before His generation He was not.'

For the Son of God indeed, being Himself the Word, is Lord of all; but we once were subject from the first to the slavery of corruption and the curse of the Law, then by degrees fashioning for ourselves things that were not, we served, as says the blessed Apostle, `them which by nature are no Gods[fn-58-P5894_2352927:76-nf] ,' and, ignorant of the true God, we preferred things that were not to the truth; but afterwards, as the ancient people when oppressed in Egypt groaned, so, when we too had the Law `engrafted[fn-58-P5895_2353136:77-nf] ' in us, and according to the unutterable sighings[fn-58-P5896_2353205:78-nf] of the Spirit made our intercession, `O Lord our God, take possession of us[fn-58-P5897_2353301:79-nf] ,' then, as `He became for a house of refuge' and a `God and defence,' so also He became our Lord. Nor did He then begin to be, but we began to have Him for our Lord. For upon this, God being good and Father of the Lord, in pity, and desiring to be known by all, makes His own Son put on Him a human body and become man, and be called Jesus, that in this body offering Himself for all, He might deliver all from false worship and corruption, and might Himself become of all Lord and King. His becoming therefore in this way Lord and King, this it is that Peter means by, `He hath made Him Lord,' and `hath sent Christ;' as much as to say, that the Father in making Him man (for to be made belongs to man), did not simply make Him man, but has made Him in order to His being Lord of all men, and to His hallowing all through the Anointing. For though the Word existing in the form of God took a servant's form, yet the assumption of the flesh did not make a servant[fn-58-P5898_2354290:80-nf] of the Word, who was by nature Lord; but rather, not only was it that emancipation of all humanity which takes place by the Word, but that very Word who was by nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by means of a servant's form been made Lord of all and Christ, that is, in order to hallow all by the Spirit. And as God, when `becoming a God and defence,' and saying, `I will be a God to them,' does not then become God more than before, nor then begins to become God, but, what He ever is, that He then becomes to those who need Him, when it pleaseth Him, so Christ also being by nature Lord and King everlasting, does not become Lord more than He was at the time He is sent forth, nor then begins to be Lord and King, but what He is ever, that He then is made according to the flesh; and, having redeemed all, He becomes thereby again Lord of quick and dead. For Him henceforth do all things serve, and this is David's meaning in the Psalm, `The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool[fn-58-P5899_2355618:81-nf] .'

Wherefore I am in wonder how, whereas God is One, these men introduce, after their private notions, many images and wisdoms and words[fn-60-P6093_2427051:240-nf] , and say that the Father's proper and natural Word is other than the Son, by whom He even made the Son[fn-60-P6094_2427599:241-nf] and that He who is really Son is but notionally[fn-60-P6095_2427839:242-nf] called Word, as vine, and way, and door, and tree of life; and that He is called Wisdom also in name, the proper and true Wisdom of the Father, which coexist ingenerately[fn-60-P6096_2428124:243-nf] with Him, being other than the Son, by which He even made the Son, and named Him Wisdom as partaking of it. This they have not confined to words, but Arius composed in his Thalia, and the Sophist Asterius wrote, what we have stated above, as follows: `Blessed Paul said not that he preached Christ, the Power of God or the Wisdom of God,' but without the addition of the article, `God's power' and `God's wisdom[fn-60-P6097_2428590:244-nf] ,' thus preaching that the proper Power of God Himself which is natural to Him, and co-existent in Him ingenerately, is something besides, generative indeed of Christ, and creative of the whole world, concerning which he teaches in his Epistle to the Romans thus,-`The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead[fn-60-P6098_2429034:245-nf] .'

And he teaches that there is another power and wisdom of God, manifested through Christ. And shortly after the same Asterius says, `However His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without beginning and ingenerate, the same must surely be one. For there are many wisdoms which are one by one created by Him, of whom Christ is the first-born and only-begotten; all however equally depend on their Possessor. And all the powers are rightly called His who created and uses them:-as the Prophet says that the locust, which came to be a divine punishment of human sins, was called by God Himself not only a power, but a great power; and blessed David in most of the Psalms invites, not the Angels alone, but the Powers to praise God.'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"42.

For as of the Son of God, considered as the Word, our word is an image, so of the same Son considered as Wisdom is the wisdom which is implanted in us an image; in which wisdom we, having the power of knowledge and thought, become recipients of the All-framing Wisdom; and through It we are able to know Its Father. `For he who hath the Son,' saith He, `hath the Father also;' and `he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me[fn-64-P6445_2564256:538-nf] .'

For if it be not so, but the Word is a creature and a work out of nothing, either He is not True God because He is Himself one of the creatures, or if they name Him God from regard for the Scriptures, they must of necessity say that there are two Gods[fn-66-P6638_2635988:122-nf] , one Creator, the other creature, and must serve two Lords, one Unoriginate, and the other originate and a creature; and must have two faiths, one in the True God, and the other in one who is made and fashioned by themselves and called God. And it follows of necessity in so great blindness, that, when they worship the Unoriginate, they renounce the originate, and when they come to the creature, they turn from the Creator. For they cannot see the One in the Other, because their natures and operations are foreign and distinct[fn-66-P6639_2636972:123-nf] . And with such sentiments, they will certainly be going on to more gods, for this will be the essay[fn-66-P6640_2637091:124-nf] of those who revolt from the One God. Wherefore then, when the Arians have these speculations and views, do they not rank themselves with the Gentiles? for they too, as these, worship the creature rather than God the Creator of all[fn-66-P6641_2637360:125-nf] , and though they shrink from the Gentile name, in order to deceive the unskilful, yet they secretly hold a like sentiment with them. For their subtle saying which they are accustomed to urge, We say not two `Unoriginates[fn-66-P6642_2637896:126-nf] ,' they plainly say to deceive the simple; for in their very professing `We say not two Unoriginates,' they imply two Gods, and these with different natures, one originate and one Unoriginate. And though the Greeks worship one Unoriginate and many originate, but these one Unoriginate and one originate, this is no differ- ence from them; for the God whom they call originate is one out of many, and again the many gods of the Greeks have the same nature with this one, for both he and they are creatures. Unhappy are they, and the more for that their hurt is from thinking against Christ; for they have fallen from the truth, and are greater traitors than the Jews in denying the Christ, and they wallow[fn-66-P6643_2638626:127-nf] with the Gentiles, hateful[fn-66-P6644_2638751:128-nf] as they are to God, worshipping the creature and many deities. For there is One God, and not many, and One is His Word, and not many; for the Word is God, and He alone has the Form[fn-66-P6645_2638975:129-nf] of the Father. Being then such, the Saviour Himself troubled the Jews with these words, `The Father Himself which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His Form; and ye have not His Word abiding in you; for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not[fn-66-P6646_2641125:130-nf] .' Suitably has He joined the `Word' to the `Form,' to shew that the Word of God is Himself Image and Expression and Form of His Father; and that the Jews who did not receive Him who spoke to them, thereby did not receive the Word, which is the Form of God. This too it was that the Patriarch Jacob having seen, received a blessing from Him and the name of Israel instead of Jacob, as divine Scripture witnesses, saying, `And as he passed by the Form of God, the Sun rose upon him[fn-66-P6647_2641625:131-nf] .'

It will not lead me to give less importance to the creation of the universe, that the servant of God, Moses, is silent as to shapes; he has not said that the earth is a hundred and eighty thousand furlongs in circumference; he has not measured into what extent of air its shadow projects itself whilst the sun revolves around it, nor stated how this shadow, casting itself upon the moon, produces eclipses. He has passed over in silence, as useless, all that is unimportant for us. Shall I then prefer foolish wisdom to the oracles of the Holy Spirit? Shall I not rather exalt Him who, not wishing to fill our minds with these vanities, has regulated all the economy of Scripture in view of the edification and the making perfect of our souls? It is this which those seem to me not to have understood, who, giving themselves up to the distorted meaning of allegory, have undertaken to give a majesty of their own invention to Scripture. It is to believe themselves wiser than the Holy Spirit, and to bring forth their own ideas under a pretext of exegesis.

But what is this, \"He shall go in and out, and find pasture\"? To enter indeed into the Church by Christ the door, is eminently good; but to go out of the Church, as this same John the evangelist saith in his epistle, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us,\"[fn-19-P1959_1221315:28-nf] is certainly otherwise than good. Such a going out could not then be commended by the good Shepherd, when He said, \"And he shall go in and out, and find pasture.\" There is therefore not only some sort of entrance, but some outgoing also that is good, by the good door, which is Christ. But what is that praiseworthy and blessed outgoing? I might say, indeed, that we enter when we engage in some inward exercise of thought; and go out, when we take to some active work without: and since, as the apostle saith, Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith,[fn-19-P1960_1221887:29-nf] to enter by Christ is to give ourselves to thought in accordance with that faith; but to go out by Christ is, in accordance also with that same faith, to take to outside works, that is to say, in the presence of others. Hence, also, we read in a psalm, \"Man goeth forth to his work;\"[fn-19-P1961_1222191:30-nf] and the Lord Himself saith, \"Let your works shine before men.\"[fn-19-P1962_1222273:31-nf] But I am better pleased that the Truth Himself, like a good Shepherd, and therefore a good Teacher, hath in a certain measure reminded us how we ought to understand His words, \"He shall go in and out, and find pasture,\" when He added in the sequel, \"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" For He seems to me to have meant, That they may have life in coming in, and have it more abundantly at their departure. For no one can pass out by the door-that is, by Christ-to that eternal life which shall be open to the sight, unless by the same door-that is, by the same Christ-he has entered His church, which is His fold, to the temporal life, which is lived in faith. Therefore, He saith, \"I am come that they may have life,\" that is, faith, which worketh by love;[fn-19-P1963_1223165:32-nf] by which faith they enter the fold that they may live, for the just liveth by faith:[fn-19-P1964_1223268:33-nf] \"and that they may have it more abundantly,\" who, enduring unto the end, pass out by this same door, that is, by the faith of Christ; for as true believers they die, and will have life more abundantly when they come whither the Shepherd hath preceded them, where they shall die no more. Although, therefore, there is no want of pasture even here in the fold,-for we may understand the words \"and shall find pasture\" as referring to both, that is, both to their going in and their going out,-yet there only will they find the true pasture. where they shall be filled who hunger and thirst after righteousness,[fn-19-P1965_1223893:34-nf] -such pasture as was found by him to whom it was said, \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\"[fn-19-P1966_1224009:35-nf] But how He Himself is the door, and Himself the Shepherd, so that He also may in a certain respect be understood as going in and out by Himself, and who is the porter, it would be too long to inquire to-day, and, according to the grace given us by Himself, to unfold in the way of dissertation.

For heretics, corrupt in their mind, untried in the faith, rising against the truth, violently persecute the Church, and of the brethren, some are scourged and others torn with stripes, and hardest of all, their insults reach even to the Bishops. Nevertheless, it is not becoming, on this account, that we should neglect the feast. But we should especially remember it, and not at all forget its commemoration from time to time. Now the unbelievers do not consider that there is a season for feasts, because they spend all their lives in revelling and follies; and the feasts which they keep are an occasion of grief rather than of joy.

For since he knew the persecutions that befel those who chose to live in godliness, he wished his disciples to meditate beforehand on the difficulties connected with godliness; that when trials should come, and affliction arise, they might be able to bear them easily, as having been exercised in these things.

Whence came it that these men, who had quitted their country without having seen Jesus, and had not noticed anything in His looks to enforce such systematic adoration, observed this method in offering their gifts? unless it were that besides the appearance of the star, which attracted their bodily eyes, the more refulgent rays of truth taught their hearts that before they started on their toilsome road, they must understand that He was signified to Whom was owed in gold royal honour, in incense Divine adoration, in myrrh the acknowledgment of mortality.

And when Matthew speaks of \"the Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham[fn-10-P1082_252595:12-nf] ,\" He might have also sought out the instruction afforded by the statements of the Apostles. And reading in the Epistle to the Romans, \"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called an Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of God, which He had promised before by His prophets in the Holy Scripture concerning His son, who was made unto Him[fn-10-P1083_252946:13-nf] of the seed of David after the flesh[fn-10-P1084_253008:14-nf] ,\" he might have bestowed a loyal carefulness upon the pages of the prophets. And finding the promise of God who says to Abraham, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blest[fn-10-P1085_253196:15-nf] ,\" to avoid all doubt as to the reference of this seed, he might have followed the Apostle when He says, \"To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not and to seeds, as if in many, but as it in one, and to thy seed which is Christ[fn-10-P1086_253462:16-nf] .\" Isaiah's prophecy also he might have grasped by a closer attention to what he says, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son and they shall call His name Immanuel,\" which is interpreted \"God with us[fn-10-P1087_253690:17-nf] .\" And the same prophet's words he might have read faithfully. \"A child is born to us, a Son is given to us, whose power is upon His shoulder, and they shall call His name the Angel of the Great Counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the age to come[fn-10-P1088_254022:18-nf] .\" And then he would not speak so erroneously as to say that the Word became flesh in such a way that Christ, born of the Virgin's womb, had the form of man, but had not the reality of His mother's body[fn-10-P1089_254570:19-nf] . Or is it possible that he thought our Lord Jesus Christ was not of our nature for this reason, that the angel, who was sent to the blessed Mary ever Virgin, says, \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: and therefore that Holy Thing also that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God[fn-10-P1090_255131:20-nf] ,\" on the supposition that as the conception of the Virgin was a Divine act, the flesh of the conceived did not partake of the conceiver's nature? But that birth so uniquely wondrous and so wondrously unique, is not to be understood in such wise that the properties of His kind were removed through the novelty of His creation. For though the Holy Spirit imparted fertility to the Virgin, yet a real body was received from her body; and, \"Wisdom building her a house[fn-10-P1091_255618:21-nf] ,\" \"the Word became flesh and dwelt in us[fn-10-P1092_255677:22-nf] ,\" that is, in that flesh which he took from man and which he quickened with the breath of a higher life[fn-10-P1093_255935:23-nf] .

Which is first in order, knowledge or faith ? I reply that generally, in the case of disciples, faith precedes knowledge. But, in our teaching, if any one asserts knowledge to come before faith, I make no objection; understanding knowledge so far as is within the bounds of human comprehension. In our lessons we must first believe that the letter a is said to us; then we learn the characters and their pronunciation, and last of all we get the distinct idea of the force of the letter. But in our belief about God, first comes the idea that God is. This we gather from His works. For, as we perceive His wisdom, His goodness, and all His invisible things from the creation of the world,[fn-54-P5471_1723326:2-nf] so we know Him. So, too, we accept Him as our Lord.

For she is of all cities the greatest and most famous, the mistress of the world and teeming with population.

But her chief decoration is her Faith, to which the Divine Apostle is a sure witness when he exclaims \"your faith is proclaimed in all the world[fn-13-P1399_340398:1-nf] ;\" and if immediately after receiving the seeds of the saving Gospel she bore such a weight of wondrous fruit, what words are sufficient to express the piety which is now found in her?
