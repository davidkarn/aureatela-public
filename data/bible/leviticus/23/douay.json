{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:\nThese are the feasts of the Lord, which you shall call holy.","Six days shall ye do work:  the seventh day, because it is the\nrest of the sabbath, shall be called holy.  You shall do no work on that\nday:  it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your habitations.","These also are the holy days of the Lord, which you must\ncelebrate in their seasons.","The first month, the fourteenth day of the month at evening, is\nthe phase of the Lord.","And the fifteenth day of the same month is the solemnity of the\nunleavened bread of the Lord.  Seven days shall you eat unleavened\nbread.","The first day shall be most solemn unto you, and holy:  you shall\ndo no servile work therein.","But you shall offer sacrifice in fire to the Lord seven days.  And\nthe seventh day shall be more solemn, and more holy:  and you shall do\nno servile work therein.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:\nWhen you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, and\nshall reap your corn, you shall bring sheaves of ears, the firstfruits\nof your harvest to the priest.","Who shall lift up the sheaf before the Lord, the next day after\nthe sabbath, that it may be acceptable for you, and shall sanctify it.","And on the same day that the sheaf is consecrated, a lamb\nwithout blemish of the first year shall be killed for a holocaust of\nthe Lord.","And the libations shall be offered with it:  two tenths of flour\ntempered with oil, for a burnt offering of the Lord, and a most sweet\nodour.  Libations also of wine, the fourth part of a hin.","You shall not eat either bread, or parched corn, or frumenty or\nthe harvest, until the day that you shall offer thereof to your God.  It\nis a precept for ever throughout your generations, and all your\ndwellings.","You shall count therefore from the morrow after the sabbath,\nwherein you offered the sheaf of firstfruits, seven full weeks.","Even unto the morrow after the seventh week be expired, that is\nto say, fifty days:  and so you shall offer a new sacrifice to the Lord.","Out of all your dwellings, two loaves of the firstfruits, of two\ntenths of flour leavened, which you shall bake for the firstfruits of\nthe Lord.","And you shall offer with the loaves seven lambs without blemish\nof the first year, and one calf from the herd, and they shall be for a\nholocaust with their two rams:  and they shall be for a holocaust with\ntheir libations for a most sweet odour to the Lord.","You shall offer also a buck goat for sin, and two lambs of the\nfirst year for sacrifices of peace offerings.","And when the priest hath lifted them up with the loaves of the\nfirstfruits before the Lord, they shall fall to his use.","And you shall call this day most solemn, and most holy.  You\nshall do no servile work therein.  It shall be an everlasting ordinance\nin all your dwellings and generations.","And when you reap the corn of your land, you shall not cut it to\nthe very ground:  neither shall you gather the ears that remain.  But you\nshall leave them for the poor and for the strangers.  I am the Lord your\nGod.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Say to the children of Israel:  The seventh month, on the first\nday of the month, you shall keep a sabbath, a memorial, with the sound\nof trumpets, and it shall be called holy.","You shall do no servile work therein, and you shall offer a\nholocaust to the Lord.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Upon the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the day of\natonement.  It shall be most solemn, and shall be called holy:  and you\nshall await your souls on that day, and shall offer a holocaust to the\nLord.","You shall do no servile work in the time of this day:  because it\nis a day of propitiation, that the Lord your God may be merciful unto\nyou.","Every soul that is not afflicted on this day, shall perish from\namong his people.","And every soul that shall do any work, the same will I destroy\nfrom among his people.","You shall do no work therefore on that day:  it shall be an\neverlasting ordinance unto you in all your generations, and dwellings.","It is a sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls\nbeginning on the ninth day of the month.  From evening until evening you\nshall celebrate your sabbaths.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Say to the children of Israel:  From the fifteenth day of this\nsame seventh month, shall be kept the feast of tabernacles, seven days\nto the Lord.","The first day shall be called most solemn and most holy:  you\nshall do no servile work therein.  And seven days you shall offer\nholocausts to the Lord.","The eighth day also shall be most solemn and most holy:  and you\nshall offer holocausts to the Lord.  For it is the day of assembly and\ncongregation.  You shall do no servile work therein.","These are the feasts of the Lord which you shall call most\nsolemn and most holy, and shall offer on them oblations to the Lord:\nholocausts and libations according to the rite of every day.","Besides the sabbaths of the Lord, and your gifts, and those\nthings that you offer by vow, or which you shall give to the Lord\nvoluntarily.","So from the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you shall\nhave gathered in all the fruits of your land, you shall celebrate the\nfeast of the Lord seven days.  On the first day and the eighth shall be\na sabbath:  that is a day of rest.","And you shall take to you on the first day the fruits of the\nfairest tree, and branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees,\nand willows of the brook:  And you shall rejoice before the Lord your\nGod.","And you shall keep the solemnity thereof seven days in the year.\nIt shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations.  In the\nseventh month shall you celebrate this feast.","And you shall dwell in bowers seven days.  Every one that is of\nthe race of Israel, shall dwell in tabernacles:","That your posterity may know, that I made the children of Israel\nto dwell in tabernacles, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.\nI am the Lord your God.","And Moses spoke concerning the feasts of the Lord to the\nchildren of Israel."]}
