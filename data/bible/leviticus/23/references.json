He might also have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that even here too He fulfilled a Psalm: \"He who did eat bread with me hath lifted up[fn-69-P6950_2021488:1593-nf] his heel against me.\"[fn-69-P6951_2021561:1594-nf] And without a price might He have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no doubt have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, \"The righteous one did they sell for silver.\"[fn-69-P6952_2022008:1595-nf] The very amount and the destination[fn-69-P6953_2022066:1596-nf] of the money, which on Judas' remorse was recalled from its first purpose of a fee,[fn-69-P6954_2022167:1597-nf] and appropriated to the purchase of a potter's field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah:[fn-69-P6955_2022313:1598-nf] \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued[fn-69-P6956_2023536:1599-nf] and gave them for the potter's field.\" When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it His own feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, \"This is my body,\"[fn-69-P6957_2024134:1600-nf] that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body.[fn-69-P6958_2024319:1601-nf] An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say, ) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of Marcion's theory of a phantom body,[fn-69-P6959_2024703:1602-nf] that bread should have been crucified!But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon,[fn-69-P6960_2024876:1603-nf] which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: \"I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that[fn-69-P6961_2025229:1604-nf] they devised a device against me, saying, Let us cast the tree upon His bread,\"[fn-69-P6962_2025396:1605-nf] which means, of course, the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the ancient prophecies,[fn-69-P6963_2025681:1606-nf] He declared plainly enough what He meant by the bread, when He called the bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the new testament to be sealed \"in His blood,\"[fn-69-P6964_2026008:1607-nf] affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, \"Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are thy garments red, and thy raiment as his who cometh from the treading of the full winepress? \"[fn-69-P6965_2026727:1608-nf] The prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way to His passion, clad in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer therein, He represents the bleeding condition of His flesh under the metaphor of garments dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and crushing process of the wine-press, from which the labourers descend reddened with the wine-juice, like men stained in blood. Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,[fn-69-P6966_2027407:1609-nf] saying, \"He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes\"[fn-69-P6967_2027506:1610-nf] -in His garments and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine. Thus did He now consecrate His blood in wine, who then (by the patriarch) used the figure of wine to describe His blood.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":23,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_37_book_iii_of_the_canonical_system_of_the_daily_prayers_and_psalms_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But we ought to know this, too, that on Sunday only one office[fn-21-P2194_945907:39-nf] is celebrated before dinner, at which, out of regard for the actual service[fn-21-P2195_945995:40-nf] and the Lord's communion, they usea more solemn and a longer service of Psalms and prayers and lessons, and so consider that Tierce and Sext are included in it.

But this was done providentially, that he should also depart with bonds. \"Unto bonds,\" he says, \"as an evil doer.\" (1 Tim. ii. 9.) For if his Lord \"was reckoned among the transgressors\" (Mark xv. 28), much more he: but as the Lord did not share with them in their character, so neither did Paul. For in this is seen the marvellous thing, the being mixed up with such, and vet receiving no harm from them. \"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia;one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. And the next day we touched at Sidon.\" (ch. xxvii. 1-3.) See how far Aristarchus also accompanies Paul. To good and useful purpose is Aristarchus present, as he would take back the report of all to Macedonia. \"And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. Julius gave Paul liberty,\" it says, acting \"courteously, that he might refresh himself;\" as it was but natural that he should be much the worse from his bonds and the fear, and the being dragged hither and thither. See how the writer does not hide this either, that Paul wished \"to refresh himself. And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.\" (v. 4.) Again trials, again contrary winds. See how the life of the saints is thus interwoven throughout: escaped from the court of justice, they fall in with shipwreck and storm. \"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.\" (v. 5, 6.) \"A ship of Alexandria,\" it says. It is likely that both those (in the former ship) would bear to Asia the report of what had befallen Paul, and that these[fn-18-P1872_1871864:1-nf] would do the same in Lycia. See how God does not innovate or change the order of nature, but suffers them to sail into the unfavorable winds. But even so the miracle is wrought. That they may sail safely, He did not let them go out in the (open) sea, but they always sailed near the land. \"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; and, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called the fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. Now when much time was spent, andwhen sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them.\" (v. 7-9.) By \"the fast\" here, I suppose he means that of the Jews.[fn-18-P1873_1872676:2-nf] For they departed thence a long time after the Pentecost, so that it was much about midwinter that they arrived at the coasts of Crete. And this too was no slight miracle, that they also should be saved on his account. \"Paul admonished them, and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the southwest and northwest. And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close to Crete. But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.[fn-18-P1874_1873903:3-nf] And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive\" (R. V. \"were driven.\") (v. 10-15.) Paul therefore advised them to remain, and he foretells what would come of it:but they, being in a hurry, and being prevented by the place, wished to winter at Phenice. Mark then the providential ordering of the events: first indeed, \"when the south wind blew softly, supposing they had obtained their purpose,\" they loosed the vessel, and came orth; then when the wind bore down upon them, they gave way to it driving them, and were with difficulty saved. \"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands,[fn-18-P1875_1875680:4-nf] strake sail,[fn-18-P1876_1875915:5-nf] and so were driven. And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away. But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.\" (v. 16-21.) Then after so great a storm he does not speak as insultingly over them, but as wishing that at any rate he might be believed for the future. Wherefore also he alleges what had taken place for a testimony of the truth of what was about to be said by him. \"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss or any man's life among you, but of the ship. For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.\" (v. 22-26.) And he foretells two things; both that they must be cast upon an island, and that though the ship would be lost, those who were in it should be saved-which thing he spoke not of conjecture, but of prophecy-and that he \"must be brought before Caesar.\" But this that he says, \"God hath given thee all,\" is not spoken boastfully, but in the wish to win those who were sailing in the ship: for (he spoke thus), not that they might feel themselves bound to him, but that they might believe what he was saying. \"God hath given thee;\" as much (as to say), They are worthy indeed of death, since they would not listen to thee:however, this is done out of favor to thee. \"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; and sounded, and found it twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. Then fearing lest they should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.\" (v. 27-32.) The sailors however, were about to escape, having no faith in what was said: but the centurion does believe Paul, For he says, If these flee, \"ye cannot be saved:\" so saying, not on this account, but that he might restrain them, and the prophecy might not fall to the ground. See how as in a church they are instructed by the calmness of Paul's behavior, how' he saved them out of the very midst of the dangers. And it is of providential ordering that Paul is disbelieved, that after proof of the facts, he might be believed: which accordingly was the case. And he exhorts them again to take some meat, and they do as he bids them, and he takes some first, to persuade them not by word, but also by act, that the storm did them no harm, but rather was a benefit to their souls. \"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing.\" (v. 33.) (b) And how, say you, did they go without food, having taken nothing? how did they bear it? Their fear possessed them, and did not let them fall into a desire of food, being, as they were, at the point of extreme jeopardy; (f) but they had no care for food. \"Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat,\" (v. 34-36) seeing that there was no question about their lives being saved. (d) \"And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.\" (v. 37-41.) \"They made towards shore,\" having given the rudder-handles to the wind: for oftentimes they do it not in this way. They were borne along, having loosed the rigging, i.e. the sails. \"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves;\" for when there is a strong wind, this is the consequence, the stern bearing the brunt (of the storm). (a) \"And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.\" (v. 42.) Again the devil tries to hinder the prophecy, and they had a mind to kill some, but the centurion suffered them not, that he might save Paul, so much was the centurion attached to him. \"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land: and the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.\" (v. 43, 44.) \"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.\" (ch. xxviii. 1.) Do you mark what good came of the storm? Why then it was no mark of their being forsaken, that the storm came upon them. (c) Now this that happened was in consequence of the season of the year; but the wonder is greater, that at such a season they were saved from the midst of the dangers, both he, and for his sake the rest, (e) and this too in the Hadriatic. There were two hundred and seventy-six souls in all: no small matter this also, ifindeed they believed. The voyage was at an unseasonable time. (g) It is natural to suppose they would ask the reason why they were sailing, and would learn all. Nor was it for nothing that the voyage was so protracted; it afforded Paul an opportunity for teaching.","title":"Homily LIII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":23,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_49_tractate_xliv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9. \"They brought to the Pharisees him who had been blind.

For this is the spiritual Sabbath, to have no sin. In fact, brethren, it is of this that God admonishes us, when He commends the Sabbath to our notice: \"Thou shalt do no servile work\"[fn-18-P1896_1184442:19-nf] These are God's words when commending the Sabbath, \"Thou shalt do no servile work.\" Now ask the former lessons, what is meant by servile work;[fn-18-P1897_1184606:20-nf] and listen to the Lord: \"Every one that committeth sin is the servant of sin.\"[fn-18-P1898_1184704:21-nf] But these men, neither seeing, as I said, nor anointed, kept the Sabbath carnally, and profaned it spiritually. \"Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?\" These were the anointed ones. \"And there was a division among them.\" The day had divided between the light and the darkness. \"They say then unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him who hath opened thine eyes?\" What is thy feeling about him? what is thine opinion? what is thy judgment?

For it is at all times suitable and in agreement with both the New and Old Testament, that the Divine Mercy should be sought with chastisement both of mind and body, because nothing is more effectual in prevailing with God than that a man should judge himself and never cease from asking pardon, knowing that he is never without fault For human nature has this flaw in itself, not planted there by the Creator but contracted by the transgressor[fn-41-P4151_1063873:2-nf] , and transmitted to his posterity by the law of generation[fn-41-P4152_1063948:3-nf] , so that from the corruptible body springs that which may corrupt the soul also. Hence although the inner man be now reborn in Christ and rescued from the bonds of captivity, it has unceasing conflicts with the flesh, and has to endure resistance in seeking to restrain vain desires. And in this strife such perfect victory is not easily obtained that even those habits which must be broken off do not still encumber us, and those vices which must be slain do not wound. However wisely and prudently the mind presides as judge over the outer senses, yet even amid the pains it takes to rule and the limits it imposes on the appetites of the flesh, the temptation is always too close at hand. For who so abstracts himself from pleasure or pain of body that his mind is not affected by that which delights or racks it from without? Joy and sorrow are inseparable from a man: no part of him is free from the kindlings of wrath, the over-powerings of delight, the castings down of affliction. And what turning away from sin can there be, where ruler and ruled alike are liable to the same passions?
