{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:  If a\nwoman having received seed shall bear a man child, she shall be unclean\nseven days, according to the days of separation of her flowers.","And on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised:","But she shall remain three and thirty days in the blood of her\npurification.  She shall touch no holy thing:  neither shall she enter\ninto the sanctuary, until the days of her purification, be fulfilled.","But if she shall bear a maid child, she shall be unclean two\nweeks, according to the custom of her monthly courses.  And she shall\nremain in the blood of her purification sixty-six days.","And when the days of her purification are expired, for a son, or\nfor a daughter, she shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the\ntestimony, a lamb of a year old for a holocaust, and a young pigeon or\na turtle for sin:  and shall deliver them to the priest.","Who shall offer them before the Lord, and shall pray for her:  and\nso she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.  This is the law\nfor her that beareth a man child or a maid child.","And if her hand find not sufficiency, and she is not able to\noffer a lamb, she shall take two turtles, or two young pigeons, one for\na holocaust, and another for sin:  and the priest shall pray for her,\nand so she shall be cleansed."]}
