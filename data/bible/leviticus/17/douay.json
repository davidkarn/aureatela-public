{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel,\nsaying to them:  This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded,\nsaying:","Any man whosoever of the house of Israel, if he kill an ox, or a\nsheep, or a goat in the camp, or without the camp,","And offer it not at the door of the tabernacle an oblation to the\nLord, shall be guilty of blood.  As if he had shed blood, so shall he\nperish from the midst of his people.","Therefore the children of Israel shall bring to the priest their\nvictims, which they kill in the field, that they may be sanctified to\nthe Lord before the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:  and they\nmay sacrifice them for peace offerings to the Lord.","And the priest shall pour the blood upon the altar of the Lord,\nat the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:  and shall burn the fat\nfor a sweet odour to the Lord.","And they shall no more sacrifice their victims to devils, with\nwhom they have committed fornication.  It shall be an ordinance for ever\nto them and to their posterity.","And thou shalt say to them:  The man of the house of Israel, and\nof the strangers who sojourn among you, that offereth a holocaust or a\nvictim,","And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the\ntestimony, that it may be offered to the Lord, shall perish from among\nhis people.","If any man whosoever of the house of Israel, and of the\nstrangers that sojourn among them, eat blood, I will set my face\nagainst his soul, and will cut him off from among his people.","Because the life of the flesh is in the blood:  and I have given\nit to you, that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your\nsouls, and the blood may be for an expiation of the soul.","Therefore I have said to the children of Israel:  No soul of you,\nnor of the strangers that sojourn among you, shall eat blood.","Any man whosoever of the children of Israel, and of the\nstrangers that sojourn among you, if by hunting or fowling, he take a\nwild beast or a bird, which is lawful to eat, let him pour out its\nblood, and cover it with earth.","For the life of all flesh is in the blood.  Therefore I said to\nthe children of Israel:  you shall not eat the blood of any flesh at\nall, because the life of the flesh is in the blood, and whosoever\neateth it, shall be cut off.","The soul that eateth that which died of itself, or has been\ncaught by a beast, whether he be one of your own country or a stranger,\nshall wash his clothes and himself with water, and shall be defiled\nuntil the evening:  and in this manner he shall be made clean.","But if he do not wash his clothes, and his body, he shall bear\nhis iniquity."]}
