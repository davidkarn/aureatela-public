For each individualis to be judged not by his personal importance but by the merits of his case. His wealth need not stand in the way of the rich man, if he makes a good use of it; and poverty can be no recommendation to the poor if in the midst of squalor and want he fails to keep clear of wrong doing. Proofs of these things are not wanting either in scriptural times or our own; for Abraham, in spite of his immense wealth, was \"the friend of God\"[fn-32-P3299_865807:2390-nf] and poor men are daily arrested and punished for their crimes by law. She whom I now address is both rich and poor so that she cannot say what she actually has. For it is not of her purse that I am speaking but of the purity of her soul. I do not know her face but I am well acquainted with her virtues; for report speaks well of her and her youth makes her chastity all the more commendable. By her grief for her young husband she has set an example to all wives; and by her resignation she has proved that she believes him not lost but gone before.

Nor may you excuse yourself on the score of your noble station and the responsibilities of wealth. Look at Pammachius and at Paulinus that presbyter of glowing faith both of whom have offered to the Lord not only their riches but themselves. In spite of the devil and his shuffling they have by no means given skin for skin, but have consecrated their own flesh and bones, yea and their very souls unto the Lord. Surely these may lead you to higher things both by their example and by their preaching, that is, by their deeds and words. You are of noble birth, so are they: but in Christ they are made nobler still. You are rich and held in repute, so once were they: but now instead of being rich and held in repute they are poor and obscure, yet, because it is for Christ's sake, they are really richer and more famous than ever. You too, it is true, shew yourself beneficent, you are said to minister to the wants of the saints, to entertain monks, and to present large sums of money to churches. This however is only the a b c of your soldiership. You despise money; the world's philosophers have done the same.

You may have spent your substance upon numbers of people, and a portion of your fellows may have reason to rejoice in your bounty; yet those who have received nothing at your hands are still more numerous. Neither the wealth of Darius nor the riches of Croesus would suffice to satisfy the wants of the world's poor. But if you once give yourself to the Lord and resolve to follow the Saviour in the perfection of apostolic virtue, then you will come to see what your place has hitherto been, and how you have lagged in the rear of Christ's army. Hardly had you begun to mourn for your dead daughters when the fear of Christ dried the tears of paternal affection upon your cheeks. It was a great triumph of faith, true. But how much greater was that won by Abraham who was content to slay his only son, of whom he had been told that he was to inherit the world, yet did not cease to hope that after death Isaac would live again.[fn-43-P4351_1189560:3101-nf] Jephthah too offered up his virgin daughter, and for this is placed by the apostle in the roll of the saints.[fn-43-P4352_1189699:3102-nf] I would not therefore have you offer to the Lord only what a thief may steal from you or an enemy fall upon, or a proscription confiscate, what is liable to fluctuations in value now going up and now down, what belongs to a succession of masters who follow each other as fast as in the sea wave follows wave, and-to say everything in a word-what, whether you like it or not, you must leave behind you when you die. Rather offer to God that which no enemy can carry off and no tyrant take from you, which will go down with you into the grave, nay on to the kingdom of heaven and the enchantments of paradise. You already build monasteries and support in the various islands of Dalmatia a large number of holy men. But you would do better still if you were to live among these holy men usa holy man yourself. \"Be ye holy, saith the Lord, for I am holy.\"[fn-43-P4353_1190590:3103-nf] The apostles boasted that they had left all things and had followed the Saviour.\"[fn-43-P4354_1190708:3104-nf] We do not read that they left anything except their ship and their nets; yet they were crowned with the approval of Him who was to be their judge.

And therefore, as he trained Israel by subjecting it to many plagues and afflictions, so does He now admonish you by sending you trials of different kinds. \"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.\"[fn-43-P4349_1188309:3099-nf] The poor widow did but cast two mites into the treasury; yet because she cast in all that she had it is said of her that she surpassed all the rich in offering gifts to God.[fn-43-P4350_1188505:3100-nf] Such gifts are valued not by their weight but by the good-will with which they are made. You may have spent your substance upon numbers of people, and a portion of your fellows may have reason to rejoice in your bounty; yet those who have received nothing at your hands are still more numerous. Neither the wealth of Darius nor the riches of Croesus would suffice to satisfy the wants of the world's poor. But if you once give yourself to the Lord and resolve to follow the Saviour in the perfection of apostolic virtue, then you will come to see what your place has hitherto been, and how you have lagged in the rear of Christ's army. Hardly had you begun to mourn for your dead daughters when the fear of Christ dried the tears of paternal affection upon your cheeks. It was a great triumph of faith, true. But how much greater was that won by Abraham who was content to slay his only son, of whom he had been told that he was to inherit the world, yet did not cease to hope that after death Isaac would live again.[fn-43-P4351_1189560:3101-nf] Jephthah too offered up his virgin daughter, and for this is placed by the apostle in the roll of the saints.[fn-43-P4352_1189699:3102-nf] I would not therefore have you offer to the Lord only what a thief may steal from you or an enemy fall upon, or a proscription confiscate, what is liable to fluctuations in value now going up and now down, what belongs to a succession of masters who follow each other as fast as in the sea wave follows wave, and-to say everything in a word-what, whether you like it or not, you must leave behind you when you die. Rather offer to God that which no enemy can carry off and no tyrant take from you, which will go down with you into the grave, nay on to the kingdom of heaven and the enchantments of paradise. You already build monasteries and support in the various islands of Dalmatia a large number of holy men. But you would do better still if you were to live among these holy men usa holy man yourself. \"Be ye holy, saith the Lord, for I am holy.\"[fn-43-P4353_1190590:3103-nf] The apostles boasted that they had left all things and had followed the Saviour.\"[fn-43-P4354_1190708:3104-nf] We do not read that they left anything except their ship and their nets; yet they were crowned with the approval of Him who was to be their judge.

In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God. Melchizedek also, \"the priest of the most high God,\" uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was chosen to the priesthood of God.[fn-20-P2065_704730:34-nf] Lot, withal, the brother[fn-20-P2066_704771:35-nf] of Abraham, proves that it was for the merits of righteousness, without observance of the law, that he was freed from the conflagration of the Sodomites.[fn-20-P2067_704969:36-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Of how deep guilt, then, adultery-which is likewise a matter of fornication, in accordance with its criminal function-is to be accounted, the Law of God first comes to hand to show us; if it is true, (as it is), that after interdicting the superstitious service of alien gods, and the making of idols themselves, after commending (to religious observance) the veneration of the Sabbath, after commanding a religious regard toward parents second (only to that) toward God, (that Law) laid, as the next substratum in strengthening and fortifying such counts, no other precept than \"Thou shall not commit adultery.\" For after spiritual chastity and sanctity followed corporeal integrity.

It was with a reference, in short, to this species of discipline that the caution was taken in the case of the leper: \"But if the speckled appearance shall have become efflorescent over the skin, and shall have covered the whole skin from the head even unto the feet through all the visible surface, then the priest, when he shall have seen, shall utterly cleanse him: since he hath wholly turned into white he is clean. But on the day that there shall have been seen in such an one quick colour, he is defiled.\"[fn-16-P1621_478029:258-nf] (The Law) would have the man who is wholly turned from the pristine habit of the flesh to the whiteness of faith-which (faith) is esteemed a defect and blemish in (the eyes of) the world[fn-16-P1622_478255:259-nf] -and is wholly made new, to be understood to be \"clean; \"as being no longer \"speckled,\" no longer dappled with the pristine and the new (intermixt). If, however, after the reversal (of the sentence of uncleanness), ought of the old nature shall have revived with its tendencies, that which was beginning to be thought utterly dead to sin in his flesh must again be judged unclean, and must no more be expiated by the priest. Thus adultery, sprouting again from the pristine stock, and wholly blemishing the unity of the new colour from which it had been excluded, is a defect that admits of no cleansing. Again, in the case of a house: if any spots and cavities in the party-walls had been reported to the priest, before he entered to inspect that house he bids all (its contents) be taken away from it; thus the belongings of the house would not be unclean. Then the priest, if, upon entering, he had found greenish or reddish cavities, and their appearance to the sight deeper down within the body of the party-wall, was to go out to the gate, and separate the house for a period within seven days. Then, upon returning on the seventh day, if he should have perceived the taint to have become diffused in the party-walls, he was to order those stones in which the taint of the leprosy had been to be extracted and cast away outside the city into an unclean place; and other stones, polished and sound, to be taken and replaced in the stead of the first, and the house to be plastered with other mortar.[fn-16-P1623_479776:260-nf] For, in coming to the High Priest of the Father-Christ-all impediments must first be taken away, in the space of a week, that the house which remains, the flesh and the soul, may be clean; and when the Word of God has entered it, and has found \"stains of red and green,\" forthwith must the deadly and sanguinary passions \"be extracted\" and \"cast away\" out of doors-for the Apocalypse withal has set \"death\" upon a \"green horse,\" but a \"warrior\" upon a \"red\"[fn-16-P1624_480262:261-nf] -and in their stead must be under-strewn stones polished and apt for conjunction, and firm,-such as are made (by God) into (sons) of Abraham,[fn-16-P1625_480430:262-nf] -that thus the man may be fit for God. But if, after the recovery and reformation, the priest again perceived in the same house ought of the pristine disorders and blemishes, he pronounced it unclean, and bade the timbers, and the stones, and all the structure of it, to be pulled down, and cast away into an unclean place.[fn-16-P1626_480794:263-nf] This will be the man-flesh and soul-who, subsequently to reformation, after baptism and the entrance of the priests, again resumes the scabs and stains of the flesh, and \"is case away outside the city into an unclean place,\"-\" surrendered,\" to wit, \"to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,\"-and is no more rebuilt in the Church after his ruin. So, too, with regard to lying with a female slave, who had been betrothed to an husband, but not yet redeemed, not yet set free: \"provision,\" says (the Law), shall be made for her, and she shall not die, because she was not yet manumitted for him for whom she was being kept.[fn-16-P1627_481441:264-nf] For flesh not yet manumitted to Christ, for whom it was being kept,[fn-16-P1628_481534:265-nf] used to be contaminated with impunity: so now, after manumission, it no more receives pardon.","title":"VII.

For as the term Father points to no difference of nature from the Son, his impiety, if he had brought his statement to a close here, would have had no support, seeing that the natural sense of the names Father and Son excludes the idea of their being alien in essence. But as it is, by employing the terms \"generate\" and \"ungenerate,\" since the contradictory opposition between them admits of no mean, just like that between \"mortal\" and \"immortal,\" \"rational\" and \"irrational,\" and all those terms which are opposed to each other by the mutually exclusive nature of their meaning,-by the use of these terms, I repeat, he gives free course to his profanity, so as to contemplate as existing in the \"generate\" with reference to the \"ungenerate\" the same difference which there is between \"mortal\" and \"immortal\": and even as the nature of the mortal is one, and that of the immortal another, and as the special attributes of the rational and of the irrational are essentially incompatible, just so he wants to make out that the nature of the ungenerate is one, and that of the generate another, in order to show that as the irrational nature has been created in subjection to the rational, so the generate is by a necessity of its being in a state of subordination to the ungenerate. For which reason he attaches to the ungenerate the name of \"Almighty,\" and this he does not apply to express providential operation, as the argument led the way for him in suggesting, but transfers the application of the word to arbitrary sovereignty, so as to make the Son to be a part of the subject and subordinate universe, a fellow-slave with all the rest to Him Who with arbitrary and absolute sovereignty controls all alike. And that it is with an eye to this result that he employs these argumentative distinctions, will be clearly established from the passage before us. For after those sapient and carefully-considered expressions, that He is not like either as Father to Father, or as Son to Son,-and yet there is no necessity that father should invariably be like father or son like son: for suppose there is one father among the Ethiopians, and another among the Scythians, and each of these has a son, the Ethiopian's son black, but the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge, yet none the more because each is a father does the Scythian turn black on the Ethiopian's account, nor does the Ethiopian's body change to white on account of the Scythian,-after saying this, however, according to his own fancy, Eunomius subjoins that \"He is like as Son to Father[fn-11-P1182_645287:176-nf] .\" But although such a phrase indicates kinship in nature, as the inspired Scripture attests in the case of Seth and Adam, our doctor, with but small respect for his intelligent readers, introduces his idle exposition of the title \"Son,\" defining Him to be the image and seal of the energy[fn-11-P1183_645670:177-nf] of the Almighty. \"For the Son,\" he says, \"is the image and seal of the energy of the Almighty.\" Let him who hath ears to hear first, I pray, consider this particular point-What is \"the seal of the energy\"? Every energy is contemplated as exertion in the party who exhibits it, and on the completion of his exertion, it has no independent existence. Thus, far example, the energy of the runner is the motion of his feet, and when the motion has stopped there is no longer any energy. So too about every pursuit the same may be said;-when the exertion of him who is busied about anything ceases, the energy ceases also, and has no independent existence, either when a person is actively engaged in the exertion he undertakes, or when he ceases from that exertion. What then does he tell us that the energy is in itself, which is neither essence, nor image, nor person? So he speaks of the Son as the similitude of the impersonal, and that which is like the non-existent surely has itself no existence at all. This is what his juggling with idle opinions comes to,-belief in nonentity! for that which is like nonentity surely itself is not. O Paul and John and all you others of the band of Apostles and Evangelists, who are they that arm their venomous tongues against your words? who are they that raise their frog-like croakings against your heavenly thunder? What then saith the son of thunder? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-11-P1184_647260:178-nf] .\" And what saith he that came after him, that other who had been within the heavenly temple, who in Paradise had been initiated into mysteries unspeakable? \"Being,\" he says, \"the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His person[fn-11-P1185_647522:179-nf] .\" What, after these have thus spoken, are the words of our ventriloquist[fn-11-P1186_647614:180-nf] ? \"The seal,\" quoth he, \"of the energy of the Almighty.\" He makes Him third after the Father, with that non-existent energy mediating between them, or rather moulded at pleasure by non-existence. God the Word, Who was in the beginning, is \"the seal of the energy\":-the Only-begotten God, Who is contemplated in the eternity of the Beginning of existent things, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-11-P1187_648087:181-nf] , Who sustains all things, by the word of His power[fn-11-P1188_648161:182-nf] , the creator of the ages, from Whom and through Whom and in Whom are all things[fn-11-P1189_648264:183-nf] , Who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and hath meted out heaven with the span, Who measureth the water in the hollow of his hand[fn-11-P1190_648423:184-nf] , Who holdeth in His hand all things that are, Who dwelleth on high and looketh upon the things that are lowly[fn-11-P1191_648561:185-nf] , or rather did look upon them to make all the world to be His footstool[fn-11-P1192_648662:186-nf] , imprinted by the footmark of the Word-the form of God[fn-11-P1193_648744:187-nf] is \"the seal\" of an \"energy.\" Is God then an energy, not a Person? Surely Paul when expounding this very truth says He is \"the express image,\" not of His energy, but \"of His Person.\" Is the Brightness of His glory a seal of the energy of God? Alas for his impious ignorance! What is there intermediate between God and His own form? and Whom does the Person employ as mediator with His own express image? and what can be conceived as coming between the glory and its brightness? But while there are such weighty and numerous testimonies wherein the greatness of the Lord of the creation is proclaimed by those who were entrusted with the proclamation of the Gospel, what sort of language does this forerunner of the final apostasy hold concerning Him? What says he? \"As image,\" he says, \"and seal of all the energy and power of the Almighty.\" How does he take upon himself to emend the words of the mighty Paul? Paul says that the Son is \"the Power of God[fn-11-P1194_649722:188-nf] \"; Eunomius calls Him \"the seal of a power,\" not the Power. And then, repeating his expression, what is it that he adds to his previous statement? He calls Him \"seal of the Father's works and words and counsels.\" To what works of the Father is He like? He will say, of course, the world, and all things that are therein. But the Gospel has testified that all these things are the works of the Only-begotten. To what works of theFather, then, was He likened? of what works was He made the seal? what Scripture ever entitled Him \"seal of the Father's works\"? But if any one should grant Eunomius the right to fashion his words at his own will, as he desires, even though Scripture does not agree with him, let him tell us what works of the Father there are of which he says that the Son was made the seal, apart from those that have been wrought by the Son. All things visible and invisible are the work of the Son: in the visible are included the whole world and all that is therein; in the invisible, the supramundane creation. What works of the Father, then, are remaining to be contemplated by themselves, over and above things visible and invisible, whereof he says that the Son was made the \"seal\"? Will he perhaps, when driven into a corner, return once more to the fetid vomit of heresy, and say that the Son is a work of the Father? How then does the Son come to be he seal of these works when He Himself, as Eunomius says, is the work of the Father? Or does he say that the same Person is at once a work and the likeness of a work? Let this be granted: let us suppose him to speak of the other works of which he says the Father was the creator, if indeed he intends us to understand likeness by the term \"seal.\" But what other \"words\" of the Father does Eunomius know, besides that Word Who was ever in the Father, Whom he calls a \"seal\"-Him Who is and is called the Word in the absolute, true, and primary sense? And to what counsels can he possibly refer, apart from the Wisdom of God, to which the Wisdom of God is made like, in becoming a \"seal\" of those counsels? Look at the want of discrimination and circumspection, at the confused muddle of his statement, how he brings the mystery into ridicule, without understanding either what he says or what he is arguing about.

Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.'[fn-25-P2539_1018195:80-nf] And in another passage: `I shall be blameless with Him.'[fn-25-P2540_1018271:81-nf] And yet again: `Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'[fn-25-P2541_1018379:82-nf] To the same effect it is written in Solomon: `The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.'\"[fn-25-P2542_1018531:83-nf] Now some of these passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, \"Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.\"[fn-25-P2543_1019210:84-nf] So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_13_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"74.

He commands you to forgive your brother, should he trespass against you even \"seven times.\"[fn-67-P6723_1966437:1382-nf] But that surely, is a small matter; for with the Creator there is a larger grace, when He sets no limits to forgiveness, indefinitely charging you \"not to bear any malice against your brother,\"[fn-67-P6724_1966654:1383-nf] and to give not merely to him who asks, but even to him who does not ask. For His will is, not that you should forgive[fn-67-P6725_1966796:1384-nf] an offence, but forget it. The law about lepers had a profound meaning as respects[fn-67-P6726_1966895:1385-nf] the forms of the disease itself, and of the inspection by the high priest.[fn-67-P6727_1966997:1386-nf] The interpretation of this sense it will be our task to ascertain. Marcion's labour, however, is to object to us the strictness[fn-67-P6728_1967158:1387-nf] of the law, with the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its enemy-forestalling[fn-67-P6729_1967269:1388-nf] its enactments even in His cure of the ten lepers. These He simply commanded to show themselves to the priest; \"and as they went, He cleansed them\"[fn-67-P6730_1967441:1389-nf] -without a touch, and without a word, by His silent power and simple will. Well, but what necessity was there for Christ, who had been once for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and sins, and had proved Himself such by His acts,[fn-67-P6731_1967709:1390-nf] to busy Himself with inquiries[fn-67-P6732_1967822:1391-nf] into the qualities and details of cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law in the person of Christ? If any pan of this healing was effected by Him in a way different from the law, He yet Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord may by Himself, or by His Son, produce after one manner, and after another manner by His servants the prophets, those proofs of His power and might especially, which (as excelling in glory and strength, because they are His own acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done by His servants. But enough has been already said on this point in a former passage.[fn-67-P6733_1968501:1392-nf] Now, although He said in a preceding chapter,[fn-67-P6734_1968579:1393-nf] that \"there were many lepers in lsrµl in the days of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian,\" yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a difference in the gods, as tending to the abasement[fn-67-P6735_1968858:1394-nf] of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence of Him who healed ten. For who can doubt that many might have been cured by Him who cured one more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But His main purpose in this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the pride of Israel, in that (although there were many lepers amongst them, and a prophet was not wanting to them) not one had been moved even by so conspicuous an example to betake himself to God who was working in His prophets. Forasmuch, then, as He was Himself the veritable[fn-67-P6736_1969446:1395-nf] High Priest of God the Father, He inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that Christ was the true distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of mankind. However, what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be done: \"Go,\" said He, \"show yourselves to the priests.\"[fn-67-P6737_1969957:1396-nf] Yet why this, if He meant to cleanse them first? Was it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to them that, having been cured already on the road, the law was now nothing to them, nor even the priests? Well, the matter must of course pass as it best may,[fn-67-P6738_1970242:1397-nf] if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these![fn-67-P6739_1970327:1398-nf] But there are certainly better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving of belief: how that they were cleansed on this account, because[fn-67-P6740_1970509:1399-nf] they were obedient, and went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the priests; and it is not to be believed that persons who observed the law could have found a cure from a god that was destroying the law. Why, however, did He not give such a command to the leper who first returned?[fn-67-P6741_1970858:1400-nf] Because Elisha did not in the case of Naaman the Syrian, and yet was not on that account less the Creator's agent? This is a sufficient answer.But the believer knows that there is a profounder reason. Consider, therefore, the true motives.[fn-67-P6742_1971139:1401-nf] The miracle was performed in the district of Samaria, to which country also belonged one of the lepers.[fn-67-P6743_1971260:1402-nf] Samaria, however, had revolted from Israel, carrying with it the disaffected nine tribes,[fn-67-P6744_1971374:1403-nf] which, having been alienated[fn-67-P6745_1971836:1404-nf] by the prophet Ahijah,[fn-67-P6746_1971877:1405-nf] Jeroboam settled in Samaria. Besides, the Samaritans were always pleased with the mountains and the wells of their ancestors. Thus, in the Gospel of John, the woman of Samaria, when conversing with the Lord at the well, says, \"No doubt[fn-67-P6747_1972153:1406-nf] Thou art greater,\" etc.; and again, \"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\"[fn-67-P6748_1972317:1407-nf] Accordingly, He who said, \"Woe unto them that trust in the mountain of Samaria,\"[fn-67-P6749_1972424:1408-nf] vouchsafing now to restore that very region, purposely requests the men \"to go and show themselves to the priests,\" because these were to be found only there where the temple was; submitting[fn-67-P6750_1972636:1409-nf] the Samaritan to the Jew, inasmuch as \"salvation was of the Jews,\"[fn-67-P6751_1972740:1410-nf] whether to the Israelite or the Samaritan. To the tribe of Judah, indeed, wholly appertained the promised Christ,[fn-67-P6752_1972876:1411-nf] in order that men might know that at Jerusalem were both the priests and the temple; that there also was the womb[fn-67-P6753_1973024:1412-nf] of religion, and its living fountain, not its mere \"well.\"[fn-67-P6754_1973102:1413-nf] Seeing, therefore, that they recognised[fn-67-P6755_1973178:1414-nf] the truth that at Jerusalem the law was to be fulfilled, He healed them. whose salvation was to come[fn-67-P6756_1973299:1415-nf] of faith[fn-67-P6757_1973332:1416-nf] without the ceremony of the law. Whence also, astonished that one only out of the ten was thankful for his release to the divine grace, He does not command him to offer a gift according to the law, because he had already paid his tribute of gratitude when \"he glorified God;[fn-67-P6758_1973631:1417-nf] for thus did the Lord will that the law's requirement should be interpreted. And yet who was the God to whom the Samaritan gave thanks, because thus far not even had an Israelite heard of another god? Who else but He by whom all had hitherto been healed through Christ? And therefore it was said to him, \"Thy faith hath made thee whole,\"[fn-67-P6759_1973994:1418-nf] because he had discovered that it was his duty to render the true oblation to Almighty God-even thanksgiving-in His true temple, and before His true High Priest Jesus Christ. But it is impossible either that the Pharisees should seem to have inquired of the Lord about the coming of the kingdom of the rival god, when no other god has ever yet been announced by Christ; or that He should have answered them concerning the kingdom of any other god than Him of whom they were in the habit of asking Him. \"The kingdom of God,\" He says, \"cometh not with observation; neither do they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-67-P6760_1974673:1419-nf] Now, who will not interpret the words \"within you\" to mean in your hand, within your power, if you hear, and do the commandment of God? If, however, the kingdom of God lies in His commandment, set before your mind Moses on the other side, according to our antitheses, and you will find the self-same view of the case.[fn-67-P6761_1975019:1420-nf] \"The commandment is not a lofty one,[fn-67-P6762_1975080:1421-nf] neither is it far off from thee. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, `Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 'nor is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, `Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 'But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy hands, to do it.\"[fn-67-P6763_1975526:1422-nf] This means, \"Neither in this place nor that place is the kingdom of God; for, behold, it is within you.\"[fn-67-P6764_1975658:1423-nf] And if the heretics, in their audacity, should contend that the Lord did not give an answer about His own kingdom, but only about the Creator's kingdom, concerning which they had inquired, then the following words are against them. For He tells them that \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected,\" before His coming,[fn-67-P6765_1976015:1424-nf] at which His kingdom will be really[fn-67-P6766_1976075:1425-nf] revealed. In this statement He shows that it was His own kingdom which His answer to them had contemplated, and which was now awaiting His own sufferings and rejection. But having to be rejected and afterwards to be acknowledged, and taken up[fn-67-P6767_1976344:1426-nf] and glorified, He borrowed the very word \"rejected\" from the passage, where, under the figure of a stone, His twofold manifestation was celebrated by David-the first in rejection, the second in honour: \"The stone,\" says He, \"which the builders rejected, is become the head-stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing.\"[fn-67-P6768_1976682:1427-nf] Now it would be idle, if we believed that God had predicted the humiliation, or even the glory, of any Christ at all, that He could have signed His prophecy for any but Him whom He had foretold under the figure of a stone, and a rock, and a mountain.[fn-67-P6769_1976958:1428-nf] If, however, He speaks of His own coming, why does He compare it with the days of Noe and of Lot,[fn-67-P6770_1977100:1429-nf] which were dark and terrible-a mild and gentle God as He is? Why does He bid us \"remember Lot's wife,\"[fn-67-P6771_1977230:1430-nf] who despised the Creator's command, and was punished for her contempt, if He does not come with judgment to avenge the infraction of His precepts? If He really does punish, like the Creator,[fn-67-P6772_1977445:1431-nf] if He is my Judge, He ought not to have adduced examples for the purpose of instructing me from Him whom He yet destroys, that He[fn-67-P6773_1977593:1432-nf] might not seem to be my instructor. But if He does not even here speak of His own coming, but of the coming of the Hebrew Christ,[fn-67-P6774_1977748:1433-nf] let us still wait in expectation that He will vouchsafe to us some prophecy of His own advent; meanwhile we will continue to believe that He is none other than He whom He reminds us of in every passage.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Then, turning to His disciples, He says: \"Woe unto him through whom offences come!

A trespassing brother He will have rebuked.[fn-67-P6720_1965390:1379-nf] If one failed in this duty of reproof, he in fact sinned, either because out of hatred he wished his brother to continue in sin, or else spared him from mistaken friendship,[fn-67-P6721_1965587:1380-nf] although possessing the injunction in Leviticus: \"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thy neighbor thou shalt seriously rebuke, and on his account shalt not contract sin.\"[fn-67-P6722_1965851:1381-nf] Nor is it to be wondered at, if He thus teaches who forbids your refusing to bring back even your brother's cattle, if you find them astray in the road; much more should you bring back your erring brother to himself. He commands you to forgive your brother, should he trespass against you even \"seven times.\"[fn-67-P6723_1966437:1382-nf] But that surely, is a small matter; for with the Creator there is a larger grace, when He sets no limits to forgiveness, indefinitely charging you \"not to bear any malice against your brother,\"[fn-67-P6724_1966654:1383-nf] and to give not merely to him who asks, but even to him who does not ask. For His will is, not that you should forgive[fn-67-P6725_1966796:1384-nf] an offence, but forget it.

Marcion's labour, however, is to object to us the strictness[fn-67-P6728_1967158:1387-nf] of the law, with the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its enemy-forestalling[fn-67-P6729_1967269:1388-nf] its enactments even in His cure of the ten lepers. These He simply commanded to show themselves to the priest; \"and as they went, He cleansed them\"[fn-67-P6730_1967441:1389-nf] -without a touch, and without a word, by His silent power and simple will. Well, but what necessity was there for Christ, who had been once for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and sins, and had proved Himself such by His acts,[fn-67-P6731_1967709:1390-nf] to busy Himself with inquiries[fn-67-P6732_1967822:1391-nf] into the qualities and details of cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law in the person of Christ? If any pan of this healing was effected by Him in a way different from the law, He yet Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord may by Himself, or by His Son, produce after one manner, and after another manner by His servants the prophets, those proofs of His power and might especially, which (as excelling in glory and strength, because they are His own acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done by His servants. But enough has been already said on this point in a former passage.[fn-67-P6733_1968501:1392-nf] Now, although He said in a preceding chapter,[fn-67-P6734_1968579:1393-nf] that \"there were many lepers in lsrµl in the days of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian,\" yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a difference in the gods, as tending to the abasement[fn-67-P6735_1968858:1394-nf] of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence of Him who healed ten. For who can doubt that many might have been cured by Him who cured one more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But His main purpose in this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the pride of Israel, in that (although there were many lepers amongst them, and a prophet was not wanting to them) not one had been moved even by so conspicuous an example to betake himself to God who was working in His prophets. Forasmuch, then, as He was Himself the veritable[fn-67-P6736_1969446:1395-nf] High Priest of God the Father, He inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that Christ was the true distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of mankind. However, what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be done: \"Go,\" said He, \"show yourselves to the priests.\"[fn-67-P6737_1969957:1396-nf] Yet why this, if He meant to cleanse them first? Was it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to them that, having been cured already on the road, the law was now nothing to them, nor even the priests? Well, the matter must of course pass as it best may,[fn-67-P6738_1970242:1397-nf] if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these![fn-67-P6739_1970327:1398-nf] But there are certainly better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving of belief: how that they were cleansed on this account, because[fn-67-P6740_1970509:1399-nf] they were obedient, and went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the priests; and it is not to be believed that persons who observed the law could have found a cure from a god that was destroying the law. Why, however, did He not give such a command to the leper who first returned?[fn-67-P6741_1970858:1400-nf] Because Elisha did not in the case of Naaman the Syrian, and yet was not on that account less the Creator's agent? This is a sufficient answer.But the believer knows that there is a profounder reason. Consider, therefore, the true motives.[fn-67-P6742_1971139:1401-nf] The miracle was performed in the district of Samaria, to which country also belonged one of the lepers.[fn-67-P6743_1971260:1402-nf] Samaria, however, had revolted from Israel, carrying with it the disaffected nine tribes,[fn-67-P6744_1971374:1403-nf] which, having been alienated[fn-67-P6745_1971836:1404-nf] by the prophet Ahijah,[fn-67-P6746_1971877:1405-nf] Jeroboam settled in Samaria.

And yet who was the God to whom the Samaritan gave thanks, because thus far not even had an Israelite heard of another god? Who else but He by whom all had hitherto been healed through Christ? And therefore it was said to him, \"Thy faith hath made thee whole,\"[fn-67-P6759_1973994:1418-nf] because he had discovered that it was his duty to render the true oblation to Almighty God-even thanksgiving-in His true temple, and before His true High Priest Jesus Christ. But it is impossible either that the Pharisees should seem to have inquired of the Lord about the coming of the kingdom of the rival god, when no other god has ever yet been announced by Christ; or that He should have answered them concerning the kingdom of any other god than Him of whom they were in the habit of asking Him. \"The kingdom of God,\" He says, \"cometh not with observation; neither do they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-67-P6760_1974673:1419-nf] Now, who will not interpret the words \"within you\" to mean in your hand, within your power, if you hear, and do the commandment of God?

Judge, then, what the sort of punishment is which He so severely threatens. For it is no stranger who is to avenge the offence done to His disciples. Recognise also in Him the Judge, and one too, who expresses Himself on the safety of His followers with the same tenderness as that which the Creator long ago exhibited: \"He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of my eye.\"[fn-67-P6719_1965264:1378-nf] Such identity of care proceeds from one and the same Being. A trespassing brother He will have rebuked.[fn-67-P6720_1965390:1379-nf] If one failed in this duty of reproof, he in fact sinned, either because out of hatred he wished his brother to continue in sin, or else spared him from mistaken friendship,[fn-67-P6721_1965587:1380-nf] although possessing the injunction in Leviticus: \"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thy neighbor thou shalt seriously rebuke, and on his account shalt not contract sin.\"[fn-67-P6722_1965851:1381-nf] Nor is it to be wondered at, if He thus teaches who forbids your refusing to bring back even your brother's cattle, if you find them astray in the road; much more should you bring back your erring brother to himself. He commands you to forgive your brother, should he trespass against you even \"seven times.\"[fn-67-P6723_1966437:1382-nf] But that surely, is a small matter; for with the Creator there is a larger grace, when He sets no limits to forgiveness, indefinitely charging you \"not to bear any malice against your brother,\"[fn-67-P6724_1966654:1383-nf] and to give not merely to him who asks, but even to him who does not ask. For His will is, not that you should forgive[fn-67-P6725_1966796:1384-nf] an offence, but forget it. The law about lepers had a profound meaning as respects[fn-67-P6726_1966895:1385-nf] the forms of the disease itself, and of the inspection by the high priest.[fn-67-P6727_1966997:1386-nf] The interpretation of this sense it will be our task to ascertain. Marcion's labour, however, is to object to us the strictness[fn-67-P6728_1967158:1387-nf] of the law, with the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its enemy-forestalling[fn-67-P6729_1967269:1388-nf] its enactments even in His cure of the ten lepers. These He simply commanded to show themselves to the priest; \"and as they went, He cleansed them\"[fn-67-P6730_1967441:1389-nf] -without a touch, and without a word, by His silent power and simple will. Well, but what necessity was there for Christ, who had been once for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and sins, and had proved Himself such by His acts,[fn-67-P6731_1967709:1390-nf] to busy Himself with inquiries[fn-67-P6732_1967822:1391-nf] into the qualities and details of cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law in the person of Christ? If any pan of this healing was effected by Him in a way different from the law, He yet Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord may by Himself, or by His Son, produce after one manner, and after another manner by His servants the prophets, those proofs of His power and might especially, which (as excelling in glory and strength, because they are His own acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done by His servants. But enough has been already said on this point in a former passage.[fn-67-P6733_1968501:1392-nf] Now, although He said in a preceding chapter,[fn-67-P6734_1968579:1393-nf] that \"there were many lepers in lsrµl in the days of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian,\" yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a difference in the gods, as tending to the abasement[fn-67-P6735_1968858:1394-nf] of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence of Him who healed ten. For who can doubt that many might have been cured by Him who cured one more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But His main purpose in this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the pride of Israel, in that (although there were many lepers amongst them, and a prophet was not wanting to them) not one had been moved even by so conspicuous an example to betake himself to God who was working in His prophets. Forasmuch, then, as He was Himself the veritable[fn-67-P6736_1969446:1395-nf] High Priest of God the Father, He inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that Christ was the true distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of mankind. However, what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be done: \"Go,\" said He, \"show yourselves to the priests.\"[fn-67-P6737_1969957:1396-nf] Yet why this, if He meant to cleanse them first? Was it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to them that, having been cured already on the road, the law was now nothing to them, nor even the priests? Well, the matter must of course pass as it best may,[fn-67-P6738_1970242:1397-nf] if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these![fn-67-P6739_1970327:1398-nf] But there are certainly better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving of belief: how that they were cleansed on this account, because[fn-67-P6740_1970509:1399-nf] they were obedient, and went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the priests; and it is not to be believed that persons who observed the law could have found a cure from a god that was destroying the law. Why, however, did He not give such a command to the leper who first returned?[fn-67-P6741_1970858:1400-nf] Because Elisha did not in the case of Naaman the Syrian, and yet was not on that account less the Creator's agent? This is a sufficient answer.But the believer knows that there is a profounder reason. Consider, therefore, the true motives.[fn-67-P6742_1971139:1401-nf] The miracle was performed in the district of Samaria, to which country also belonged one of the lepers.[fn-67-P6743_1971260:1402-nf] Samaria, however, had revolted from Israel, carrying with it the disaffected nine tribes,[fn-67-P6744_1971374:1403-nf] which, having been alienated[fn-67-P6745_1971836:1404-nf] by the prophet Ahijah,[fn-67-P6746_1971877:1405-nf] Jeroboam settled in Samaria. Besides, the Samaritans were always pleased with the mountains and the wells of their ancestors. Thus, in the Gospel of John, the woman of Samaria, when conversing with the Lord at the well, says, \"No doubt[fn-67-P6747_1972153:1406-nf] Thou art greater,\" etc.; and again, \"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\"[fn-67-P6748_1972317:1407-nf] Accordingly, He who said, \"Woe unto them that trust in the mountain of Samaria,\"[fn-67-P6749_1972424:1408-nf] vouchsafing now to restore that very region, purposely requests the men \"to go and show themselves to the priests,\" because these were to be found only there where the temple was; submitting[fn-67-P6750_1972636:1409-nf] the Samaritan to the Jew, inasmuch as \"salvation was of the Jews,\"[fn-67-P6751_1972740:1410-nf] whether to the Israelite or the Samaritan. To the tribe of Judah, indeed, wholly appertained the promised Christ,[fn-67-P6752_1972876:1411-nf] in order that men might know that at Jerusalem were both the priests and the temple; that there also was the womb[fn-67-P6753_1973024:1412-nf] of religion, and its living fountain, not its mere \"well.\"[fn-67-P6754_1973102:1413-nf] Seeing, therefore, that they recognised[fn-67-P6755_1973178:1414-nf] the truth that at Jerusalem the law was to be fulfilled, He healed them. whose salvation was to come[fn-67-P6756_1973299:1415-nf] of faith[fn-67-P6757_1973332:1416-nf] without the ceremony of the law. Whence also, astonished that one only out of the ten was thankful for his release to the divine grace, He does not command him to offer a gift according to the law, because he had already paid his tribute of gratitude when \"he glorified God;[fn-67-P6758_1973631:1417-nf] for thus did the Lord will that the law's requirement should be interpreted. And yet who was the God to whom the Samaritan gave thanks, because thus far not even had an Israelite heard of another god? Who else but He by whom all had hitherto been healed through Christ? And therefore it was said to him, \"Thy faith hath made thee whole,\"[fn-67-P6759_1973994:1418-nf] because he had discovered that it was his duty to render the true oblation to Almighty God-even thanksgiving-in His true temple, and before His true High Priest Jesus Christ. But it is impossible either that the Pharisees should seem to have inquired of the Lord about the coming of the kingdom of the rival god, when no other god has ever yet been announced by Christ; or that He should have answered them concerning the kingdom of any other god than Him of whom they were in the habit of asking Him. \"The kingdom of God,\" He says, \"cometh not with observation; neither do they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-67-P6760_1974673:1419-nf] Now, who will not interpret the words \"within you\" to mean in your hand, within your power, if you hear, and do the commandment of God? If, however, the kingdom of God lies in His commandment, set before your mind Moses on the other side, according to our antitheses, and you will find the self-same view of the case.[fn-67-P6761_1975019:1420-nf] \"The commandment is not a lofty one,[fn-67-P6762_1975080:1421-nf] neither is it far off from thee. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, `Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 'nor is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, `Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 'But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy hands, to do it.\"[fn-67-P6763_1975526:1422-nf] This means, \"Neither in this place nor that place is the kingdom of God; for, behold, it is within you.\"[fn-67-P6764_1975658:1423-nf] And if the heretics, in their audacity, should contend that the Lord did not give an answer about His own kingdom, but only about the Creator's kingdom, concerning which they had inquired, then the following words are against them. For He tells them that \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected,\" before His coming,[fn-67-P6765_1976015:1424-nf] at which His kingdom will be really[fn-67-P6766_1976075:1425-nf] revealed. In this statement He shows that it was His own kingdom which His answer to them had contemplated, and which was now awaiting His own sufferings and rejection. But having to be rejected and afterwards to be acknowledged, and taken up[fn-67-P6767_1976344:1426-nf] and glorified, He borrowed the very word \"rejected\" from the passage, where, under the figure of a stone, His twofold manifestation was celebrated by David-the first in rejection, the second in honour: \"The stone,\" says He, \"which the builders rejected, is become the head-stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing.\"[fn-67-P6768_1976682:1427-nf] Now it would be idle, if we believed that God had predicted the humiliation, or even the glory, of any Christ at all, that He could have signed His prophecy for any but Him whom He had foretold under the figure of a stone, and a rock, and a mountain.[fn-67-P6769_1976958:1428-nf] If, however, He speaks of His own coming, why does He compare it with the days of Noe and of Lot,[fn-67-P6770_1977100:1429-nf] which were dark and terrible-a mild and gentle God as He is? Why does He bid us \"remember Lot's wife,\"[fn-67-P6771_1977230:1430-nf] who despised the Creator's command, and was punished for her contempt, if He does not come with judgment to avenge the infraction of His precepts? If He really does punish, like the Creator,[fn-67-P6772_1977445:1431-nf] if He is my Judge, He ought not to have adduced examples for the purpose of instructing me from Him whom He yet destroys, that He[fn-67-P6773_1977593:1432-nf] might not seem to be my instructor. But if He does not even here speak of His own coming, but of the coming of the Hebrew Christ,[fn-67-P6774_1977748:1433-nf] let us still wait in expectation that He will vouchsafe to us some prophecy of His own advent; meanwhile we will continue to believe that He is none other than He whom He reminds us of in every passage.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"162","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"116. \"Be good to me.\" \"Why dost thou ask what thou hast denied [to Me]?

For whether he speaks of the love which is due to God, or that which is due to one's neighbor-in either case, the Creator's grace is meant: for it is He who enjoins the first in these words, \"Thou shalt love God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength; \"[fn-73-P7328_2116186:174-nf] and also the second in another passage: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-73-P7329_2116290:175-nf] \"But he that troubleth you shall have to bear judgment.\"[fn-73-P7330_2116368:176-nf] From what God? From (Marcion's) most excellent god? But he does not execute judgment. From the Creator? But neither will He condemn the maintainer of circumcision. Now, if none other but the Creator shall be found to execute judgment, it follows that only He, who has determined on the cessation of the law, shall be able to condemn the defenders of the law; and what, if he also affirms the law in that portion of it where it ought (to be permanent)? \"For,\" says he, \"all the law is fulfilled in you by this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.' \"[fn-73-P7331_2116943:177-nf] If, indeed, he will have it that by the words \"it is fulfilled\" it is implied that the law no longer has to be fulfilled, then of course he does not mean that I should any more love my neighbour as myself, since this precept must have ceased together with the law. But no! we must evermore continue to observe this commandment. The Creator's law, therefore, has received the approval of the rival god, who has, in fact, bestowed upon it not the sentence of a summary dismissal,[fn-73-P7332_2117440:178-nf] but the favour of a compendious acceptance;[fn-73-P7333_2117503:179-nf] the gist of it all being concentrated in this one precept!

When, therefore, he says, \"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ,\"[fn-73-P7334_2117837:180-nf] since this cannot be accomplished except a man love his neighbour as himself, it is evident that the precept, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\" (which, in fact, underlies the injunction, \"Bear ye one another's burdens\"), is really \"the law of Christ,\" though literally the law of the Creator. Christ, therefore, is the Creator's Christ, as Christ's law is the Creator's law. \"Be not deceived,[fn-73-P7335_2118258:181-nf] God is not mocked.\"[fn-73-P7336_2118324:182-nf] But Marcion's god can be mocked; for he knows not how to be angry, or how to take vengeance. \"For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\"[fn-73-P7337_2118492:183-nf] It is then the God of recompense and judgment who threatens[fn-73-P7338_2118571:184-nf] this. \"Let us not be weary in well-doing; \"[fn-73-P7339_2118632:185-nf] and \"as we have opportunity, let us do good.\"[fn-73-P7340_2118697:186-nf] Deny now that the Creator has given a commandment to do good, and then a diversity of precept may argue a difference of gods.

Now this will be the very perfection of divine power to effect the salvation (of man) in a nature like his own,[fn-78-P7834_2232890:648-nf] For it would be no great matter if the Spirit of God remedied the flesh; but when a flesh, which is the very copy[fn-78-P7835_2233017:649-nf] of the sinning substance-itself flesh also-only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a great thing).

Because he would not have added the attribute \"sinful,\"[fn-78-P7838_2233365:652-nf] if he meant the \"likeness\" to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case he would only have used the word \"flesh,\" and omitted the \"sinful.\" But inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said \"sinful flesh,\" (or \"flesh of sin,\")[fn-78-P7839_2234360:653-nf] he has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose[fn-78-P7840_2234533:654-nf] that the likeness was predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition[fn-78-P7841_2234765:655-nf] with our own; but true still, as being of a nature[fn-78-P7842_2234831:656-nf] not really unlike ours.[fn-78-P7843_2235083:657-nf] And again, in contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness. The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he would not have us \"live in the flesh,\" although in the flesh-even by not living in the works of the flesh[fn-78-P7846_2236549:660-nf] -he shows that when he wrote the words, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-78-P7847_2236670:661-nf] it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,[fn-78-P7848_2236925:662-nf] not on the substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if \"the body indeed is dead because of sin\" (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the body), \"but the spirit is life because of righteousness,\"[fn-78-P7849_2237246:663-nf] it follows that this life accrues to that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the body[fn-78-P7850_2237401:664-nf] is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: \"He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\"[fn-78-P7851_2237664:665-nf] In these words he both affirmed the resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called[fn-78-P7852_2237793:666-nf] body, nor can anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God.

But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things, and blessed them? \"Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\"[fn-78-P7874_2244046:688-nf] For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces a woe.[fn-78-P7875_2244123:689-nf] \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\"[fn-78-P7876_2244180:690-nf] (Like unto which is the Creator's precept: ) \"Thou shalt not remember thy brother's evil against thee.\"[fn-78-P7877_2244305:691-nf] (Again: ) \"Avenge not yourselves; \"[fn-78-P7878_2244366:692-nf] for it is written, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"[fn-78-P7879_2244457:693-nf] \"Live peaceably with all men.\"[fn-78-P7880_2244538:694-nf] The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense. Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion's god (after all).[fn-78-P7882_2245034:696-nf] If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator's Christ, what is the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it? \"[fn-78-P7883_2245389:697-nf] In vain has (our man of) Pontus laboured to deny this statement.[fn-78-P7884_2245474:698-nf] If the gospel has not fulfilled the law, then all I can say is,[fn-78-P7885_2245698:699-nf] the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the Father \"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-78-P7832_2232206:646-nf] it must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom. For he in a previous verse ascribed sin to the flesh, and made it out to be \"the law of sin dwelling in his members,\" and \"warring against the law of the mind.\"[fn-78-P7833_2232476:647-nf] On this account, therefore, (does he mean to say that) the Son was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might redeem this sinful flesh by a like substance, even a fleshly one, which bare a resemblance to sinful flesh, although it was itself free from sin. Now this will be the very perfection of divine power to effect the salvation (of man) in a nature like his own,[fn-78-P7834_2232890:648-nf] For it would be no great matter if the Spirit of God remedied the flesh; but when a flesh, which is the very copy[fn-78-P7835_2233017:649-nf] of the sinning substance-itself flesh also-only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a great thing). The likeness, therefore, will have reference to the quality[fn-78-P7836_2233215:650-nf] of the sinfulness, and not to any falsity[fn-78-P7837_2233273:651-nf] of the substance. Because he would not have added the attribute \"sinful,\"[fn-78-P7838_2233365:652-nf] if he meant the \"likeness\" to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case he would only have used the word \"flesh,\" and omitted the \"sinful.\" But inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said \"sinful flesh,\" (or \"flesh of sin,\")[fn-78-P7839_2234360:653-nf] he has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose[fn-78-P7840_2234533:654-nf] that the likeness was predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition[fn-78-P7841_2234765:655-nf] with our own; but true still, as being of a nature[fn-78-P7842_2234831:656-nf] not really unlike ours.[fn-78-P7843_2235083:657-nf] And again, in contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness.

For this results in their case, not from any feeling of goodness, but from the exigencies of solitude, and when they have secured an opportunity of hurting some one, at once they produce the poison stored up in them, and show the ferocity of their nature. And so in the case of men who are aiming at perfection, it is not enough not to be angry with men. For we recollect that when we were living in solitude a feeling of irritation would creep over us against our pen because it was too large or too small; against our penknife when it cut badly and with a blunt edge what we wanted cut; and against a flint if by chance when we were rather late and hurrying to the reading, a spark of fire flashed out, so that we could not remove and get rid of our perturbation of mind except by cursing the senseless matter, or at least the devil. Wherefore for a method of perfection it will not be of any use for there to be a dearth of men against whom our anger might be roused: since, if patience has not already been acquired, the feelings of passion which still dwell in our hearts can equally well spend themselves on dumb things and paltry objects, and not allow us to gain a continuous state of peacefulness, or to be free from our remaining faults: unless perhaps we think that some advantage and a sort of cure may be gained for our passion from the fact that inanimate and speechless things cannot possibly reply to our curses and rage, nor provoke our ungovernable temper to break out into a worse madness of passion.","title":"Book VIII.

A luxurious niceness seeks everything, attempts everything, forces everything, coerces nature. Men play the part of women, and women that of men, contrary to nature; women are at once wives and husbands: no passage is closed against libidinousness; and their promiscuous lechery is a public institution, and luxury is domesticated. O miserable spectacle! horrible conduct! Such are the trophies of your social licentiousness which are exhibited: the evidence of these deeds are the prostitutes. Alas for such wickedness! Besides, the wretches know not how many tragedies the uncertainty of intercourse produces. For fathers, unmindful of children of theirs that have been exposed, often without their knowledge, have intercourse with a son that has debauched himself, and daughters that are prostitutes; and licence in lust shows them to be the men that have begotten them. These things your wise laws allow: people may sin legally; and the execrable indulgence in pleasure they call a thing indifferent. They who commit adultery against nature think themselves free from adultery. Avenging justice follows their audacious deeds, and, dragging on themselves inevitable calamity, they purchase death for a small sum of money. The miserable dealers in these wares sail, bringing a cargo of fornication, like wine or oil; and others, far more wretched, traffic in pleasures as they do in bread and sauce, not heeding the words of Moses, \"Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore, lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.\"[fn-43-P4319_1334108:36-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":19,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But let us see the manner in which this Celsus, who professes to know everything, brings a false accusation against the Jews, when he alleges that \"they worship angels, and are addicted to sorcery, in which Moses was their instructor.\" Now, in what part of the writings of Moses he found the lawgiver laying down the worship of angels, let him tell, who professes to know all about Christianity and Judaism; and let him show also how sorcery can exist among those who have accepted the Mosaic law, and read the injunction, \"Neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them.\"[fn-77-P7764_1832174:47-nf] Moreover, he promises to show afterwards \"how it was through ignorance that the Jews were deceived and led into error.\" Now, if he had discovered that the ignorance of the Jews regarding Christ was the effect of their not having heard the prophecies about Him, he would show with truth how the Jews fell into error. But without any wish whatever that this should appear, he views as Jewish errors what are no errors at all. And Celsus having promised to make us acquainted, in a subsequent part of his work, with the doctrines of Judaism, proceeds in the first place to speak of our Saviour as having been the leader of our generation, in so far as we are Christians,[fn-77-P7765_1832861:48-nf] and says that \"a few years ago he began to teach this doctrine, being regarded by Christians as the Son of God.\" Now, with respect to this point-His prior existence a few years ago-we have to remark as follows. Could it have come to pass without divine assistance, that Jesus, desiring during these years to spread abroad His words and teaching, should have been so successful, that everywhere throughout the world, not a few persons, Greeks as well as Barbarians, learned as well as ignorant, adopted His doctrine, so that they struggled, even to death in its defence, rather than deny it, which no one is ever related to have done for any other system? I indeed, from no wish to flatter[fn-77-P7766_1833616:49-nf] Christianity, but from a desire thoroughly to examine the facts, would say that even those who are engaged in the healing of numbers of sick persons, do not attain their object-the cure of the body-without divine help; and if one were to succeed in delivering souls from a flood of wickedness, and excesses, and acts of injustice, and from a contempt of God, and were to show, as evidence of such a result, one hundred persons improved in their natures (let us suppose the number to be so large), no one would reasonably say that it was without divine assistance that he had implanted in those hundred individuals a doctrine capable of removing so many evils. And if any one, on a candid consideration of these things, shall admit that no improvement ever takes place among men without divine help, how much more confidently shall he make the same assertion regarding Jesus, when he compares the former lives of many converts to His doctrine with their after conduct, and reflects in what acts of licentiousness and injustice and covetousness they formerly indulged, until, as Celsus, and they who think with him, allege, \"they were deceived,\" and accepted a doctrine which, as these individuals assert, is destructive of the life of men; but who, from the time that they adopted it, have become in some way meeker, and more religious, and more consistent, so that certain among them, from a desire of exceeding chastity, and a wish to worship God with greater purity, abstain even from the permitted indulgences of (lawful) love.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":19,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_58_book_iv_","source_chapter":95,"source_paragraph":"381","folder":"ANF-04","text":"The true God, however, neither employs irrational animals, nor any individuals whom chance may offer,[fn-97-P9729_2530123:373-nf] to convey a knowledge of the future; but, on the contrary, the most pure and holy of human souls, whom He inspires and endows with prophetic power.

For our Lord would have nothing done to His honour and glory without being tempered by judgment, for \"the honour of a king loveth judgment,\"[fn-64-P6416_2291853:38-nf] and therefore Solomon, the wisest of men, urges us not to let our judgment incline to either side, saying: \"Honour God with thy righteous labours and offer to Him of the fruits of thy righteousness.\"[fn-64-P6417_2292081:39-nf] For we have residing in our conscience an uncorrupt and true judge who sometimes, when all are wrong, is the only person not deceived as to the state of our purity. And so with all care and pains we should preserve a constant purpose in our circumspect heart for fear lest if the judgment of our discretion goes wrong, we may be fired with the desire for an ill-considered abstinence, or allured by the wish for an excessive relaxation, and so weigh the substance of our strength in the tongue of an unfair balance; but we should place in one of the scales our purity of soul, and in the other our bodily strength, and weigh them both in the true judgment of conscience, so that we may not perversely incline the scale of fairness to either side, either to undue strictness or to excessive relaxation, from the preponderating desire for one or the other, and so have this said to us by reason of excessive strictness or relaxation: \"If thou offerest rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned?\"[fn-64-P6418_2293111:40-nf] For those offerings of fasts, which we thoughtlessly extort by violently tearing our bowels, and fancy that we rightly offer to the Lord, these He execrates who \"loves mercy and judgment\" saying: \"I the Lord love judgment, but I hate robbery in a burnt offering.\"[fn-64-P6419_2293398:41-nf] Those also who take the main part of their offerings, i.e., their offices and actions, to benefit the flesh for their own use, but leave the remains of them and a tiny portion for the Lord, these the Divine Word thus condemns as fraudulent workmen: \"Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord fraudulently.\"[fn-64-P6420_2293749:42-nf] It is not then without reason that the Lord reproves him who thus deceives himself by unfair considerations, saying: \"But vain are the children of men: the children of men are liars upon the balances that they may deceive.\"[fn-64-P6421_2293995:43-nf] And therefore the blessed Apostle warns us to keep hold of the reins of discretion and not to be attracted by excess and swerve to either side, saying: \"Your reasonable service.\"[fn-64-P6422_2294200:44-nf] And the giver of the law similarly forbids the same thing, saying: \"Let the balance be just and the weights equal, the bushel just and the sextarius equal,\"[fn-64-P6423_2294375:45-nf] and Solomon also gives a like opinion on this matter: \"Great and small weights and double measures are both unclean before the Lord, and one who uses them shall be hindered in his contrivances.\"[fn-64-P6424_2294589:46-nf] Further not only in the way in which we have said, but also in this must we strive not to have unfair weights in our hearts, nor double measures in the storehouse of our conscience, i.e., not to overwhelm those, to whom we are to preach the word of the Lord, with precepts that are too strict and heavier than we ourselves can bear, while we take for granted that for ourselves those things which have to do with the rule of strictness are to be softened by a freer allowance of relaxation. For when we do this, what is it but to weigh and measure the goods and fruits of the Lord's commands in a double weight and measure? For if we dispense them in one way to ourselves and in another to our brethren, we are rightly blamed by the Lord because we have unfair balances and double measures, in accordance with the saying of Solomon which tells us that \"A double weight is an abomination to the Lord, and a deceitful balance is not good in His sight.\"[fn-64-P6425_2295563:47-nf] In this way also we plainly incur the guilt of using a deceitful weight and a double measure, if out of the desire for the praise of men, we make a show before the brethren of greater strictness than what we practice in private in our own cells, trying to appear more abstinent and holier in the sight of men than in the sight of God, an evil which we should not only avoid but actually loathe.

The Lord Jesus declares that He is giving His disciples a new commandment, that they should love one another. \"A new commandment,\" He says, \"I give unto you, that ye love one another.\" But was not this already commanded in the ancient law of God, where it is written, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\"?[fn-25-P2597_1528576:1-nf] Why, then, is it called a new one by the Lord, when it is proved to be so old? Is it on this account a new commandment, because He hath divested us of the old, and clothed us with the new man? For it is not indeed every kind of love that renews him that listens to it, or rather yields it obedience, but that love regarding which the Lord, in order to distinguish it from all carnal affection, added, \"as I have loved you.\" For husbands and wives love one another, and parents and children, and all other human relationships that bind men together: to say nothing of the blame-worthy and damnable love which is mutually felt by adulterers and adulteresses, by fornicators and prostitutes, and all others who are knit together by no human relationship, but by the mischievous depravity of human life. Christ, therefore, hath given us a new commandment, that we should love one another, as He also hath loved us. This is the love that renews us, making us new men, heirs of the New Testament, singers of the new song. It was this love, brethren beloved, that renewed also those of olden time, who were then the righteous, the patriarchs and prophets, as it did afterwards the blessed apostles: it is it, too, that is now renewing the nations, and from among the universal race of man, which overspreads the whole world, is making and gathering together a new people, the body of the newly-married spouse of the only-begotten Son of God, of whom it is said in the Song of Songs, \"Who is she that ascendeth, made white?\"[fn-25-P2598_1530111:2-nf] Made white indeed, because renewed; and how, but by the new commandment? Because of this, the members thereof have a mutual interest in one another; and if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; and one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.[fn-25-P2599_1530857:3-nf] For this they hear and observe, \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another:\" not as those love one another who are corrupters, nor as men love one another in a human way; but they love one another as those who are God's, and all of them sons of the Highest, and brethren, therefore, of His only Son, with that mutual love wherewith He loved them, when about to lead them on to the goal were all sufficiency should be theirs, and where their every desire should be satisfied with good things.[fn-26-P2600_1531390:4-nf] For then there will be nothing wanting they can desire, when God will be all in all.[fn-26-P2601_1531491:5-nf] An end like that has no end. No one dieth there, where no one arriveth save he that dieth to this world, not that universal kind of death whereby the body is bereft of the soul; but the death of the elect, through which, even while still remaining in this mortal flesh, the heart is set on the things which are above. Of such a death it is that the apostle said, \"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\"[fn-26-P2602_1531932:6-nf] And perhaps to this, also, do the words refer,\"Love is strong as death.\"[fn-26-P2603_1532021:7-nf] For by this love it is brought about, that, While still held in the present corruptible body, we die to this world, and our life is hid with Christ in God; yea, that love itself is our death to the world, and our life with God. For if that is death when the soul quits the body, how can it be other than death when our love quits the world? Such love, therefore, is strong as death. And what is stronger than that which bindeth the world?","title":"Tractate LXV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_94_epistle_lxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-05","text":"2. But, moreover, the very interrogation which is put in baptism is a witness of the truth. For when we say, \"Dost thou believe in eternal life and remission of sins through the holy Church? \"we mean that remission of sins is not granted except in the Church, and that among heretics, where there is no Church, sins cannot be put away. Therefore they who assert that heretics can baptize, must either change the interrogation or maintain the truth; unless indeed they attribute a church also to those who, they contend, have baptism. It is also necessary that he should be anointed who is baptized; so that, having received the chrism,[fn-62-P6211_1965122:11-nf] that is, the anointing, he may be anointed of God, and have in him the grace of Christ.
