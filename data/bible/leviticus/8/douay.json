{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Take Aaron with his sons, their vestments, and the oil of unction:\na calf for sin, two rams, a basket with unleavened bread.","And thou shalt gather together all the congregation to the door of\nthe tabernacle.","And Moses did as the Lord had commanded.  And all the multitude\nbeing gathered together before the door of the tabernacle:","He said:  This is the word that the Lord hath commanded to be done.","And immediately, he offered Aaron and his sons.  And when he had\nwashed them,","He vested the high priest with the strait linen garment, girding\nhim with the girdle, and putting on him the violet tunick:  and over it\nhe put the ephod.","And binding it with the girdle, he fitted it to the rational, on\nwhich was Doctrine and Truth.","He put also the mitre upon his head:  and upon the mitre over the\nforehead, he put the plate of gold, consecrated with sanctification, as\nthe Lord had commanded him.","He took also the oil of unction, with which he anointed the\ntabernacle, with all the furniture thereof.","And when he had sanctified and sprinkled the altar seven times,\nhe anointed it, and all the vessels thereof:  and the laver with the\nfoot thereof, he sanctified with the oil.","And he poured it upon Aaron's head:  and he anointed and\nconsecrated him.","And after he had offered his sons, he vested them with linen\ntunicks, and girded them with girdles:  and put mitres on them as the\nLord had commanded.","He offered also the calf for sin:  and when Aaron and his sons had\nput their hands upon the head thereof,","He immolated it:  and took the blood, and dipping his finger in\nit, he touched the horns of the altar round about.  Which being\nexpiated, and sanctified, he poured the rest of the blood at the bottom\nthereof.","But the fat that was upon the entrails, and the caul of the\nliver, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, he burnt upon the\naltar.","And the calf with the skin, and the flesh and the dung, he burnt\nwithout the camp, as the Lord had commanded.","He offered also a ram for holocaust.  And when Aaron and his sons\nhad put their hands upon its head:","He immolated it, and poured the blood thereof round about the\naltar.","And cutting the ram into pieces, the head thereof, and the\njoints, and the fat he burnt in the fire.","Having first washed the entrails, and the feet, and the whole ram\ntogether he burnt upon the altar:  because it was a holocaust of most\nsweet odour to the Lord, as he had commanded him.","He offered also the second ram, in the consecration of priests:\nand Aaron, and his sons put their hands upon the head thereof.","And when Moses had immolated it, he took of the blood thereof,\nand touched the tip of Aaron's right ear, and the thumb of his right\nhand, and in like manner also the great toe of his right foot.","He offered also the sons of Aaron:  and when with the blood of the\nram that was immolated, he had touched the tip of the right ear of\nevery one of them, and the thumbs of their right hands, and the great\ntoes of their right feet, the rest he poured on the altar round about.","But the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that covereth the\nentrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys with their\nfat, and with the right shoulder, he separated.","And taking out of the basket of unleavened bread, which was\nbefore the Lord, a loaf without leaven, and a cake tempered with oil\nand a wafer, he put them upon the fat, and the right shoulder:","Delivering all to Aaron, and to his sons.  Who having lifted them\nup before the Lord,","He took them again from their hands, and burnt them upon the\naltar of holocaust:  because it was the oblation of consecration, for a\nsweet odour of sacrifice to the Lord.","And he took of the ram of consecration, the breast for his\nportion, elevating it before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him.","And taking the ointment, and the blood that was upon the altar,\nhe sprinkled Aaron, and his vestments, and his sons, and their\nvestments with it.","And when he had sanctified them in their vestments, he commanded\nthem, saying:  Boil the flesh before the door of the tabernacle, and\nthere eat it.  Eat ye also the loaves of consecration, that are laid in\nthe basket, as the Lord commanded me, saying:  Aaron and his sons shall\neat them.","And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the loaves, shall\nbe consumed with fire.","And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle for seven\ndays, until the day wherein the time of your consecration shall be\nexpired.  For in seven days the consecration is finished:","As at this present it hath been done, that the rite of the\nsacrifice might be accomplished.","Day and night shall you remain in the tabernacle observing the\nwatches of the Lord, lest you die.  For so it hath been commanded me.","And Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord spoke by the\nhand of Moses."]}
