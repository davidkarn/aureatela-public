{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel:  If any man of the\nchildren Israel, or of the strangers that dwell in Israel, give of his\nseed to the idol Moloch, dying let him die.  The people of the land\nshall stone him.","And I will set my face against him:  and I will cut him off from\nthe midst of his people, because he hath given of his seed to Moloch,\nand hath defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my holy name.","And if the people of the land neglecting, and as it were little\nregarding my commandment, let alone the man that hath given of his seed\nto Moloch, and will not kill him:","I will set my face against that man, and his kindred, and will\ncut off both him and all that consented with him, to commit fornication\nwith Moloch, out of the midst of their people.","The soul that shall go aside after magicians, and soothsayers,\nand shall commit fornication with them:  I will set my face against that\nsoul, and destroy it out of the midst of its people.","Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy:  because I am the Lord your\nGod.","Keep my precepts, and do them.  I am the Lord that sanctify you.","He that curseth his father, or mother, dying let him die.  He hath\ncursed his father, and mother:  let his blood be upon him.","If any man commit adultery with the wife of another, and defile\nhis neighbour's wife:  let them be put to death, both the adulterer and\nthe adulteress.","If a man lie with his stepmother, and discover the nakedness of\nhis father, let them both be put to death:  their blood be upon them.","If any man lie with his daughter in law:  let both die, because\nthey have done a heinous crime.  Their blood be upon them.","If any one lie with a man as with a woman, both have committed\nan abomination:  let them be put to death.  Their blood be upon them.","If any man after marrying the daughter, marry her mother, he\nhath done a heinous crime.  He shall be burnt alive with them:  neither\nshall so great an abomination remain in the midst of you.","He that shall copulate with any beast or cattle, dying let him\ndie:  the beast also ye shall kill.","The woman that shall lie under any beast, shall be killed\ntogether with the same.  Their blood be upon them.","If any man take his sister, the daughter of his father, or the\ndaughter of his mother, and see her nakedness, and she behold her\nbrother's shame:  they have committed a crime.  They shall be slain, in\nthe sight of their people, because they have discovered one another's\nnakedness.  And they shall bear their iniquity.","If any man lie with a woman in her flowers, and uncover her\nnakedness, and she open the fountain of her blood:  both shall be\ndestroyed out of the midst of their people.","Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy aunt by thy mother,\nand of thy aunt by thy father.  He that doth this, hath uncovered the\nshame of his own flesh:  both shall bear their iniquity.","If any man lie with the wife of his uncle by the father, or of\nhis uncle by the mother, and uncover the shame of his near akin, both\nshall bear their sin.  They shall die without children.","He that marrieth his brother's wife, doth an unlawful thing:  he\nhath uncovered his brother's nakedness.  They shall be without children.","Keep my laws and my judgments, and do them:  lest the land into\nwhich you are to enter to dwell therein, vomit you also out.","Walk not after the laws of the nations, which I will cast out\nbefore you.  For they have done all these things:  and therefore I\nabhorred them.","But to you I say:  Possess their land which I will give you for\nan inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.  I am the Lord your\nGod, who have separated you from other people.","Therefore do you also separate the clean beast from the unclean,\nand the clean fowl from the unclean.  Defile not your souls with beasts,\nor birds, or any things that move on the earth, and which I have shewn\nyou to be unclean:","You shall be holy unto me, because I the Lord am holy:  and I\nhave separated you from other people, that you should be mine.","A man, or woman, in whom there is a pythonical or divining\nspirit, dying let them die.  They shall stone them.  Their blood be upon\nthem."]}
