We affirm, two characters of the Christ demonstrated by the prophets, and as many advents of His forenoted: one, in humility (of course the first), when He has to be led \"as a sheep for a victim; and, as a lamb voiceless before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth,\" not even in His aspect comely. For \"we have announced,\" says the prophet, \"concerning Him, (He is) as a little child, as a root in a thirsty land; and there was not in Him attractiveness or glory. And we saw Him, and He had not attractiveness or grace; but His mien was unhonoured, deficient in comparison of the sons of men,\"[fn-24-P2475_806304:320-nf] \"a man set in the plague,[fn-24-P2476_806362:321-nf] and knowing how to bear infirmity: \"to wit as having been set by the Father \"for a stone of offence,\"[fn-24-P2477_806560:322-nf] and \"made a little lower\" by Him \"than angels,\"[fn-24-P2478_806761:323-nf] He pronounces Himself \"a worm, and not a man, an ignominy of man, and the refuse of the People.\"[fn-24-P2479_806917:324-nf] Which evidences of ignobility suit the First Advent, just as those of sublimity do the Second; when He shall be made no longer \"a stone of offence nor a rock of scandal,\" but \"the highest corner-stone,\"[fn-24-P2480_807218:325-nf] after reprobation (on earth) taken up (into heaven) and raised sublime for the purpose of consummation,[fn-24-P2481_807374:326-nf] and that \"rock\"-so we must admit-which is read of in Daniel as forecut from a mount, which shall crush and crumble the image of secular kingdoms.[fn-24-P2482_807545:327-nf] Of which second advent of the same (Christ) Daniel has said: \"And, behold, as it were a Son of man, coming with the clouds of the heaven, came unto the Ancient of days, and was present in His sight; and they who were standing by led (Him) unto Him. And there was given Him royal power; and all nations of the earth, according to their race, and all glory, shall serve Him: and His power is eternal, which shall not be taken away, and His kingdom one which shall not be corrupted.\"[fn-24-P2483_808083:328-nf] Then, assuredly, is He to have an honourable mien, and a grace not \"deficient more than the sons of men; \"for (He will then be) \"blooming in beauty in comparison with the sons of men.\"[fn-24-P2484_808296:329-nf] \"Grace,\" says the Psalmist, \"hath been outpoured in Thy lips: wherefore God hath blessed Thee unto eternity. Gird Thee Thy sword around Thy thigh, most potent in Thy bloom and beauty!\"[fn-24-P2485_808504:330-nf] while the Father withal afterwards, after making Him somewhat lower than angels, \"crowned Him with glory and honour and subjected all things beneath His feet.\"[fn-24-P2486_808687:331-nf] And then shall they \"learn to know Him whom they pierced, and shall beat their breasts tribe by tribe; \"[fn-24-P2487_808847:332-nf] of course because in days bygone they did not know Him when conditionedin the humility of human estate. Jeremiah says: \"He is a human being, and who will learn to know Him? \"[fn-24-P2488_809141:333-nf] because, \"His nativity,\" says Isaiah, \"who shall declare? \"So, too, in Zechariah, in His own person, nay, in the very mystery[fn-24-P2489_809298:334-nf] of His name withal, the most true Priest of the Father, His own[fn-24-P2490_809381:335-nf] Christ, is delineated in a twofold garb with reference to the Two Advents.[fn-24-P2491_809861:336-nf] First, He was clad in \"sordid attire,\" that is, in the indignity of passible and mortal flesh, when the devil, withal, was opposing himself to Him-the instigator, to wit, of Judas the traitor[fn-24-P2492_810164:337-nf] -who even after His baptism had tempted Him. In the next place, He was stripped of His former sordid raiment, and adorned with a garment down to the foot, and with a turban and a clean mitre, that is, (with the garb) of the Second Advent; since He is demonstrated as having attained \"glory and honour.\" Nor will you be able to say that the man (there depicted) is \"the son of Jozadak,\"[fn-24-P2493_810658:338-nf] who was never at all clad in a sordid garment, but was always adorned with the sacerdotal garment, nor ever deprived of the sacerdotal function. But the \"Jesus\"[fn-24-P2494_810941:339-nf] there alluded to is Christ, the Priest of God the most high Father; who at His First Advent came in humility, in human form, and passible, even up to the period of His passion; being Himself likewise made, through all (stages of suffering) a victim for us all; who after His resurrection was\"clad with a garment down to the foot,\"[fn-24-P2495_811293:340-nf] and named the Priest of God the Father unto eternity.[fn-24-P2496_811370:341-nf] So, again, I will make an interpretation of the two goats which were habitually offered on the fast-day.[fn-24-P2497_811526:342-nf] Do not they, too, point to each successive stage in the character of the Christ who is already come? A pair, on the one hand, and consimilar (they were), because of the identity of the Lord's general appearance, inasmuch as He is not to come in some other form, seeing that He has to be recognised by those by whom He was once hurt. But the one of them, begirt with scarlet, amid cursing and universal spitting, and tearing, and piercing, was cast away by the People outside the city into perdition, marked with manifest tokens of Christ's passion; who, after being begirt with scarlet garment, and subjected to universal spitting, and afflicted with all contumelies, was crucified outside the city.[fn-24-P2498_812247:343-nf] The other, however: offered for sins, and given as food to the priests merely of the temple,[fn-24-P2499_812479:344-nf] gave signal evidences of the second appearance; in so far as, after the expiation of all sins, the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, of the church, were to enjoy[fn-25-P2500_812702:345-nf] a spiritual public distribution (as it were) of the Lord's grace, while all others are fasting from salvation.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And it is for this reason that God made the old testament, because it pleased God to veil the heavenly promises in earthly promises, as if established in reward, until the fulness of time; and to give to a people which longed for earthly blessings, and therefore had a hard heart, a law,which, although spiritual, was yet written on tables of stone. Because, with the exception of the sacraments of the old books, which were only enjoined for the sake of their significance (although in them also, since they are to be spiritually understood, the law is rightly called spiritual), the other matters certainly which pertain to piety and to good living must not be referred by any interpretation to some significancy,[fn-54-P5452_2134677:43-nf] but are to be done absolutely as they are spoken. Assuredly no one will doubt that that law of God was necessary not alone for that people at that time, but also is now necessary for us for the right ordering of our life. For if Christ took away from us that very heavy yoke of many observances, so that we are not circumcised according to the flesh, we do not immolate victims of the cattle, we do not rest even from necessary works on the Sabbath, retaining the seventh in the revolution of the days, and other things of this kind; but keep them as spiritually understood, and, the symbolizing shadows being removed, are watchful in the light of those things which are signified by them; shall we therefore say, that when it is written that whoever finds another man's property of any kind that has been lost, should return it to him who has lost it,[fn-54-P5453_2135703:44-nf] it does not pertain to us? and many other like things whereby people learn to live piously and uprightly? and especially theDecalogue itself, which is contained in those two tables of stone, apart from the carnal observance of the Sabbath, which signifies spiritual sanctification and rest?For who can say that Christians ought not to be observant to serve the one God with religious obedience, not to worship an idol, not to take the name of the Lord in vain, to honour one's parents, not to commit adulteries, murders, thefts, false witness, not to covet another man's wife, or anything at all that belongs to another man?
